"The leader in wearable devices is hoping the Fitbit Ionic will drum up interest in its brand and a tech category that's lost some appeal. The ""space-themed"" smartwatch ($299.95) is $30 more than its biggest competitor: the Apple Watch Series 2. That's a hefty price to ask of people who may already own a smartwatch or are cautious about investing in one for the first time. The Ionic has everything you'd expect from a fitness device: sleep and activity tracking, a heart rate monitor, GPS integration, smart notifications and long battery life -- one of its biggest selling points. It'll last up to four days, compared with 18 hours for the Apple Watch. The waterproof Ionic comes sprinkled with additions for fitness fanatics, too. There's a sensor that measures oxygen in the blood and personalized workouts that adapt to your feedback. You can work toward goals -- such as running a mile faster -- listen to audio coaching and store up to 300 songs on the device. The Ionic also features a payments system called Fitbit Pay that allows you to tap the device at checkout to pay. The Ionic is Fitbit's first product with both hardware and software, Fitbit OS, designed in house. Jonah Becker, vice president of design, said the device was inspired by the concept of a ""space journey"" and ""progressive thinking that gets you to a destination."" ""The space theme influences the color palate,"" said Becker, referencing the orange, blue and steel color options. ""Think about 'The Martian' ... think about Elon Musk colonizing Mars ... and the icy landscape of 'Interstellar.'"" Related: Uber taps Expedia's Dara Khosrowshahi as CEO The Ionic features a lightweight casing made of aluminum and a colored spherical glass touch screen. The company flirted with a smartwatch before with the Fitbit Blaze. But CEO James Park previously said the category didn't make sense for the company -- that smartwatches lacked ""purpose."" Now it's changed its mind. ""We're not entering the category for the sake of entering the category,"" Park told a group of reporters in New York City last week. ""For us, there's a purpose. We feel very strongly that smartwatches are a platform for us to deliver the most powerful tools the market has seen. The larger form factor of smartwatches versus activity and fitness trackers allow us to integrate many more advanced sensors and provide richer displays and user interfaces."" But Fitbit (FIT) has catching up to do. Smartwatches are a $10 billion market, and that's expected to double in four years, according to IDC. But shipments of wearables were also down late last year compared with the year before. Experts believe the category will surge again once smartwatches are freed from the smartphone. The Ionic, like the Apple Watch, requires a sync from a smartphone, but Fitbit plans to launch a version next year that won't. And the pay feature already means you can leave your wallet at home. The Ionic also comes with apps from Starbucks (SBUX) and AccuWeather and music streaming from Pandora. Other developers can start building apps for the Ionic starting in September. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is expected to launch a cellular version next month. Body Smart: Can a week of wearables improve your health? Apple also recently reported its best quarter yet for wearables. Fitbit's stock has plunged 60% in the past year and now trades 70% below the IPO price. Yet it still holds the No. 1 spot for health app downloads on iTunes and Android. In addition to the Ionic smartwatch, the company revealed its first Bluetooth wireless earbuds and a second version of the popular Aria smart scale. It also promoted future Ionic features, including sleep apnea tracking, and its vision for disease screening and monitoring for research. Fitbit is emphasizing fashion, too. As with the Fitbit Charge and Alta, you can swap out bands and upgrade to premium options like leather ($29.95 each). Fashion brands like Fossil, and its sub-brands like Kate Spade, Emporio Armani and Michael Kors -- have added smart features to accessories. Fitbit is clearly late to the smartwatch race, and it's unclear whether the Ionic will be enough to fix that. But Park said he's confident Fitbit is the ""best positioned company to have the most profound impact on people's health outside of the healthcare system."""
"So why is the retail giant spending $13.7 billion to acquire 460 brick-and-mortar Whole Foods stores and lower prices on ""organic bananas"" and ""responsibly-farmed salmon?"" Answer: To dominate the grocery business like it has many others by increasing the number of customers while undercutting the competition. Amazon will make Whole Foods more accessible to more consumers. And it will turn them into Amazon customers and advance its bid to become the dominant player in all of retail -- the so-called everything store. ""The pot of gold at the end of the road for Amazon is groceries,"" said Cooper Smith, an Amazon analyst at L2 Inc. ""The war for retail will be won in groceries. It's the largest category of consumer retail, and the largest untapped opportunity for Amazon."" Related: Amazon: We're lowering Whole Foods prices on Monday With lower prices for higher quality goods, Amazon is posing a direct threat to America's major supermarkets. The six largest food retailers, which had already taken a hit after the Whole Foods acquisition was announced in June, lost roughly $12 billion in value after Thursday's announcement about the company's intention to lower prices. That market disruption is based not on what Whole Foods is today, but on what it can become. Whole Foods currently represents less than 2% of the overall grocery market. But under Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), those stores will be turned into warehouses that can distribute groceries to homes around the country. Meanwhile, Amazon's distribution centers can also function as Whole Foods (WFM) distribution centers. There is room for expansion, as well. By lowering its prices, Amazon can open new Whole Foods locations in markets that traditionally could not afford high-priced organic bananas and responsibly farmed salmon, making a run at companies like supermarket leaders like WalMart and Kroger. ""Generally Whole Foods goes into markets with six-figure incomes and college-educated residents. But with Amazon lowering Whole Foods' prices, you could get Whole Foods in towns where you don't traditionally see them,"" supermarket analyst David J. Livingston said. ""It could open the doors for any medium-size city in the country."" With every new Whole Foods customer, Amazon will expand its core business, which is based around the Amazon Prime membership. On Thursday, Amazon announced that Amazon Prime will become Whole Foods' customer rewards program, giving Prime members ""special savings and in-store benefits."" Related: Amazon-Whole Foods merger gets green light from U.S. government As consumers grow more comfortable doing their grocery shopping online, Amazon is hoping that Whole Foods customers will become Amazon Prime customers. By then, Amazon Prime could become a one-stop shop for all consumer needs, from groceries and clothes and home appliances to on-demand entertainment and concert tickets. This is where things could get challenging for Amazon. As its consumers base grows, the company will have to drastically increase its shipping and delivery capabilities. ""It's an extremely large undertaking,"" Smith said. ""Amazon has never operated a brick-and-mortar presence at this scale. Wall Street might come down on Amazon a little harder -- might say they're over-leveraged, spending too much money, in a war with WalMart. So they have to maintain the perception that everything is going to be all right."" Amazon's competitors are already taking steps to react. Earlier this week, WalMart (WMT) said that it would start offering its products on Google Express, the search company's online shopping mall. But industry experts say the Google-WalMart deal has little chance of getting in the way of Amazon's ambitions. In a note to clients, Cowen analyst John Blackledge said the partnership ""had little to no impact on Amazon's retail business or the growth of Amazon Prime households."" ""While we are encouraged to see Google continue to enhance its eCommerce/Shopping offering, we believe the attention the announcement received was overblown,"" Blackledge wrote, noting that only 4% of U.S. households that buy products online bought groceries via Google Express in July. Smith dismissed the deal as ""symbolic,"" while Livingston said it seemed like a reactionary move geared toward appeasing shareholders. ""They have to make a change, stay relevant and give shareholders some benefit,"" he said. ""If the shareholders don't see WalMart doing something they get nervous and say maybe we should sell our stock and do something else."" ""Half of Amazon's strategy is to cause a disruption, make other retailers go out and make a mistake because they're just trying to impress shareholders and get in the paper,"" Livingston added. For now, WalMart, Kroger (KR) and a handful of other supermarket companies still dominate the market. But under Amazon, Whole Foods poses a legitimate threat. ""The traditional supermarket is becoming a dinosaur,"" Livingston said. ""It's not going to happen tomorrow, but it's going to happen. We're going to see a shift in the way people shop."""
"The design offers a modern take on a 1930s Inifiniti Grand Prix racecar. Except there weren't any Infiniti racecars in the 1930s. Nissan's luxury brand didn't even exist until 1989. In fact, Infiniti Prototype 9 was originally just going to be a drawing, said Alfonso Albaisa, Nissan's (NSANF) global head of design. It was an idea someone sent him in a text message that he sketched out. But the idea was too good to keep it on paper, he said. ""When we started designing it, engineering got all excited and they said they're in. Then our oldest factory in Japan, Oppama, raised their hand. They're in. So it became a real car out of nowhere,"" Albaisa said. The idea started as: What if Infiniti had been competing against the likes of Germany, France and Italy on Grand Prix racing circuits in the 1930s and 1940s? The concept drew inspiration from the likes of Germany's Silver Arrow cars, made by Mercedes-Benz and Audi, Italy's red Alfettas, made by Alfa Romeo, and bright blue Delahaye 145s from France. Nations were vying to show their engineering talent and, drivers, their courage as the continent spiraled toward toward another war. Far out. Volkswagen plans an electric hippie bus The Prototype 9 looks every bit the part. Its dimensions conform precisely to Grand Prix regulations of the era. One key difference is that, unlike those older cars, the Prototype 9 is an electric car. Its long hood filled with battery packs rather than a combustion engine. That means it runs silently. The cars that inspired it were anything but silent. Mercedes unveils super-long luxury convertible The concept car has a top speed 130 miles an hour, and it's capable of springing from a stop to 60 miles per hour in about five seconds, Albaisa said. He drove it on a test track in Japan where the designer, born in the United States to Cuban immigrant parents, now lives. ""To be honest, when I was going around the track, around the bank, I felt more like a bird than anything. A very low flying bird,"" he said. ""It was silent. I could see the tires next to me, because the position of my head. It was almost poetic."" The most exciting thing for Albaisa wasn't driving the car. It was seeing this one car, by itself, being built in a factory right next to production lines that were turning out other, more modern looking cars in the thousands. ""The passion for building a car, in Japanese is monozukuri, 'making things,'"" he said. ""I find to be something that is inspiring for me."""
"The social media giant released a slate of diverse family emoji recently with skin tones that range from light to dark in recent months. But the update doesn't offer an option for families with mixed backgrounds -- all the members of the emoji families have the same skin tone. The 125 new family emoji options mark the first time black families have been represented as emoji on Facebook, according to a blog post from emoji reference site Emojipedia on Thursday. Facebook told CNN Tech these emoji have been live on its desktop site since April, and that they've gained attention recently because of the post on Emojipedia. Previously, Facebook (FB, Tech30) only offered yellow family emoji, which is a default standard also used by Apple (AAPL, Tech30).  Related: Apple unveils new emoji, including breastfeeding mom The updated family emoji are only available on desktop for now. It's unclear when they will roll out on mobile. Facebook declined to comment further. Last month, Apple announced a new collection of emoji set for release later this year. The Apple offering includes icons such as a woman wearing a headscarf and a breastfeeding mom. The Unicode Consortium, a nonprofit that sets the global standard for emoji and other software, has significantly increased the number of official emoji in recent years. The group has approved 2,666 new emoji as of June, compared to 722 of them two years ago. It has also stepped up efforts to include diverse skin tones, flags and careers."
"Users in the United States who search for ""depression"" or ""clinical depression"" will now be offered a questionnaire to test their depression levels and help determine whether they should seek professional help, Google said in a blog post. Users who search for information on depression will be shown a box at the top of their screen encouraging them to ""check if you're clinically depressed."" The clinically validated test, called PHQ-9, asks about energy, appetite and concentration levels, among other things. The tech firm said it recognized that the information was ""sensitive and private,"" and that it would not store the responses. Google (GOOGL, Tech30) said the initiative was developed in partnership with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). ""The results of the PHQ-9 can help you have a more informed conversation with your doctor,"" wrote Mary Giliberti, CEO of NAMI. Related: Women's voices are often missing in the health care debate Clinical depression affects roughly one in five Americans at some point in their lives. But individuals with depression symptoms take an average of six to eight years before they seek professional help, according to NAMI. ""We hope that by making this information available on Google, more people will become aware of depression and seek treatment to recover and improve their quality of life,"" explained Giliberti. Research released in May found the percentage of younger children and teens hospitalized for suicidal thoughts or actions in the U.S. has doubled over nearly a decade."
"Fowler filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court contesting the use of arbitration agreements, in which employees give up their rights to file class action suits. The court is set to address the issue in three cases it took up last year. Uber is not a party to any of the cases, but Fowler referred to her experience with Uber's arbitration agreements. In February, Fowler alleged pervasive sexism and sexual harassment during her one year tenure at Uber. She had signed the company's class action waiver when she was hired. Related: Why sexism has festered for so long in Silicon Valley ""Employers cannot ... take from employees the right to pursue this form of concerted activity as a condition of employment -- even with the help of an arbitration agreement,"" stated her friend of the court brief. The document, filed this month by Fowler's lawyer Christopher Baker of Baker Curtis & Schwartz, argues that the such agreements run counter to the National Labor Relations Act, which grants employees the right to organize. ""Without the right to collective litigation, there will be more systemic employment law violations, less effective ways to remedy them, and the balance between companies and talent will shift firmly in favor of capital,"" the brief said. Uber and Baker did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Related: Readers react to 'Money, Power, and Sexual Harassment Arbitration agreements are common at ""gig economy"" companies, she noted. At Uber, she claimed in the brief, arbitration agreements have offered the company legal protection from claims of ""stealing driver tips"" and ""failing to pay minimum wage and overtime."" Uber's internal investigation into its workforce culture is complete, and the company has purged a number of top executives -- including CEO Travis Kalanick. But the company is still putting out fires. Among its biggest priorities is finding a new CEO and fighting a lawsuit against Google's Waymo for allegedly using stolen technology."
"The hashtag character (#) popularized on Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) was tweeted for the first time by designer Chris Messina on this day in 2007. He asked his followers: ""how do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp [msg]?"" It's since become a way to track trends and connect with groups on Twitter. A hashtag placed in front of a word on the platform turns ideas, events, or any combination of words into a link that takes you directs you to a larger conversation. For example, people use it to follow along with Game of Thrones, live events and protests, and share support for causes like #PressOn. It's even made its way into our real-life lexicon: It has its own entries in the Oxford and Merriam Webster dictionaries. However, Messina told CNN in 2015 his original suggestion received ""mixed feedback."" ""Some people said 'that sounds fine' ... other people said it was the dumbest idea ever,'' he said. But when his friend started tracking a wildfire in San Diego, Messina told him to use a hashtag so Twitter users could follow the updates. The concept took off from there. how do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp [msg]? But the hashtag wasn't born on Twitter. The hash -- also called the octothorp -- first appeared on touch-tone telephones in the 1960s. We still use the character to interact with automated phone systems. Users on Internet Relay Chat, a popular chat room software, long used the pound sign on the internet to join different channels. It's unclear who invented the IRC hashtag. Facebook (FB, Tech30) adopted hashtags years later in 2013, but it serves the same purpose. Despite being a decade old -- and sometimes considered an eyesore -- hashtags still serve the purpose they were designed to. Millions of people watched the solar eclipse on Monday and shared their experiences with #SolarEclipse2017. Meanwhile, #PhoenixRally trended on Twitter on Tuesday night during President Trump's rally, where large groups of protesters gathered outside his event."
"Nearly 70 days after Uber's CEO resigned, the startup has finally chosen a replacement: Dara Khosrowshahi, currently CEO of Expedia (EXPE). He hasn't officially accepted yet, but is expected to, according to Expedia chairman Barry Diller. If he accepts the position, Khosrowshahi will face a long list of challenges, including reforming Uber's office culture after sexual harassment allegations and curbing its steep losses enough to take the company public. But somewhere near the top of the list is the particularly thorny question of what to do with his predecessor, Travis Kalanick. The two men could not be more different, according to those who know them. Kalanick is a famously brash and combative founder; Khosrowshahi is typically described by friends as an ""adult"" and a ""diplomat."" The future of Uber may rest on them getting along. Related: Uber's next CEO: Who is Dara Khosrowshahi? Kalanick was reluctant to forfeit his spot at the top even amid mounting PR crises. After stepping down in June, Kalanick wanted to plot his way back to being Uber CEO, according to an explosive lawsuit from one of Uber's major investors. He remains a board member and one of Uber's largest shareholders, owning about 10% of Uber's stock and 16% of Uber's voting power, according to the lawsuit from Benchmark Capital. The venture capital firm is suing Kalanick to get him off the board; other Uber investors want Benchmark to leave the board. Perhaps the closest comparison is Twitter. When Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) started searching for a new CEO in 2015, it had three former CEOs still on its board. In the end, however, it chose one of them. Khosrowshahi may be a new face at Uber, but there are some notable ties connecting him to Kalanick -- starting with one media mogul. One source who knows Kalanick says he is close to Diller. Kalanick reportedly set sail around Tahiti in Diller's yacht after stepping down as CEO. And Diller has worked closely with Khosrowshahi at Expedia and IAC/InterActiveCorp. Reps for Uber and IAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ""If Dara does leave us, it will be to my great regret but also my blessing,"" Diller wrote in a memo to all Expedia employees on Monday. ""If this is what he wants for his next adventure it will be with my best wishes."" Diller isn't the only potential intermediary. Hadi and Ali Partovi, twin brothers who cofounded Code.org, also just happen to be early Uber investors and Khosrowshahi's cousins. Hadi, in particular, is close to Emil Michael, Kalanick's former right-hand man. ""It will for sure be a learning curve for Travis,"" Hadi told CNN Tech. ""I don't think it will be a learning curve [for Dara] because he's been working for Barry Diller for almost 20 years and Barry Diller is a strong personality."" Hadi also said Kalanick is ""delighted"" about the board's choice of Khosrowshahi. Related: After fighting Trump, Expedia CEO just wants to get back to work ""Dara has experience running an international travel company. He's the only CEO under consideration that had that experience,"" Hadi said. The two other top candidates were Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE, Tech30) CEO Meg Whitman and Jeff Immelt, the former CEO of General Electric (GE). More to the point: those close to Khosrowshahi say he wouldn't accept the role unless he had assurances the board would not try to roadblock his every move. ""My viewpoint is they've given him that mandate,"" says Woody Marshall, a partner at Technology Crossover Ventures who grew up with Khosrowshahi. As Marshall puts it, ""You can't have me go into a fight with one arm tied behind my back."""
"The iPhone maker's CEO received company stock worth $89 million last week after hitting a key performance target, according to a regulatory filing Monday. The payout is part of the huge welcome package that Apple (AAPL, Tech30) gave Cook after he succeeded Steve Jobs in 2011. Cook only gets the shares in fixed amounts as they vest over a period of years. Half of the latest batch was linked to the performance of Apple's share price compared with those of other S&P 500 companies. Because Apple outperformed more than two-thirds of the companies in the index over the past three years, Cook received the full payout, the filing said. Related: Apple will invest $1.3 billion in Iowa Not all the money ended up in Cook's hands, though. Apple said it set aside about $46 million to meet tax requirements. Cook sold off the other shares between Thursday and Monday for a total of about $43 million. The filing didn't say what Cook plans to do with the money, and an Apple spokesman declined to comment. But the Apple CEO said in 2015 that he plans to give most of his wealth away to charity. The huge stock grant the tech company gave Cook in 2011 was valued at around $380 million at the time. But Apple's share price gains since then mean the nearly 3 million shares that are yet to vest are worth about $484 million at current prices. Cook also currently holds Apple shares worth about $145 million, according to the filing. The company's stock is up nearly 40% so far this year."
"""We're three volunteers looking for anyone with boats that we can jump on and help, over."" These are just two of the messages that came through the walkie-talkie app Zello in one minute on Monday. In communities ravaged by Harvey, floodwaters have left people stranded on rooftops, relying on rescue from volunteers and first responders. Smartphones are their lifelines. On Zello, the volunteer organization Cajun Navy -- founded in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina -- is mobilizing rescuers through a channel called ""Texas search and rescue."" The push-to-talk app lets users send voice messages to different channels that can be heard from anyone listening to the channel. Stranded victims are uploading messages asking for help, while volunteers are talking to them directly, letting them know when help is on the way. People can also talk to each other in private chats. Listen for a few minutes and you can understand how dire the situation is for families trapped in their homes. The relatively unknown communication app is one tech tool groups of volunteers are using to find people in need of rescue. Neighbors, out-of-state volunteers, and even reporters are rescuing stranded residents in Houston and other areas of Texas to assist overburdened first responders. Many people are also using social media to ask for assistance, including Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30). While rescuers use this data to help find folks who need help, groups have also developed a grassroots data effort to collect information about victims and to let people know when they're safe. The Cajun Navy has created an interactive map called ""Hurricane Harvey Rescue."" Those in need of help fill out a Google form and indicate their location. The map populates with the names and locations of people who need rescuing and notes who has been rescued. Team Rubicon, a nonprofit that brings veterans and first responders to disaster zones, is also using the map to chart out where volunteers are most needed. The organization, created in response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, has a network of over 50,000 volunteers. About 20 volunteers will be on the ground in Texas by the end of the day on Monday. Related: How social media is helping Houston deal with Harvey floods Team Rubicon's robust data collection and analysis is a sophisticated way of maintaining communications and organizing people's information in times of crises. David Burke, the vice president of programs and field operations at Team Rubicon, said his organization is compiling data from social networks and the crowdsourced map. The team then cross-references public data with the Social Vulnerability Index, a government resource that uses education, income, rental rates, access to healthcare, and other factors to determine the resiliency of an area. ""This morning when we got up, we were looking at about 600 requests for rescue in the area -- and right now we just crossed over 1,400,"" Burke said. During rescues, teams use mobile devices to collect data and share it with local jurisdictions. FEMA has established guidelines for collecting information about people affected by natural disasters, and some of that data is still collected on paper. Team Rubicon uses mobile forms to automatically upload the data to Excel spreadsheets. It can share this data with law enforcement and policymakers to quickly determine where assistance is most required. A completely tech-oriented operation means data is uploaded automatically; it's a time saver and more reliable than paper which can become damaged or misplaced. ""Mobile collection is, or can be, immediately uploaded to the cloud and begins to paint the picture necessary to apply resources where they can be most effective,"" he said. On Monday, the group got a call from the Texas Department of Emergency Management to help with the damage assessment information collection for the Victoria, Texas area. That data will be used to help determine allocation of federal aid. ""We are trying to share that information early, so people aren't out trying to recollect and reassemble the picture two to three months from now in Houston,"" Burke said."

"""I'm different from many of these young CEOs in that I'm not the founder ... I'm what you'd call 'professional management,'"" he once said. He was talking about being the CEO of online travel company Expedia (EXPE), but the same thing applies to Uber, which on Sunday picked him as its new CEO. Related: Uber taps Expedia's Dara Khosrowshahi as CEO An Iranian refugee who built his early career in the U.S. financial industry, Khosrowshahi is facing a new kind of challenge at the ride-hailing company after 12 years running Expedia. Uber, the world's most valuable startup, is reeling from a catalog of crises culminating in the forced resignation in June of its CEO and co-founder, Travis Kalanick, who remains a powerful shareholder and board member. Here's what you need to know about the man the Uber board has picked to steady the ship:  Fierce competitor Khosrowshahi made a name for himself at Expedia by going on offense against disruptive challengers, buying travel startups and investing heavily in technology to ""stay ahead of the pack,"" he said at a recent tech summit. ""The minute you stop improving on the internet, someone catches up and takes over,"" he told the audience. The 48-year-old executive may need to heed those words at Uber, which is facing growing competition at home and abroad. The ride-hailing startup has been without a CEO since Kalanick stepped down in June and has suffered an exodus of senior managers. Heading Uber will be a big shift for Khosrowshahi in at least one respect -- he'll be going from a perennial underdog to an industry leader. Though he has aggressively expanded Expedia's business over the years, it still trails arch rival Priceline (PCLN, Tech30). Tough start Khosrowshahi took the reins at Expedia in 2005, just as the financial crisis hit. He was a young new leader and readily admits that he wasn't a particularly good CEO during his first year at the helm. Things changed, he says, after an engineer came to him and told him, ""Dara, you're telling us what to do, but you're not telling us where to go."" ""That really shifted my view of what a CEO has to do,"" he said in 2013. ""A CEO of a multinational global company can't say what to do, you've got to plant the flag."" Expedia has prospered under his leadership, despite threats from new rivals like Airbnb and established tech giants like Google (GOOGL, Tech30). Expedia's share price is now more than six times as high as it was when the company went public in 2005. That's impressive growth, but it pales in comparison with that of Priceline's stock, which is worth around 80 times as much as it was in 2005. Related: Got $1750? Book a trip or buy 1 Priceline share Not afraid of Trump Born in Iran, Khosrowshahi immigrated to the United States as a refugee at the age of 9 when his family fled the Iranian Revolution. Khosrowshahi's experience meant President Trump's order earlier this year to suspend immigration from seven Muslim majority countries hit close to home. ""I believe that with this executive order, our president has reverted to the short game,"" he wrote in an internal company memo. The U.S. ""will certainly be seen as a smaller nation, one that is inward-looking versus forward thinking, reactionary versus visionary,"" he continued. Related: After fighting Trump, Expedia CEO just wants to get back to work Expedia was one of the first in the tech industry to file a legal challenge to the president's travel ban. On the day of Trump's inauguration, Khosrowshahi tweeted a new Expedia advertisement touting the importance of travel to fight ""narrow minds"" and ""prejudice."" He also drew attention for saying on an earnings call in February, ""Hopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year."" Khosrowshahi later played down the remark, which was widely interpreted as a dig at Trump, but his concerns about the president's stance remain clear. The American Dream The American dream ""is the best brand out there,"" he said in May. ""It's stronger than Apple and Microsoft and Google combined times 10."" If you believe in democracy and work hard, you can make it, he said, ""and that's what makes this country great, and I think the president should be for that not against it,"" he said. Raised in New York State, he studied electrical engineering at Brown University and became an investment banker shortly after graduation. He rose to vice president at investment bank Allen & Company before leaving for IAC (IAC), working under Chairman Barry Diller. Serial dealmaker Khosrowshahi drove Expedia to success by focusing on growth and dominating the online travel booking industry, especially when it came to hotels and accommodation. Over the years, it bought Trviago, Orbitz, Travelocity and Egencia, gaining access to a trove of data on travel habits. Two years ago, Expedia acquired Airbnb rival HomeAway, getting in on the increasingly popular vacation rental trend. Khosrowshahi became the highest paid CEO in the U.S. in 2015, raking in nearly $95 million thanks to a huge award of stock options after he agreed a deal to stay with Expedia until 2020. But that was before Uber came along."

In Apple's implementation, augmented reality requires you to hold up your phone or tablet to see virtual objects implanted into the real world. For example, the new IKEA Place app -- which will become available with the launch of iOS 11 -- allows you to select furniture from its website and place it virtually within a room. So you can try before you buy. While the virtual furniture doesn't look entirely realistic, it's close. The app measures the room you're in and then places the furniture within it based on the item's real dimensions. That way you can see how a couch or a chair might fit. The company says sizing is about 98% accurate. But the concept isn't entirely new. The Pok¨¦mon Go phenomenon last summer had people all across the country tossing virtual Pok¨¦ Balls into city streets. For AR to work on an iPhone or iPad, an app needs to find a plane -- a floor, a table, some sort of surface for a virtual object to sit on. It then detects the light in the room. Virtual objects can reflect that light and cast a shadow, just like a real object would. Most importantly, an AR application needs to constantly recalculate all of these things, so that when you move your phone, the object stays in place. If you've ever tried to use a Snapchat filter, only to have it flicker and jump around, you know this isn't easy. CNN Tech received an early look at some apps that'll soon incorporate AR. While IKEA Place seems genuinely useful, others miss the mark.  The Giphy World app from GIF search engine Giphy felt a bit gimmicky. The app lets you overlay animated GIFs onto the people and places around you. You can then share that augmented tour with your friends. But it was also easy to see how AR could find a natural place in gaming. ""Arise"" by Climax Studios places its world in front of you, allowing you to walk around or move your phone to adjust the perspective -- rather than relying on buttons or a joystick to move characters. Apple is being coy about new devices -- such as the rumored glasses it's reportedly been working on for years -- that could also incorporate AR in the future. For now, Joswiak said ""rather than require specialized hardware and ... [buying] something new ... all you need is an iPhone or an iPad."""
"Uber board selected Khosrowshahi on Sunday to replace Uber founder Travis Kalanick, who resigned from his CEO duties in June. Uber has been in the spotlight for its toxic culture after a former engineer, Susan Fowler, went public with allegations of sexism and harassment at the company. Her allegations led to a months-long internal investigation, and a purge of top execs. Expedia (EXPE), which Khosrowshahi has led for 12 years, has a very different reputation: It has been lauded for its workplace. Expedia announced in 2016 it had achieved gender parity, meaning men and women are paid equally in equivalent roles. This year, the company reported 50% of its U.S. employees are women, better than the national rate (47%). In addition, 25% of Expedia's computer and math roles are held by women. At Uber, just 15% of its technical workforce are women, according to its first diversity report released in March. That's the same number as Twitter but smaller than Facebook (17%) and Slack (24%). Related: Uber's new CEO will have to deal with Uber's old CEO  Meanwhile, 22% of Uber leadership roles are held by women. But Expedia reports women make up 35% of its leadership roles. (Uber defines leadership as director-level or above; Expedia more broadly defines it as manager-level or above). Overall, Uber had about 12,000 employees when it released its diversity report; Expedia had 20,000 at the end of last year. On pay equity, Uber last month adjusted salaries to ensure its employees are fairly compensated, regardless of gender or race. The move came after the departure of Kalanick. Under Khosrowshahi's leadership, Expedia was among the companies that signed the White House's Equal Pay Pledge in 2016, agreeing to review their hiring and promotion processes to address any inequities. Expedia has been experimenting with efforts like blind resume reviews -- where the name of a candidate is removed -- to see if it impacts hiring. Diversity advocates say the CEO sets the tone and priorities in fostering a company's work culture. Freada Kapor Klein, a leader in championing the diversity push in tech, previously told CNN Tech that ""there's no substitute for unequivocal CEOs at every company."" Kapor Klein, an early investor in Uber, has critiqued Kalanick and Uber over workplace cultural issues. Related: Uber's CEO pick is an outspoken Trump critic Advocate Elizabeth Ames, senior vice president at the Anita Borg Institute, told CNN Tech the gender of a CEO matters less than his or her commitments. The institute puts on the annual Grace Hopper Conference for women in computing and cut ties with Uber in May. ""It's about talent acquisition, talent management, retention, and the overall workforce -- those are CEO issues whether you're male or female,"" said Ames, citing leaders like Salesforce's Marc Benioff and GoDaddy's Blake Irving as examples. Khosrowshahi told Bloomberg Tuesday that a lack of diversity of all kinds is ""definitely a problem"" in tech. ""You look at the problem and solve it one step at a time,"" Khosrowshahi said. ""You solve it by first recognizing it and then working it. It requires real candor and real honesty."""
"The embattled ride-hailing startup officially announced late Tuesday that Dara Khosrowshahi, who's run Expedia for the past 12 years, will be its new chief. ""Dara is the best person to lead Uber into the future,"" the company said in an email to employees that was also posted on its website. He'll attend an all-hands meeting on Wednesday, it said. Uber's board picked Khosrowshahi for the top job on Sunday. But it took another two days to announce the news publicly. Related: Uber's new CEO has a great track record closing the gender pay gap In an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier Tuesday, Khosrowshahi said he was still in the process of finalizing his contract with Uber but planned to take the job. Khosrowshahi has experience running an international travel company, not unlike Uber. He oversaw a publicly traded business making him a good fit to take Uber public. And those who know Khosrowshahi say he's the ""adult"" that Uber's corporate culture sorely needs. The Iranian American executive is also said to be a good deal maker. Expedia (EXPE) snapped up a series of travel-related businesses under his watch.  Related: Uber's new CEO will have to deal with Uber's old CEO It took Uber's board nearly 70 days to settle on a new CEO after the resignation of its co-founder and previous CEO Travis Kalanick. The short list of candidates included Jeff Immelt, the former CEO of General Electric (GE), and Meg Whitman, the head of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE, Tech30). Both tweeted they would not pursue the Uber CEO role. Immelt pulled out of the race Sunday because of problems with Uber's board, according to a source familiar with the matter. Whitman told the Financial Times on Monday that Uber had yet to resolve Kalanick's future role at the company and an explosive lawsuit about it.  Venture capital firm Benchmark, an early Uber investor, sued Kalanick this month in an effort to get him off the board. Among other allegations, Benchmark accused Kalanick of trying to ""acquire the power to pack the Board to facilitate his desired re-appointment as Uber's CEO."" Those close to Khosrowshahi say he has experience balancing strong personalities like Kalanick thanks to his many years working with Expedia chairman Barry Diller, a media mogul. Related: Who is Dara Khosrowshahi? In the Journal interview, Khosrowshahi described his relationship with Kalanick as ""budding."" And the former CEO was among the board members' names at the bottom of Tuesday evening's email to Uber staff. Khosrowshahi may still have sought assurances that the board wouldn't try to roadblock his every move. ""My viewpoint is they've given him that mandate,"" said Woody Marshall, a partner at Technology Crossover Ventures who grew up with Khosrowshahi. As Marshall put it, ""You can't have me go into a fight with one arm tied behind my back."" Related: Uber's CEO pick is an outspoken Trump critic There is urgency for Khosrowshahi to get to grips with the job as soon as he can. As the CEO search dragged on, Uber's problems continued to mount. Large Uber investors have marked down their investments. The startup lost $645 million in the three months ending in June. Its board is embroiled in a public legal fight. And its rivals abroad are raising billions and banding together. Uber said Khosrowshahi will ""be meeting with employees around the world in smaller groups over the next few weeks, and spending time with drivers."" -- Sara Ashley O'Brien contributed to this report."
"A widely-criticized location tracking feature debuted last year with an update to the app's permissions. It asked users to allow the app to always access their location, even when they weren't using it, including up to five minutes after a ride was completed. There was no option for tracking data only while using the app, a permission it had previously allowed. At the time, Uber said the change was for improved customer service and safety. Now that option is coming back. ""While our efforts last fall around post-trip location were aimed at improving the user experience, our riders let us know we missed the mark,"" a spokesperson for Uber said in a statement. ""We took this feedback seriously and have been working hard to make things right."" Related: Uber's CEO pick is an outspoken Trump critic Uber said the post-ride data collection is already suspended on iOS and Android, and was never turned on for iOS. The new privacy settings that let people limit location tracking to ""While Using"" will show up in the iOS app in the next few weeks. The company is still working on updating the privacy settings for Android. Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.), who has previously criticized Uber's privacy policies, applauded the on-demand taxi company's decision to let users have more control of their data. ""I'm glad to see that Uber has heeded my call and reinstated a customer's ability to limit the collection of location data to only when the app is actually in use and that the company has chosen to end post-trip tracking,"" the senator said in a statement. ""I'm hopeful that this announcement is the first step in Uber's renewed commitment to the privacy and security of its users."" The privacy update comes as the company is finally ending its tumultuous search for a chief executive. Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Expedia, is expected to take the job."
"As the CEO of Expedia (EXPE), Khosrowshahi has experience running an international travel company, not unlike Uber. He oversaw a publicly traded business making him a good fit to take Uber public. And those who know Khosrowshahi say he's the ""adult"" that Uber's corporate culture sorely needs. But if Khosrowshahi is well positioned to fix the many pressing issues that have plagued Uber throughout this year, he also has the potential to create a new one: getting in President Trump's crosshairs. Khosrowshahi gained widespread media attention this year for being a vocal opponent of Trump. Under his leadership, Expedia became one of the first in the tech industry to file a legal challenge to Trump's travel ban in January. Days later, Khosrowshahi ended an Expedia earnings call by saying, ""Hopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year."" Khosrowshahi's early opposition to Trump was driven both by Expedia's concern about political issues impacting the travel industry and his experience as an Iranian refugee. ""I said my part. I'm glad I did,"" Khosrowshahi told CNN Tech in an interview in April. ""It wasn't popular with everybody. It wasn't calculated. It was from the heart, and I think I represented the company well."" ""Now I can get back to work,"" he added. Khosrowshahi hasn't stopped criticizing Trump, though. Just this month, he went after Trump for his controversial remarks on neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups rallying in Charlottesville. ""I keep waiting for the moment when our Prez will rise to the expectations of his office and he fails, repeatedly,"" Khosrowshahi wrote in a post on Twitter. Related: Uber's new CEO will have to deal with Uber's old CEO ""Dara is not the type to seek headlines,"" says Hadi Partovi, a cousin of Khosrowshahi and an early Uber investor. ""But he also has the courage to stand for what's right."" This courage may win him support in Silicon Valley, where Trump supporters are hard to find. But there are nonetheless concerns that Khosrowshahi's political statements could be a liability for Uber. James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co, wrote in an investor note Monday that it's unclear ""how his outspokenness against the White House weighs on domestic regulatory hurdles."" Most of Uber's battles are on the city and state level, but the ride-hailing startup does come under federal scrutiny. Just this year, Uber has settled two complaints with the Federal Trade Commission. It is also reportedly facing a Department of Justice probe over a tool it built to help drivers dodge law enforcement. Travis Kalanick, Uber's previous CEO, initially served Trump's business advisory council and defended his role as being necessary to execute on Uber's mission. He dropped out of the council in February amid customer boycotts. Those close to Khosrowshahi say he can strike the right balance. ""Dara is extremely adept at dealing with sensitive situations,"" Partovi said. ""He's a technologist, but he's also a diplomat at the same time."""
"Ford and Domino's are testing out a specially-equipped Ford Fusion that comes not only with self-driving technology but also an oven. It sounds cool but there is a catch -- there's no one to walk the pizza to your front door and ring the bell. That's what Ford and Domino's say they're really testing. ""How will customers react to coming outside to get their food?"" Domino's president Russell Weiner said in a statement, ""We need to make sure the interface is clear and simple."" During the testing phase, an engineer and a driver will be in the car -- but the windows will be heavily tinted so customers can't see them. And both have been instructed not to interact with people at all. Domino's wants to see how well customers deal with coming out and getting their own pie from what is, basically, a pizza ATM built into the car. To get their pizzas, customers will have to enter a number on the touchpad, then a back window will lower, revealing the pizza. Over the next five weeks, randomly selected customers around Ann Arbor, Michigan, will be offered the option of getting their pizza delivered by the hi-tech ""driverless"" car.  During testing on public roads, the driver will operate the vehicle. Ford is testing self-driving cars on public roads in other places but this test is really about customer acceptance of the technology, a Ford spokesman said, not whether the car can drive itself. Roush Enterprises, a company that frequently works with Ford (F) on a specialty vehicles, created the built-in pizza oven for the Fusion delivery car. Roush previously helped create a specialized Domino's delivery vehicle based on a Chevrolet Spark. That car also had a built-in oven. Ford has been using Fusion sedans for some time to test self-driving technology. Experts have said that delivery services will likely be among the first industries to widely adopt self-driving vehicles. Ford and Domino's did preliminary testing for the human-free delivery process at Mcity, a simulated city environment on the campus of the University of Michigan. During testing on the college campus, the cars were allowed to drive themselves although humans were still were in the driver's seat."
"In ruling that privacy is a fundamental right, the country's Supreme Court singled out tech firms for gathering huge amounts of data: Facebook knows who we are friends with, the justices wrote, while Alibaba studies our shopping habits and Airbnb tracks our travel. ""This can have a stultifying effect on the expression of dissent and difference of opinion, which no democracy can afford,"" the court said last week. ""There is an unprecedented need for regulation regarding [how] such information can be stored, processed and used.""

""These companies must brace for [legal action],"" said Sunil Abraham, executive director of the Bangalore-based Centre for Internet and Society. ""Individuals who are unhappy with the treatment of their personal information can now take them to court, because it is an infringement of a fundamental right."" The UN Conference on Trade and Development said that while the United States, European Union, China and other nations have established similar protections, roughly 60 developing countries have no rules that govern how the tech industry should collect and use personal data. Activists say legal protections are needed to keep tech firms from irresponsibly harvesting data. Internet giants including Facebook and Google have built their business models around aggregating information about their users, and then marketing it to retailers. Some firms sell the data to third parties. The global battle lines are being drawn: The U.S. government recently asked the Supreme Court to compel Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) to hand over user data stored overseas, and the U.K. has proposed legislation that would allow users to ask platforms to delete their posts. The EU has taken several tech firms to task over privacy concerns. Related: Uber agrees to 20 years of privacy audits Now the debate is heating up in the world's largest democracy. Nikhil Pahwa, an internet activist and founder of tech website MediaNama, said the Indian court's ruling gives campaigners a major tool in the fight to keep data private. ""We've now been given a right which allows us to argue for our rights against practices of different companies,"" Pahwa said. The ruling could even cause problems for the Indian government, which is pushing its own controversial biometric ID card program. Nearly 1.2 billion people -- 92% of India's population -- have registered for the Aadhaar scheme, which links their fingerprints and iris scans to a unique 12-digit number. The program is designed to make welfare payments and medical services much more efficient. But skeptics have bristled at recent orders that seek to make the biometric ID mandatory when opening a bank account or filing taxes. ""I don't want an Aadhaar number,"" Pahwa said. ""I want to have the right to live in my country ... in a manner that I'm not being surveilled and watched."" Related: Internet censorship in India is on the rise Activists are also worried about how their data may be used and protected by third parties. Microsoft, for example, announced in July that it had integrated the biometric program with Skype Lite, a low-bandwidth version of the communications app made for the Indian market. ""If ... your fingerprints are your passwords -- and they're passwords that you can't change -- once they're gone they're gone forever,"" Pahwa said or potential data leaks.

The Expedia (EXPE) CEO said he will start at Uber on Tuesday. For Uber, Khosrowshahi's start can't come soon enough. It took Uber's board nearly 70 days to settle on a new CEO after the resignation of its co-founder and previous CEO Travis Kalanick. Kalanick was in attendance at the meeting.

Khosrowshahi also has experience running an international travel company, and oversaw a publicly traded business making him a good fit to take Uber public. Numerous Uber employees and investors tweeted their excitement over the new CEO. One former Uber executive described the vibe internally as ""strong optimism,"" but said a key concern lingers among employees: ""continued distraction from Travis."" Even as Khosrowshahi stood in front of employees, another Kalanick drama was unfolding.

""We recently discovered that one or more individuals obtained unlawful access to a number of high-profile Instagram users' contact information -- specifically email address and phone number¡ª by exploiting a bug in an Instagram API,"" an Instagram spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Tech. ""As always, we encourage people to be vigilant about the security of their account and exercise caution if they encounter any suspicious activity such as unrecognized incoming calls, texts and emails."" Instagram declined to say how many people had been targeted, and declined to comment on individual accounts. Earlier this week, entertainer Selena Gomez's Instagram account got hacked. Old photos of ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber were posted on her account. Phone numbers and emails are important personal identifiers, and potential hackers can find out a lot of information about people by investigating them. ""With an email address and a telephone number, it's not difficult to cross reference information online to find out more about a target, even a celebrity,"" said privacy expert Jessy Irwin. Someone could send the user phishing emails or texts to steal credentials and login to their accounts. It could also be possible for a hacker to steal someone's phone by hijacking their SIM card and gain access to other private accounts linked to the phone number. ""Because most accounts rely on phone numbers as a backup to get into an account or to grant access with a second factor, it would not be difficult for a criminal to break into an email account or to access phone backups, which are full of important information,"" Irwin said. Whether you're a celebrity or average user, it's always important to practice good security hygiene. Use hard to guess passwords, unique passwords on every account, two-factor authentication, and password managers to help keep track of your logins."
"Nest Labs is releasing a new version of its flagship smart thermostat with a new look and a big $80 price drop meant to appeal to regular folks. The Nest Thermostat E, launching Thursday, will cost $169 and feature a new vanilla design to help it blend into a home instead of stand out. The changes, while minor, are a notable departure from the Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30)-owned Nest Labs. Since launching six years ago, the Nest Learning Thermostat has won design awards and dominated the smart home market that it helped launch. But at $249, the device's price was too steep for many home owners, even with the promise of saving money on energy bills. A favorite of early tech adopters, the smooth wall-mounted disk was a conversation piece as much as a heating and cooling device. Now the company wants people to forget it's even there. The metal ring has been replaced with white polycarbonate plastic. The crisp LCD screen is covered with a frosted display that fades to light gray when not in use. There's less to see anyway, with a new minimalist look that removes tick marks and other details. When the motion sensor is triggered, the Nest will light up with large orange numbers showing the current temperature. Related: New Nest camera zooms in and recognizes faces The gadget still works with the same Nest app as its older iteration, so you can control it remotely through a phone or by yelling at an Echo or Google Home. While it does learn your heating and cooling habits over time, Nest isn't highlighting that feature. The Thermostat E will have an automatic schedule programmed in right of out the box, based on data Nest has collected over the years from all its users. It does not include a c-wire connector, which won't be an issue for most homes according to the company. To reach a wider audience, Nest is focusing on how a smart thermostat can save money. According to Nest's own studies, a smart thermostat can save users $131 to $145 a year. Different states and cities offer rebates to customers who switch to a smart thermostat, and in locations like Chicago, it can offset the entire cost of the Thermostat E. A thermostat was Nest's first product, and it's still the company's most successful original creation. The company has only created one other new product, the Nest Protect smoke and CO2 alarm. It also acquired wi-fi camera company Dropcam for $555 million, after which it redesigned and rebranded its products as Nest Cam. Its most recent release was an update to the indoor Nest Cam that added features like facial recognition. After a period of highly publicized drama, Nest Labs has been mostly quiet over the past year. Founded by former Apple executive Tony Fadell in 2011, the company was acquired by Google for $3.2 billion in 2014. After it snatched up Dropcam, the Dropcam CEO said he regretted the deal -- partially due to issues with Fadell's management style. Fadell resigned from Nest Labs in 2016. While a cheaper thermostat is not the flashy new product many Nest fans have been hoping for, it could be a lucrative move for the company. The low price and potential to save money on electricity bills could appeal to people who would not have considered the pricier Nest, which will still be available."
"On Tuesday, the FDA issued a recall for a number of implantable pacemakers manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, formerly St. Jude Medical. The recall says patients could be at risk of someone taking advantage of cybersecurity holes in vulnerable pacemakers. Now, 465,000 people in the U.S. with these implanted devices must visit their healthcare provider to receive a firmware update that can fix the vulnerabilities. About 280,000 devices are eligible for the update outside the U.S., Candace Steele Flippin, a spokesperson for Abbott said. The security flaws could allow a hacker to access the device and change the settings or shut it off. ""This access could be used to modify programming commands to the implanted pacemaker, which could result in patient harm from rapid battery depletion or administration of inappropriate pacing,"" the FDA wrote. There have been no incidents of hackers exploiting the flaw. One year ago, research firm Muddy Waters first said the St. Jude pacemakers were vulnerable to cyberattacks. Related: Hackable door locks? Senators want to make smart gadgets more secure In January, Abbott issued a security update for other vulnerable St. Jude cardiac devices connected to the Merlin@home Transmitter. ""These are part of planned updates we mentioned back in January, and further strengthen the security and device management tools for our connected cardiac rhythm management (CRM) devices,"" Steele Flippin said of this week's pacemaker update. Josh Corman, director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council and founder of the security organization I Am The Cavalry, said there are a lot of vulnerabilities in medical devices, and the research community is beginning to work more with manufacturers to identify and fix flaws. ""If we do find them, we could look at it as a reason not trust the devices, or we could look at it like we're going from a mode of silent failures to one where we're starting the process to inform smarter and better designs,"" Corman said. In May, cybersecurity researchers published a report highlighting thousands of vulnerabilities in four pacemaker manufacturers. Corman says people should not have a crisis of confidence that imperils future medical breakthroughs, despite the reality that nothing is unhackable. Instead, he says, it's important to determine what connectivity is actually needed, and balance it with acceptable risks. To help physicians better understand medical device security when procuring new technology, his organization created a document of questions doctors can ask to see if companies are doing enough to secure devices. ""I'm hoping that what device makers and physicians get out of this is we shouldn't just assume that connecting medical technology makes this better,"" Corman said."

The move signifies a major shift for the competitive and crowded voice assistant market, which also includes Apple's Siri (AAPL, Tech30) and Google Assistant (GOOG). Consumers may be more likely to adopt smart home products and corresponding voice assistants if they are able to work together. One of the biggest challenges the smart home industry currently faces is how many products are siloed. For example, some devices are only Apple HomeKit accessible, which means if you use an Amazon Echo, you'd have to switch to Siri to, say, dim the lights. Alexa and Cortana will be able to talk to each other starting later this year."

"The tech giant called on the Federal Communications Commission to ""retain strong, enforceable open internet protections"" in a public comment on the proposal to overhaul net neutrality protections. ""We work hard to build great products, and what consumers do with those tools is up to them ¡ª not Apple, and not broadband providers,"" Cynthia Hogan, VP of public policy at Apple, said in a comment filed to the FCC. The FCC voted in May to move forward with a proposal to roll back net neutrality protections put in place during the Obama administration. The rules are intended to prevent Internet providers from speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific websites. Apple's response was filed as part of a public commenting period on the proposal. The deadline for comments was Wednesday. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) highlighted the need for a continued ban on ""fast lanes,"" a term for Internet providers picking favorites by deliberately speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific online services. Related: Tech companies go big and small for net neutrality protest Otherwise, Apple warns, ""it could allow a broadband provider, not the consumer, to pick internet winners and losers, based on a broadband provider's priorities rather than the quality of the service."" Apple appeared to diverge from some net neutrality advocates on at least one key point: leaving the door slightly open to other enforcement options. As part of the 2015 net neutrality process, the FCC voted to assert more regulatory control over Internet providers by reclassifying them as common carriers, similar to telephone services. Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman appointed by President Trump, wants to repeal that reclassification. Net neutrality advocates say that renders any protections toothless. In its comment, Apple said it ""remains open to alternative sources of legal authority, but only if they provide for strong, enforceable, and legally sustainable protections, like those in place today."" Apple has been notably silent his year on the net neutrality issue. Dozens of tech companies staged an online protest last month to preserve net neutrality. The list included Facebook (FB, Tech30), Google (GOOGL, Tech30), Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) -- but not Apple."
"The printer, which made its first appearance at Crestwood Intermediate in rural Portage County, joined other pieces of new tech, like coding kits, robots and drones, offered at the school. The move is a part of the school's larger effort to build a ""makerspace,"" or space dedicated to creative learning through DIY projects. In a district struggling with budget cuts and the opioid epidemic, the tools -- donated by the Rural Technology Fund -- aim to create supportive space for children. Principal Michelle Gerbrick said the students -- who attend grades three through five -- are eager to test out modern technologies. ""We are educating them for jobs we don't know exist yet,"" Gerbick said. The Rural Technology Fund kickstarted the school's maker program last year when it donated 10 Makey Makey invention kits. Most recently, it contributed the 3D printer. Cybersecurity executive Chris Sanders founded the organization in 2008. His company, Applied Network Defense, funds the overhead for the nonprofit. It began as a scholarship program, but soon expanded its efforts by donating tech equipment. Since 2008, Sanders estimates the RTF has put tech resources into the hands of almost 40,000 kids in 40 states. This year, it's on track to help 25,000 students.  The foundation has also donated tech to school libraries, which Sanders says ""are increasingly becoming makerspaces."" Sanders grew up poor in Mayfield, Kentucky, and lost his mother when he was a teenager. Now, the 30-year-old wants to help children break the pattern of generational poverty. ""My dad was a truck driver and my mom was a sewing machine operator,"" said Sanders. ""That's really all I knew as a kid."" His story is not uncommon. In Mayfield, less than 15% of people over 25 have a Bachelor's degree or higher, and over 32% of the population live in poverty. Many rural communities still grapple with the loss of industries. For example, the Kentucky city relied on textiles and tire factories before those disappeared. ""Kids may decide to go into computer science and go to college to start their degree, but [could be] outpaced by everyone else who had earlier exposure to it."" Sanders said he was one of the few kids to get his hands on technology before college. His cousin, who was incarcerated for a drug charge, took a computing course in prison. He taught Sanders computing basics when he returned home.  Sanders began fixing the school's computers and later served as its IT specialist. After high school graduation, he was offered a job as his school's first network administrator, which paid part of his way through college. Sanders believes rural kids given access to tech resources and jobs could become just as successful as those in Silicon Valley, Sanders said. But there's another issue at play: Rural communities often lack broadband internet, so people can't get online at home for school or work. About 19 million people don't have access to broadband in the U.S., including nearly one-fourth of the population in rural areas, according to the FCC. Principal Gerbick said rural schools in Ohio are facing severe budget constraints. Proposals to increase taxes that support her district have failed twice. President Trump's budget proposal released in May includes a $9.2 billion spending cut to education. The RTF targets these underserved classrooms through DonorsChoose.org, a fundraising site for teachers, or direct requests. It gives teachers the hardware and knowledge needed to give kids hands-on tech training. Some students who benefited from the program now want to give back. Melissa Shankle, a 21-year-old computer science student at the University of Kentucky, received the Judith A. Sanders Memorial Scholarship from the Rural Technology Fund in 2014. She wants to create a scholarship in her own mother's memory to help future technologists. ""I knew that if there were more resources for students to get involved with technology, it would change the mindset from 'oh, that's cool' to 'I can and want to do that,'"" she said."
"The breakout droid star from ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is in for quite an adventure in the upcoming sequel, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" That is, if a new toy from robotics company Sphero is any indication. Sphero showed off on Thursday a first look at BB-9E -- BB-8's evil twin. In stark contrast to BB-8's cheery white and orange exterior, BB-9E's body is a menacing black and gray. The company worked with Disney, owner of the ""Star Wars"" franchise, to develop a mini toy version that realistically brings the movie character to life. The film is set to debut on December 15. ""We saw some imagery and [learned] how it sounds and behaves in the movie,"" said Sphero CEO Paul Berberian. The Boulder-based startup -- whose partnership with Disney began through a tech mentoring program -- created a robotic toy version of BB-8 in 2015, which sold more than million units. Like the BB-8 toy, BB-9E is also a 4.4-inch app-controlled robot. It has the same ball-shaped body that moves without wheels. It comes with a magnetically-attached head. It features blue and red lights that illuminate when the head is attached to the body. ""This is clever engineering,"" said Berberian. ""The lights are powered through induction when the head is connected to the body."" Related: 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' teaser trailer lands in our galaxy BB-9E features 40 sounds and nine commands controlled via the app such as ""patrol,"" ""run away"" and ""look around."" Meanwhile, Sphero's draw-and-drive function -- first created for BB-8 -- lets you program BB-9E to follow any pattern you draw via the app. After putting the toy on a base, you can explore the different ships of the ""Star Wars"" galaxy through an augmented reality experience on your mobile device. The BB-9E toy ($149) will go on sale midnight Friday, along with a mini robotic version of R2-D2 ($179). Toys and other merchandise tied to new movie will go on sale Friday after midnight -- an event that has been dubbed Force Friday. For inspiration, Berberian said the company purchased every R2-D2 toy it could find and found ""not one could behave and move as the character did in the movie."" Related: 'Star Wars: Episode IX' gets summer 2019 release date But Sphero's R2-D2 design can pull a third leg up into its body, waddle and fall down and play dead, just like the character in the movie. ""We want to think of [our products] as droids come to life; not just toys,"" Berberian said. The BB-8, BB-9E and R2-D2 toys are designed to interact with the movie itself. When the film is playing, the droids make noise and interact with each other. ""Through sound, BB-9E shows it is happy when the bad guys win and BB-8 becomes sad,"" he said. Related: Disney reveals plans for 'Star Wars' immersive hotel This isn't the first time Sphero has worked closely with Disney. In 2014, the startup participated in a three-month Disney accelerator. During that time, Sphero was handpicked by Disney CEO Bob Iger to make the toy version of BB-8. ""[Iger] knew us and immediately pulled out his iPhone and showed us photos from the Star Wars set and BB-8,"" Berberian said. ""He asked if we could make it come to life."" Sphero was already working on the next iteration of its app-controlled robotic ball, which closely resembled BB-8. The Sphero ball was the company's first product, and it sold 800,000 units. But the company said it will be a producing a much smaller quantity of BB-9E. ""We're not going to be able to make any more, even if there's a lot of demand for it,"" said Berberian, adding that the move was a deliberate decision. ""Typically good characters tend to be more popular than evil ones,"" he said. ""We're [also] not making as many because we want to keep the mystique of [BB-9E]."""
"Apple (AAPL, Tech30) will hold its annual product launch -- where it typically shows off new iPhone models and other product updates -- on Tuesday September 12. For the first time, the event will be held at the spaceship-shaped Steve Jobs Theater on its new Cupertino, California headquarters, expected to open later this year. This year is expected to be a big one for Apple, since 2017 marks the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone. Rumors indicate the company will introduce three new devices at the event: the iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus and the so-called iPhone 8, which will be the 10th anniversary edition. The iPhone 7S line is expected to feature incremental updates, but the anniversary phone could get a whole new look. Related: Fitbit tries to catch up to the Apple Watch Apple CEO Tim Cook was recently photographed with a taller iPhone in his pocket, which lines up with rumors that it'll come with a 5.8 inch display. To put that into perspective, the iPhone 7 is 4.7 inches and the iPhone 7 Plus is 5.5 inches. The anniversary device is also expected to include an OLED display that has richer colors, wireless charging, a virtual home button and facial recognition technology. There's lot of speculation about its price, too, which could start at $1,200 -- twice the cost of an unlocked iPhone 7. Apple is also expected to reveal its first cellular Apple Watch and a 4K Apple TV set-top box at the event. Although the launch event is slated for September, it may take a while for customers to get their hands on a new iPhone. Some analysts believe the anniversary device could be in short supply, citing ""constrained supplies."""
"But the emergency number struggled with record high call volume. At the peak of the storm, the service received around 80,000 calls in a 24-hour period. The Harris County area typically gets around 8,000 calls a day. Some people were unable to get through at all, and those who did were put on hold while a recording -- which promised the call was being processed -- looped. Desperate residents took to social media to post their addresses in the hopes that someone would get the information to the right authorities or a friend with boat. The requests went viral, leaving many wondering why 911 wasn't able to do more. Like most 911 systems in the U.S., Houston's is based on outdated telephone network technology. There are 30 centers fielding 911 calls in greater Harris Country, where Houston is located. The emergency network is the largest 911 operation in Texas and one of the largest in the country. It is more advanced than many ¡ª the centers can receive SMS text messages --- but it needs an overhaul to keep up with the smartphone age. There is a plan in place to update systems across the country to something called Next Generation 911, which works over internet-based networks. It would make it possible to outsource 911 calls during a disaster like Harvey, and make it easier to process rich texts and better pinpoint locations. Related: How social media is helping Houston deal with Harvey floods Inside the Houston Emergency Center, call takers took turns pulling 12-hour shifts and sleeping in the building during the hurricane. Many employees worked in spite of their own personal emergencies. There was no other option. Rerouting calls to 911 centers outside the system is not technically possible because of the legacy telephone technology. ""Moving calls around is really a physical [task],"" said Trey Forgety, directory of government affairs at NENA, the National Emergency Number Association. ""You have to go physically move wires, and it's nearly impossible to do it during a disaster."" Next Generation 911 systems would make it easy to quickly shift calls to other counties. It could also change how people communicate with 911 during a disaster. Texting makes sense during a disaster when hold times are long and battery power is a precious resource. The greater Harris Country system received around 630 SMS texts this past week, up from 115 the week before. But Joe Laud, administration manager for the Houston Emergency Center, said they prefer calls because it takes ten times longer to respond to a text. Under the Next Generation system, people would be able to text photos, videos and other files to 911 instead of just words. Eventually the centers could hire video and photo analysts and text messaging specialists to process the requests. Some of the issues 911 centers faced during Harvey are harder to solve. But the use of social media was an unexpected complication. Each tweet or Facebook post that was widely shared resulted in a high number of calls to 911 about the exact same, often outdated, cry for help. ""I'm still getting emails for high water rescues, but now we're finding out they're all duplicates,"" said Laud. ""It's hard to coordinate anything, especially in the social media world."" The hope is that increased capacity for calls and other forms of communication will reduce the number of people posting publicly. That's preferable to trying to add social media monitoring. ""We're very conscious of the need to protect consumer privacy,"" said Forgety. ""We don't want to be in the business of surveillance. It's a bit of a fraught area for us."" Related: Businesses donate over $113 million to Harvey relief efforts They also don't want to be in the business of coordinating with amateur rescuers. Harvey saw an influx of civilian responders ¡ª people using their own boats, gear and smartphone apps to help people. ""Citizen responders in some ways are a great asset for our nation to have,"" Forgety said. ""On the other hand, when they're not necessarily properly trained and properly insured, it's really difficult for the emergency response community to engage with them."" For now the industry is focused on less technical issues, like funding. The first stage of the switch to Next Generation 911 is expected to happen in 2020. It will take between $10 billion and $12 billion to update all the 911 systems in the country, according to NENA. The vast majority of 911 funding is done on the state and local level, though there is a pending federal grant program that could contribute $150 million. Until 911 catches up to the technology on our smartphones, people can help call centers by following a few rules. Only call in case of an emergency, don't hang up and call again, and update your social media posts if you've already been rescued. ""I think everyone's got the message,"" said Laud. ""Stay on the line and save 911 for true emergencies."""
"Juicero, a startup that was widely ridiculed for selling an absurdly overpriced juice machine, is shutting down. The news was announced on its website Friday. The company had raised about $120 million in funding from multiple prominent investors, including Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins. Juicero's stated goal was to change how we consume fresh, organic foods. Or, as the founder Doug Evans, put it in one interview last year: ""Not all juice is equal. How do you measure life force? How do you measure chi?"" But the farm-to-glass startup quickly became a laughing stock -- and a sticky symbol for Silicon Valley being out of touch with the rest of the country. Related: Why everyone's laughing at this $400 juicer In April, Bloomberg revealed customers can get the same result by squeezing the startup's juice packs with their bare hands as with the machine. That came as a shock to some of Juicero's investors. Juicero CEO Jeff Dunn argued the product still provided value to customers by making life easier. ""The value of Juicero is more than a glass of cold-pressed juice,"" he wrote in response to the report. ""Much more."" But Juicero still felt the squeeze. The business was reportedly trying to get the price of Juicero down to about $200. It had previously lowered the price from $700 to $400 in January. In the end, it simply ran out of juice. ""We began identifying ways that we could source, manufacture and distribute at a lower cost to consumers,"" the startup said on Friday. But it determined the infrastructure required for this effort was something ""we cannot achieve on our own as a standalone business."" Juicero is offering refunds until December 1."
"But then an ad appears, offering a free ride to a new Thai spot on the other side of town. Suddenly, you're reconsidering plans: Why pay for a ride to one neighborhood when another is totally free? Ultimately, your favorite restaurant could lose a customer. Scenarios like this may play out in the coming era of self-driving vehicles. The cost of offering fully autonomous rides could be so low that businesses will be tempted to subsidize the rides to boost their bottom line. According to experts, the move could have big implications not only for businesses but for cities, public transportation systems and car owners. ""There's an infinite number of new advertising modes that become possible,"" said Hod Lipson, a Columbia University engineering professor and author of the book ""Driverless: Intelligent Cars and the Road Ahead."" ""We'll see a lot of innovation."" In some cases, Uber and Lyft rides are already priced so low that they're competitive with public transportation systems. With self-driving vehicles, costs will be even lower. After all, there will be no driver to pay. Ultimately, public transportation systems could be undercut. Research from investment firm Ark Invest has estimated autonomous taxis will cost $0.35 per mile. Rides today typically run a few dollars for each mile. According to Ark Invest analyst Tasha Keeney, someone taking a shared ride in a self-driving vehicle could experience even cheaper rides. But some riders may not see a point in riding with strangers if it's only saving them 5% on an already low fare, Keeney added. This could result in a traffic nightmare. Urban designer Jeff Speck warned low-occupancy vehicles are a tremendous waste of street space. Replacing trains and buses with autonomous vehicles could cripple mobility. As a result, city planners may need to determine how to manage a major influx of self-driving vehicles. Automakers may also see a decline in sales as customers may see fewer reasons to buy a car. Related: Your car's data may soon be more valuable than the car itself Free transportation might seem like a wildly revolutionary idea, but there are already examples today, such as airport shuttle buses. ""The psychological appeal of zero [cost] is so strong; any time you can offer a free transportation service, like a corporate shuttle, you almost certainly will,"" Chris Anderson, author of ""Free: The Future of a Radical Price,"" told CNN. In the book, he argues businesses can benefit more from giving things away than charging for them. For example, a free ride service on golf carts called Sprynt launched in a section of Arlington, Virginia this summer. The neighborhood is full of restaurants and affluent young people, making it a good fit for an ad supported business model. Sprynt founder Alex Villanueva has placed iPads in front of his passengers. The business was inspired by free ride services in Florida and California that operate along popular commercial strips. The big question is just how far free or nearly free self-driving rides will reach. Niche services such as Sprynt won't get you everywhere you need to go. Car data is so lucrative that Ben Volkow -- CEO of otonomo, an Israeli startup that sells vehicle data -- expects automakers to more money selling data than vehicles by 2020. If the money made off self-driving vehicle data outweighs the costs of offering rides, then it becomes reasonable for a business to offer free rides broadly. Related: Domino's testing self-driving pizza delivery Anderson cautions that it's premature to think about how a business model around self-driving taxis could function and how the future will play out. There are still technical hurdles to developing the vehicles, and questions around liability and regulations. ""Whether people will go to Uber, or bikes, a reinvented public transportation or air taxis, I'm not sure,"" Anderson said. ""But the notion of the three-car garage is clearly going away."""
"But it appears the bug was exploited before Instagram's fix, and affected more than the most high-profile accounts. On Friday, Instagram CTO Mike Krieger published a blog post alerting all users to the security flaw. ""Although we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted, we believe it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts. We want to reiterate that no passwords were exposed in this issue,"" the company said in a statement. A spokesperson told CNN Tech they are aware individuals are trying to sell the information, and the company is working with law enforcement. Hackers are selling email and phone number data allegedly belonging to Instagram accounts that they say they scraped before the flaw was fixed. People can look for usernames on a searchable database and buy personalized data for $10 each. The website can't be accessed by traditional web browsers. A manager of the database told CNN Tech that ""we have a variety of high profile accounts, normal accounts, and very high profile celebrities."" Related: Instagram alerts high-profile users their data may have been accessed The hackers claim to have personal information associated with over 6 million accounts. The manager of the database said he heard about the Instagram vulnerability on a private chat room, and accessed the data on August 25. This person sent CNN Tech a list a list of 1,000 purported Instagram accounts and associated data, and CNN Tech was able to confirm that some of the emails included were used by existing Instagram accounts. Facebook, which owns Instagram, declined to comment on Friday. Earlier this week, entertainer Selena Gomez's Instagram account was hacked and old photos of ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber were posted to her account. Hackers can use phone numbers and emails to find out a lot about a person. For example, an attacker could take over a phone by hijacking its SIM card and gain access to accounts associated with the phone number."
"The pledge from the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation is the largest contribution to date. It follows a long list of corporate donations to help the storm's victims and aid with recovery. The founder and CEO of Dell and his wife Susan on Friday also announced the launch of the Rebuild Texas Fund, along with Texas Governor Greg Abbott. The pair has already donated $17 million to launch the fund. The goal is to raise more than $100 million for immediate relief efforts, as well as longer-term recovery and rebuilding. ""This disaster is personal to everyone who has roots in Texas,"" Michael and Susan Dell said in a statement. ""Both of us were born and raised in Texas, and the street Michael grew up on in Houston is under water now."" Related: Businesses donate over $113 million to Harvey relief efforts The foundation will also match $1 for every $2 donated to the new fund for the first $36 million raised. The matching campaign starts on Friday and will continue through midnight on Monday. Corporate giants have contributed $113 million to disaster relief efforts as of Thursday, according to the most recent estimate from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Fifty-two companies had donated $1 million or more as of that time. These figures are constantly growing as pledges continue to pour in. Walmart (WMT) pledged up to $20 million in cash, products and matching donations. Meanwhile, Verizon (VZ, Tech30) contributed $10 million."
"Fisher was one of six astronauts on the International Space Station. He looked down on his hometown of Houston -- headquarters for NASA's human spaceflight operations -- as Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc on the Gulf Coast. ""Harvey fills the window creating a path of destruction as it traverses the Gulf. Praying for the people there and hoping for sunshine,"" Fisher wrote on social media from aboard the ISS Wednesday. On Saturday, Fisher, along with fellow NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson and one Russian cosmonaut, returned to Earth. The Americans then began the trek back to a water-logged Houston. Getting the astronauts on solid ground was the next great challenge for a small team of NASA flight controllers who have been hunkered down at Johnson Space Center in Houston for days. The flight controllers have been living at the NASA complex, riding out Harvey and providing critical support to the crew on board the space station. It's because of that ground-based team that astronauts were able to get updates on their families as Harvey pounded the city. The center took ""significant"" damage, the agency said. At least two facilities at the space center experienced flooding and water damage, but the Mission Control Center remained operational. JSC experienced significant flooding during storm. MCC remains operational. Sonny Carter Training Facility and video and photo lab affected. pic.twitter.com/MZUtm3svro The team there was able to keep things running relatively smoothly, despite Harvey, but their day to day life was anything but normal. About 13 cots lined the walls of the complex. Staff caught naps between shifts. Flight director Royce Renfrew posted pictures on social media of the beds. A sign outside the makeshift bunk room reads, ""SLEEPING QUARTERS shhh..."" Some additional pics from inside Mission Control Houston. Very proud of these teams! Flight Operations #CanDo #Harvey #HoustonStrong pic.twitter.com/vakdae8QCv ""It takes an incredibly professional group of individuals to come in and sit down and fly the space station for nine hours, or some people had to take 13 hour shifts,"" NASA flight director Zeb Scoville told CNN. ""Then they had to turn around, wake up and do it over again."" Scoville, who is leading the ground-based team, said everyone is still dressed in business wear. It maintains ""a level of respect"" for the history of flight controllers before them, Scoville said. Fisher and Whitson, along with Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin, departed the space station Saturday in a capsule and touched down Kazakhstan around 9:30 p.m. ET. Fisher and Whitson will travel to Germany, and from there the astronauts will board a plane to Houston. The final leg of their trip will happen a bit later than initially scheduled because of damage to Ellington Airport airport, a NASA and U.S. military flight hub, an agency spokesperson said. Whitson -- a seasoned astronaut who owns the record for the most cumulative time a NASA astronaut has ever spent in space -- had to cancel her final press conference aboard the space station because of the storm. She shared her thoughts on returning to a storm-ravaged city in messages posted to NASA.com. ""Our home is fine, but so many friends and co-workers have been impacted,"" she said. However, ""any trepidations I might have about returning in the aftermath of a hurricane are entirely eclipsed by all those folks keeping our mission going and physically putting themselves out there to help folks who were less fortunate than us."" In addition to the crew members holed up at the space center, various NASA workers have phoned in from home to lend more help. They did this, ""all the while worrying about the Sheetrock that needed to be torn out of their flooded house,"" Whitson said. Scoville, the flight director, said, ""It doesn't matter what your job or title is. This affects a program manager, an astronaut, or a flight director just as well...and they've all been affected and have to deal with the destruction."" But despite it all, Scoville added, morale is high. ""They're going to keep [the space station ] flying,"" he said. The crew even has its own mission patch to commemorate their efforts to keep Johnson Space Center up and running in spite of Harvey. Its tagline is ""ad astra per aqua."" It means, ""to the stars, through water."""
"Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX's CEO wasn't making doomsday predictions because North Korea is testing nuclear weapons. What's got Musk much more worried about world war is artificial intelligence. North Korea ""should be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk,"" Musk said in one of a series of posts on Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) early Monday. ""Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo,"" Musk said in another tweet, using the Internet short-hand for ""in my opinion.""

Musk has tried to address his AI anxieties through two new ventures: OpenAI, a non-profit AI research company, and Neuralink, a startup building devices to connect the human brain with computers. ""I was trying to really sound the alarm on the AI front for quite a while, but it was clearly having no impact,"" he said in one interview around the launch of Neuralink.

"""The decision to end DACA is not just wrong,"" the Facebook (FB, Tech30) CEO wrote Tuesday about the dissolution of a program that protect undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.

""This is a sad day for our country."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the program, which protects nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants (often called Dreamers), ""is being rescinded."" Congress now has six months to come up with a legislative fix. The repeal effort has worsened what was already a tense relationship between President Trump and the business community.

Other top tech execs were quick to criticize the decision, too. ""Dreamers are our neighbors, our friends and our co-workers,"" Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google (GOOGL, Tech30), said in a Twitter post. ""This is their home. Congress needs to act now to #DefendDACA."" Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer at Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), wrote in a blog post that the company is ""deeply disappointed by the administration's decision today."" Silicon Valley has clashed with the Trump administration on a range of issues this year, including the decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement and withdrawing protections for transgender students. But Trump's immigration policies, including the travel bans, have been a particular lightning rod in an industry where many big companies and startups were founded by, and are still staffed with, immigrants. Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted Sunday that the company has 250 Dreamers on staff. Microsoft says it currently has 39 Dreamers, and a source close to IBM (IBM, Tech30) says it has at least 30.

"Nissan (NSANF) on Tuesday night unveiled a brand new version of its Leaf, the best-selling electric car in the world. It's the first complete redesign of the car since it was first introduced in 2010. The Leaf was a pioneering mass-market electric vehicle. But the current model's driving range has left it lagging the Bolt in sales in the U.S. lately, according to figures from Kelley Blue Book. The Leaf has an estimated range of 107 miles, less than half the Bolt's 238 miles or the Model 3's 220 miles. With 150 miles on a single charge, the new Leaf still doesn't match the range of either of those cars, but it does beat them on price. Its starting price in the U.S. will be under $30,000, which is even cheaper than the current Leaf. The Bolt and Model 3 both start at over $35,000. That lower cost -- plus the car's new design and some high-tech features -- could make buyers willing to pass up on the extra miles of range they may rarely need. In the U.S., most drivers travel less than 50 miles on a typical day. In Japan, where the new Leaf will go on sale first, Nissan executives estimate that most drivers will only need to charge the car once a week. Related: Tesla delivers first Model 3 cars Among the new features on the redesigned car are Nissan's ProPilot, a semi-autonomous driving and parking system that's similar to Tesla's (TSLA) AutoPilot. The new Leaf will also have have single-pedal driving capability, a major feature of GM's (GM) Bolt.  With this feature activated, drivers can accelerate, decelerate and even hold the car in place on a hill by simply pressing and releasing the accelerator pedal. The driver hardly ever needs to use the brake pedal in most normal driving situations. Related: Driving the Chevy Bolt EV From the outside, the car has a lower, wider and more tapered design compared with the generally rounder current model. Nissan also promises improved acceleration and driving performance thanks, in part, to the car's wider stance, lower center of gravity and 147 horsepower. That's considerably more than the 107 horsepower in the current version.  The new Leaf goes on sale in Japan on October 10, but U.S. drivers will have to wait until ""early 2018"" to get their hands on it, Nissan says. The automaker plans to offer a higher-powered version for the 2019 model year that will also provide longer driving range."
"That ambitious idea has caught the attention of China's Tencent (TCEHY), the lead investor in a $90 million fundraising round announced Tuesday by startup Lilium. The German firm, which successfully tested a prototype two-seater jet in April, said it will use the money to add to its 70 staff and develop a larger five-seat jet that can take off and land vertically. Founded by four students from the Technical University of Munich in 2015, Lilium has recently hired executives with experience at Airbus (EADSF), Rolls Royce (RYCEF) and Tesla (TSLA).  The company's next design project is an air taxi that can travel at speeds of up to 300 km/hour (186 mph). Powered by 36 engines, it would carry five passengers up to 300 km (186 miles) while producing zero emissions. ""This is the next stage in our rapid evolution from an idea to the production of a commercially successful aircraft that will revolutionize the way we travel in and around the world's cities,"" CEO Daniel Wiegand said Tuesday.  The company's latest fund raising round included Obvious Ventures, which is backed by Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) co-founder Ev Williams, Liechtenstein's LGT Group and Skype co-founder Niklas Zennstr?m's investment firm Atomico.  Several firms, including Aeromobil and Terrafugia, are developing vehicles that look more like tiny planes than cars. Many rely on drone technology and vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, eliminating the need for a runway. Kitty Hawk, a startup backed by Google (GOOGL, Tech30) co-founder Larry Page, unveiled its prototype ""ultralight"" aircraft in April."
"Taxify launched its ride-hailing app in London on Tuesday, offering half price fares and no surge pricing until the end of the month. Once the initial discounts end, Taxify still aims to be 10% cheaper than Uber, CEO Markus Villig told CNNMoney. ""I think we mainly have a very strong second mover advantage,"" Villig said. ""We don't need to do the hard work of actually establishing this market. We can rather come in, be more efficient, more lean and take a smaller cut for ourselves, and therefore undercut the existing incumbents."" Its launch in the British capital comes as Uber is struggling to recover from a series of damaging scandals that resulted in its former CEO being forced out by investors. The new arrival appeared to be drawing plenty of interest: Taxify was top of the trending list in Apple's App Store in the U.K. on Tuesday morning. Related: As Uber stumbles, rivals mobilize abroad But even though Taxify said it had ""thousands of drivers signed up"" ahead of the launch, its service appeared to be lagging Uber in some central London locations early Tuesday, with longer waits for rides. ""In this early stage, this is normal and we are expecting more drivers to come online within the following hours,"" a Taxify spokeswoman said. ""In the longer term, we are aiming to offer our customers the shortest waiting times."" Wait times were already competitive in some places, such as near the Royal Opera House, she added.  Taxify is entering a crammed marketplace. Other apps such as Gett and MyTaxi already jostle with more traditional cab firms for business in London. Taxify started operations in Estonia in 2013. It says it takes less commission from drivers than Uber and other rivals, enabling it to charge customers lower fares. Its London launch coincides with the official first day on the job for Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, who was picked to help the world's most valuable startup bounce back from months of crisis. Related: New Uber CEO tells staff company 'has to change'  Taxify says it already has more than 2.5 million customers across 19 countries in Europe, Central America and Africa. It's planning to launch in Paris before the end of 2017. ""We see that in the long term, actually taking a smaller cut and having happier drivers will really lead to a sustainable business,"" Villig said, adding that the firm had been profitable over the past 12 months. And he has powerful friends. Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing service that beat Uber out of the world's most populous nation, said last month it was investing in Taxify and would help it grow. The partnership is just one of several Didi has established with Uber rivals around the world, including in the U.S., India and Southeast Asia. Didi, whose backers include Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and major Chinese tech firms, is pressing ahead with the tie-ups despite its financial links to Uber. Related: China's Uber worth $50 billion after raising more cash Didi's deal to buy Uber's China business resulted in the U.S. company receiving a roughly 18% stake in the Chinese firm. And Didi ended up with a stake in Uber. A Didi spokeswoman played down the potential conflicts of the company's web of links to Uber and its rivals around the world, saying there was ""ample room"" for multiple operators in the rapidly developing market. ""Eventually, drivers and riders, and cities looking for solutions to their congestion and efficiency problems, will benefit from robust investments into the industry from different players,"" she said. Uber said millions of Londoners were using its app and waiting less than three minutes on average for a ride. ""Competition is a good thing as it raises service levels across the board,"" an Uber spokesperson said. -- Samuel Burke and Mark Thompson contributed to this report."
"Irma, a Category 5 storm with winds of 180 mph, was about 100 miles north of the Dominican Republic. Some forecasts suggest it could reach the Kennedy Space Center by late Saturday or early Sunday morning. The weather at the cape was calm and clear Thursday morning. ""If you looked outside you would not know a hurricane is expected,"" SpaceX spokesman John Taylor said, earlier Thursday morning. ""It's a typical sunny Florida morning."" Within minutes of the launch, the first stage of the Dragon rocket landed back at the Kennedy Space Center as planned. The ability to land its first stage for reuse is a key to its efforts to cut the cost of space flight. It launched from launch pad 39A, which NASA had once used for Apollo moon missions and many Space Shuttle missions. Related: Elon Musk predicts World War III threat Not much is known about the Air Force's new unmanned space plane, the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, that SpaceX launched. It launches vertically on a rocket but lands on a runway much like an airplane. It's part of the Department of Defense's Rapid Capabilities Office, which works on technology to combat urgent national security threats. The plane is carrying ""experimental payloads,"" according to the Air Force. Specifically, it is has equipment to test ""experimental electronics and oscillating heat pipes"" during long trips in space. Heat pipes can be used on satellites to help regulate their temperature in space. Related: SpaceX just teased a chic new spacesuit This is the fifth flight for the X-37B. The fourth flight was launched in May 2015 by United Launch Alliance, a SpaceX rival that is a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). That plane orbited the earth for 718 days before landing in May 2017. SpaceX had to fight for the chance to break up United Launch Alliance's monopoly and land lucrative military contracts. That started in 2014, when SpaceX sued the government, saying the Air Force wasn't giving SpaceX fair consideration when it awarded contracts. The suit was eventually settled, and SpaceX completed its first mission for the Air Force in 2015. The company has also signed two separate deals -- valued at a combined total of $183.7 million -- over the past two years to launch GPS satellites into orbit for the Air Force."
"The company said its diesel ban would take effect at the end of 2019. It will only allow hybrid and fully electric cars on its standard UberX service from the same date. The move comes amid a growing diesel backlash in Europe, where Britain and France have already announced plans to end sales of new gas and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040. The policy shifts have been motivated by concerns over climate change and pollution caused by dirty engines. London exceeded the European Union's annual limit for nitrogen dioxide exposure just five days into the new year in 2017. King's College, meanwhile, estimates that air pollution is responsible for 9,400 premature deaths in the city each year. Mayor Sadiq Khan has made cleaner air one of his top priorities. He has announced new ""ultra low emission zones"" that will be in place by September 2020. All vehicles entering the inner London will have to meet strict emission standards, or pay a special fee. Related: London is trying to solve its pollution problem The city is also offering taxi drivers grants worth as much as ?5,000 ($6,600) if they upgrade to cleaner vehicles. Uber said Friday that it would match the city's offer and allow drivers to claim up to ?5,000 ($6,600) towards an upgrade. The deep-pocketed startup said it would kickstart the ?150 million ($198 million) fund next month with an initial ?2 million ($2.6 million) investment. Related: These countries want to ditch gas and diesel cars But London users will be charged an additional ?0.35 ($0.46) per ride to help fund the scheme. Just under half of all vehicles on the app in London are already hybrid or electric. Uber said that every vehicle should be electric by 2025. At least one analyst questioned Uber's intentions. ""Uber is on a charm offensive ahead of a likely IPO,"" said John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School. ""They have to start somewhere with attempting to counter the continuing bad publicity occasioned by further announcements of more litigation,"" he said."
"The House of Representatives passed the Self Drive Act unanimously Wednesday. The bill addresses a lingering question over how the federal government and states will regulate self-driving vehicles. Traditionally, the federal government has regulated vehicle safety, and states have handled vehicle operations, such as issuing driver licenses. But with a fully autonomous vehicle, the car becomes the driver, disrupting how regulation has long worked. Automakers and tech companies have warned of a potential patchwork of rules, where 50 states deliver 50 different sets of rules for self-driving vehicles. This would hamper the ease and pace at which autonomous technology is rolled out, likely slowing the expected safety benefits. The AFL-CIO, which represents transportation workers who will be affected by the technology, cautioned Wednesday about rushing the technology out. It called for more deliberation and input on the impact of driverless vehicles on jobs and wages. Autonomous vehicles are expected to disrupt the work of millions who drive for a living. Related: How free self-driving car rides could change everything The House bill exempts a limited number of self-driving cars from federal rules. Initially, 25,000 self-driving vehicles will be allowed. The cap would gradually grow to 100,000 after three years. Automakers would first have to prove to NHTSA that their vehicles are safe. States would generally be pushed to the side. A number of state associations expressed concerns in a letter Tuesday that the bill expands federal pre-emptions, and limits their role in regulating vehicle operations. But these issues haven't held up the bill in the House. Related: Your car's data may soon be more valuable than the car itself Autonomous vehicle regulation remains a hot topic with many moving parts. A separate autonomous vehicle bill is in the works in the U.S. Senate, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is reportedly announcing updated self-driving guidelines next week. Automakers and tech companies are spending billions to develop technology that is expected to be worth trillions. Many have announced plans to make self-driving vehicles available in 2020. Today, there are some limited pilots of self-driving vehicles happening in the United States and other countries such as a Singapore."
"Facebook (FB, Tech30) has claimed that its advertising platform can reach millions more young adults in the U.S. than are estimated to actually live in the country, according to Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. Facebook's Ads Manager claims to have a potential reach of 41 million people in the U.S. between the ages of 18-24, according to Wieser's investor note released Tuesday. But the U.S. Census Bureau estimates there were only 31 million people in that age range last year. Likewise, Weiser found Facebook claimed advertisers could potentially reach 60 million 25-34 year-olds in the U.S., substantially more than the census estimate of 45 million residents in that age group. Facebook says its reach estimates factor in location data, which could include non-residents visiting the U.S., and age information, which is self-reported by the user and may not match government data. Related: Facebook's global fight against fake news ""They are designed to estimate how many people in a given area are eligible to see an ad a business might run,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNN Tech. ""They are not designed to match population or census estimates."" The discrepancy between Facebook's numbers and census estimates risks further unnerving marketers after the company faced a series of issues with its ad metrics. Last year, Facebook admitted to miscalculating the average time users spend watching videos and the number of completed video views. It also ""over-reported"" average time spent on Instant Articles, the company said. In May, the social network offered refunds after a ""bug"" caused some advertisers to be billed incorrectly when users clicked on videos in a carousel ad unit. ""While Facebook's measurement issues won't necessarily deter advertisers from spending money with Facebook, they will help traditional TV sellers justify existing budget shares,"" Wieser wrote in his investor note."

Zuckerberg repeated his earlier condemnation of Trump's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which allowed recipients known as ""Dreamers"" to live, work and study in the U.S. without fear of deportation. Congress now has six months to develop a legislative solution. ""To offer the American Dream to people, and then to take it away and punish people for trusting their government and coming out of the shadows ... is one of the most troubling things I think I've seen a long time in our country,"" he said. In a Facebook post Tuesday, he called the move ""particularly cruel."" Related: Mark Zuckerberg slams DACA repeal Trump's Justice Department rescinded DACA on Tuesday, saying it amounted to constitutional overreach by the Obama administration, which implemented it. Zuckerberg acknowledged the complexities of immigration policy, but said he believes DACA is ""the most clear cut"" of all immigration issues. He then gave the Dreamers present time to share their individual stories. Two -- Leezia Dhalla and Maria Praeli -- work for FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization that Zuckerberg founded alongside other tech leaders. The third person featured, Tomas Evangelista, works at the California-based Latino Leadership Council. Zuckerberg did not talk about any Facebook employees that may be affected or plans to support these individuals. Facebook declined to comment about any Dreamers it employs. Zuckerberg encouraged his millions of Facebook followers to have a sense of ""urgency"" and to petition Congress to take action. ""What I think really needs to happen is the majority of people need to say, 'Hey, this is not only something that I want to see happen, but is something that needs to happen now,'"" he said. ""Because if it doesn't happen, then people's lives are going to be put at risk."" He mentioned that Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) came out on Tuesday and said Congress should prioritize legislation to preserve DACA over tax reform, an issue around which the business community has been rallying. Zuckerberg did not say specifically whether Facebook plans to lobby for the same approach, but said he recognized the need to make ""trade offs."" ""It would be just a massive setback -- both morally, socially and economically -- if we fail to deliver on this,"" he said.

"Do you buy an 8 or wait? It's a difference of $200 to $300, six long weeks and the ability to animate yourself as a cartoon poop. You have to dig through a lot of superlatives and made-up marketing terms (Bionic chip, Super Retina, deeper pixels) to find what's really new in the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. To help you decide when (or if) you should spend hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone, let's look at what each device offers. Real talk: Do you even need a new phone? Next week, the day before the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus ship, Apple will release its iOS 11 mobile operating system. The free update will introduce a new design and add a number of new features to existing phones. There's support for augmented reality apps, a file management system, an updated Control Center and a safety feature for drivers. Siri's voice has even been tweaked and can do new tricks like translations. The catch? iOS 11 is only available if you have an iPhone 5S or later, and not every new feature will work on all models. For example, person-to-person payments only work on the iPhone SE and later; Augmented reality will only work on iPhone 6S and newer. You might be happy upgrading to the water-resistant iPhone 7. It shares a number of specs with the newer models but will now sport a new, lower price tag starting at $549. What you get with the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus They could have easily been called the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. The two new models include a few standout features, subtle design changes, and the usual host of speed updates. The back of the phones are now a piece of reinforced glass. Why the switch? It's necessary for the biggest new feature found in the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus: ""wireless"" charging. Instead of inserting a lighting connector into the port on the iPhone, you can place the device on top of special inductive charging pads (sold separately) that use the Qi charging standard. Related: Apple's iPhone X: Face ID, no home button, $999 All three new phones will have a faster A11 processor. The A11 includes a ""neural engine"" for handling complex tasks like speech recognition and, on the iPhone X, facial recognition. What's different from the iPhone 7: The iPhone 8s have inductive charging, a glass back, faster processors and are available in larger 64 GB or 256 GB options. Apple says the camera sensors are larger and better at low-light photos. The iPhone 8 Plus's dual cameras mean it gets a handful of new Portrait Mode options, which mimic professional lighting effects. It adds more frame rate options and an improved flash. What's the same as the iPhone 7: The basic design of the phone is the same and unlikely to stand out unless you spend a lot of time staring at the backside of your device. Battery life, screen resolution and the water and dust resistance are all the same as the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Cost and availability: The iPhone 8 starts at $699 and the iPhone 8 Plus at $799 for 64GB. Preorders begin Friday, Sept. 15, and the phones will ship Sept. 22. What you get with the iPhone X There is some undeniably cool (and possibly creepy) new technology packed into the iPhone X. Available in only one size, it's slightly larger than an iPhone 8. The iPhone X packs in a much larger 5.8-inch display by pushing it all the way to the edges of the phone and killing the home button. The splashiest addition is face detection. Instead of using a fingerprint, the phone will use front-facing sensors and cameras to identify your face and unlock the phone. The technology will also be used for other features, like Animoji, which animate emoji like a panda, unicorn or poop so they mimic your facial expressions. The camera has a couple of improvements over the iPhone 8 Plus. The dual lenses are now stacked instead of side-by-side, and the telephoto lens has a wider ?/2.4 aperture. Both lenses have optical image stabilization, versus just one camera on the iPhone 8 Plus. What's different from the iPhone 8: The iPhone X has facial mapping and detection features for unlocking and Animoji. The higher resolution screen goes closer to the edges, except around a cut-out on top of the device for sensors. There is no home button and no fingerprint sensor. The camera is a step up, with optical image stabilization on both back lenses. The front camera has Portrait Mode. What's the same as the iPhone 8: The iPhone X also has inductive charging, a glass back, and the faster A11 processor. It has the same Portrait Mode camera features on the back camera. Cost and availability: The iPhone X starts at $999. The phones will ship Nov. 3."
"23andMe, a genetics testing startup, announced on Tuesday it banked a $250 million funding round from Sequoia Capital. The Silicon Valley venture capitalist firm has backed companies like Google (GOOG), Instagram, and Airbnb. The company is most known for collecting the spit of customers in exchange for information about their genetic history, health, and physical traits based on their DNA. In addition to helping consumers learn more about themselves, the company leverages that data for disease research and developing drug therapies. The team is currently running research programs dedicated to a range of areas, like oncology, skin, and cardiovascular disease. It is leveraging its data to help academic and pharmaceutical partners develop new therapies for diseases like Parkinson's, irritable bowel syndrome, and lupus. The new funds will be used to fuel its therapy development, as well as marketing and growing its user base, according to a source familiar with the matter. ""We have only begun to scratch the surface in direct-to-consumer genetics,"" said CEO and founder Anne Wojcicki in statement. The company, founded in 2006, is now a household name. In July, its DNA ancestry tests were one of the hottest items to sell on Amazon Prime Day. But its history hasn't all been rosy. Related: Doggie DNA startup gets fresh funds In November 2013, the FDA ordered it to stop issuing health guidance to its consumers, saying it couldn't prove that its test results were accurate. It kept its business afloat by scaling back tests and delivering consumers with raw data and ancestry information -- not analysis. In October 2015, it received FDA approval to tell customers whether they are carriers of certain disease-causing genes, which could be passed on to their children. Meanwhile, the company earlier this year got clearance to issue genetics reports on 10 additional diseases, like Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and coeliac disease. The company is the first and only to receive FDA authorization for over-the-counter genetic health risk reports. Related: New genetic test wants to help women get pregnant So far, 23andMe has genotyped 2 million customers around the world. About 85% of its customers have consented to participate in its genetic research since it launched its research program in 2008. According to Nikhil Krishnan, tech industry analyst at CB Insights, there's reason to believe 23andMe is just scratching the surface. ""Sequoia joining the company's cap table and board for the first time indicates they see a significant amount of growth still ahead for the company,"" Krishnan said. Although $250 million is the company's largest round to date, there have been other ""mega"" financing rounds in the genetics space. For example, GRAIL raised more than $900 million in March and Guardant Health raised $360 million in May. Both are working on blood-based cancer detection."
"The company on Tuesday said its NES Classic Edition will start shipping again in 2018 due to strong demand. When the company announced earlier this year it was pumping the breaks on the console, gamers were not happy. After all, it one of the most sought items during the 2016 holiday shopping season -- and also one of the most difficult to find. Nintendo attributed the decision to stop production to ""limited resources."" But now it appears the company is rethinking its strategy. The console ($60) touts 30 built-in games, including ""Mario Bros."" and ""Donkey Kong,"" and a retro-inspired controller.  Related: Super Nintendo gets the miniature console treatment The announcement of its return came just two weeks before the company will launch its second miniature-sized console: the SNES Classic Edition ($80). It features 21 built-in games like ""Super Mario World"" and ""The Legend of Zelda."" It will also include a new title, ""Star Fox 2."" Pre-orders for the SNES are already sold out online at Amazon, GameStop and Target. But Nintendo (NTDOF) promises it will be easier to get your hands on this one. The company said it will ship more units of the Super NES Classic Edition on its U.S. launch day, September 29, than all of last year with the NES Classic Edition. ""Fans have shown their unbridled enthusiasm for these Classic Edition systems, so Nintendo is working to put many more of them on store shelves,"" the company said in a statement. The company isn't just banking on nostalgic consoles to drum up excitement and bring in sales. In March, Nintendo launched its latest gaming system -- the Nintendo Switch -- which works as both a TV-linked console and a handheld portable device. In its most recent quarter, the company sold 1.97 million Switch consoles."
"The world's biggest smartphone maker is aiming to release a device with a foldable display in 2018, its head of mobile Koh Dong-jin said in Seoul on Tuesday. Koh added that the company still has ""hurdles to overcome"" before making the phones a reality. ""We are digging thoroughly into several issues,"" he said, without elaborating. Rumors of a foldable phone have been swirling around Samsung (SSNLF) ever since the company showcased a flexible display at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2013. It has already incorporated elements of the technology in its curved Galaxy Edge smartphones, and one industry analyst described Samsung's goal of releasing a foldable device next year as ""quite realistic."" ""It's been known that Samsung has been working on the foldable display for many years,"" said IHS Market analyst Jusy Hong. A little-known Chinese startup called Moxi said in May 2016 it would launch wraparound black-and-white phones made of graphene by the end the year. There have been no signs since of those phones actually hitting the market. Samsung says it is on track to produce a full-fledged folding smartphone. ""Foldable phones are on our roadmap,"" Koh said Tuesday. Will apps catch up? One challenge Samsung might face is getting developers to tailor their applications to the new folding screens. ""What makes smartphones smarter is applications, especially third-party applications,"" Hong said. ""If you have a foldable phone but most of your applications are not supporting foldable features... it would be meaningless."" Successfully launching a folding smartphone would bolster a remarkable turnaround for Samsung's Galaxy Note series, which took a huge hit last year when Note 7 phones began bursting into flames. Samsung had to recall millions of devices and lost billions of dollars in the process. But the latest model in the series, the Note 8, appears to have shaken off the concerns that dogged its predecessor. Samsung has already received around 650,000 pre-orders for the new device ahead of its launch on Friday, Koh was reported as saying. -- Jo Shelley and Taehoon Lee in Seoul contributed to this report"
"It has no home button, scans your face to log you in and costs $999. The company unveiled the anniversary edition smartphone, alongside an iPhone 8 and its bigger sibling, the iPhone 8 Plus, at a press event at the brand new Apple Park campus in Cupertino on Tuesday. The company also announced a new Apple Watch with a cellular connection, an Apple TV that streams 4K video, and gave the public its first peek at the circular Steve Jobs Theater. iPhone X To introduce the iPhone X, Apple CEO Tim Cook uttered the classic line at the annual press conference: ""One more thing."" ""We have great respect for these words and don't use them lightly,"" said Cook, adding the new phone would set the path for technology for the next decade. The new iPhone X kills the home button to make space for a larger screen. It has an edge-to-edge display, glass on the front and back, wireless charging that requires resting the phone on a special surface, and a surgical grade stainless steel band around the edges. It's water and dust resistant. The 5.8-inch OLED display isn't just bigger, it also packs 458 pixels-per-inch. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) calls it a Super Retina Display. It supports HDR, has a million-to-one contrast ratio and improved color accuracy. Related: Apple teases the future of augmented reality apps The loss of the home button means no more fingerprint sensor. To unlock the phone, you can use your face with a new technology called Face ID. Front-facing cameras and sensors create a map of your face to determine if you are the phone's proper owner. The technology learns more about your face every time you use it, and stores any face detection information on the device. It uses small flood light to work in the dark. Apple said face detection is more secure than fingerprints. It added there was a one in 50,000 chance of a random person being able to open your phone with their fingerprint. But those chances drop to 1 in a million with face detection. The company also introduced a Face ID-enabled feature called Animoji, which serves up animated emoji that mimic your facial expressions. For example, you'll be able to give your friends side-eye as a unicorn. How the new animoji feature will work with Face ID on the iPhone X (it turns your facial expressions into something you can share) pic.twitter.com/HXxbQ5cgzO Apple spent a significant amount of time hyping up its 12-megapixel dual cameras with image stabilization. Schiller said the new front facing cameras will ""revolutionize"" selfies by adding portrait mode. Related: Don't faint: The iPhone X could cost $1,000 The iPhone X will cost $999 for the 64 GB version, $1,149 for the 256 GB version, and start shipping on Nov. 3 -- more than a month later than all the other devices announced on Tuesday. iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus For those not willing to shell out a grand for a new smartphone, the iPhone 8 options are cheaper and also pack a powerful punch. They're faster, sturdier and better at snapping photos than the previous iPhone. On the surface, the devices look similar to the iPhone 7. The iPhone 8 clocks in at 4.7 inches and iPhone 8 Plus is 5.5 inches. But inside is an A11 ""bionic chip"" and an improved camera sensor. There are new camera modes, including an expanded Portrait Mode that lets you change lighting effects after you take the shot. The company also teased some of the new features coming to iOS 11, including augmented reality. Wireless charging, available on both the iPhone X and iPhone 8 devices, is a big move forward, too. The charging requires contact between a special surface and the glass back of the iPhone. The technology is based on Qi wireless charging, which Apple believes will be available at coffee shops, stores and airports around the world in the near future, so people can get juice on the go. iPhone 8 smartphones, which come with an aluminum band around the edges, will be available in three colors: space gray, gold and silver. The iPhone 8 will start at $699 and the iPhone 8 Plus is $799 for 64 GB models. Apple Watch Series 3 Apple also announced a new cellular Apple Watch, which Cook claimed was the best-selling watch in the world, though the company has declined to release sales numbers. The waterproof Apple Watch has an even greater focus on fitness and health. For example, it flags users when it detects an elevated pulse. The Series 3 comes with a built-in cellular connection, so it no longer needs an iPhone nearby for most tasks. You can answer calls, receive text messages, talk to Siri, check maps and use third-party apps over cellular connections. Starting in October, it will also be able to stream music to Air Pods over cellular. To demonstrate the watch's new powers, Apple conducted a live phone call from stage with a person on a paddle board in the middle of a lake. Siri can finally talk back on the new watch, thanks to a new dual-core processor. Also included is a barometric altimeter, which tracks activity like stair climbing, skiing and snowboarding. The company has bigger dreams for the watch than workouts and wrist calls. It's launching an Apple Heart Study later this year that will be able to detect early signs of atrial fibrillation, one of the leading causes of stroke. The watch will cost $329 without cellular, and $399 with cellular. It works with all four major carriers in the U.S., though Apple did not mention details on plan pricing. The watch will be available on Sept. 22. Apple TV 4K The company also teased a new Apple TV ($149) with support for 4K video streaming and a revamped the user interface. Its graphics are four times as fast, according to Apple. Apple said it is working with studios and streaming companies like Netflix to add more 4K content. It will also launch on Sept. 22. Apple Park campus The Apple Watch was the first product unveiled inside the circular Steve Jobs Theater, part of Apple's brand new multi-billion dollar headquarters in Cupertino, California. The spaceship-shaped campus is expected to open later this year. The event opened with a short inspirational video with featured audio by late Apple founder Steve Jobs. ""It seems only fitting that Steve should open his theater,"" Cook told attendees. ""Steve meant so much to me and so much to all of us. There's not a day that goes by that we don't think about him. Memories especially come rushing back as we prepared for today and this event."" "
"If you live elsewhere, you'll have to pay even more. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) charges different prices for its devices from country to country, depending in part on taxes and how each local currency compares with the U.S. dollar. Related: Yup, it costs $999. But you'll pay it. In some countries, like Canada and Japan, the iPhone X costs about $100 more than it does in the U.S. In other nations, like Italy and Ireland, the phone is over $400 more expensive than it is in the States. Apple analyst Gene Munster of Loup Ventures said that iPhones tend to cost between $50 and $300 more internationally. But higher prices won't necessarily deter global shoppers from buying a new iPhone. ""It usually isn't a deal-breaker,"" he said. He thinks that will be especially true with the futuristic iPhoneX, which looks so different from other models. Related: Apple's iPhone X: Face ID, no home button, $999 Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research, pointed out that it's hard to compare prices across countries not only because they include currency conversions and local taxes, but because the device's true cost also depends on the average resident's income.  With that in mind, here's how much the iPhone X costs in 15 countries, according to Apple's website. The prices were converted to U.S. dollars using Google's currency calculator. Australia: $1,266 Canada: $1,082 China: $1,285 France: $1,387 Germany: $1,375 Hong Kong: $1,099 India: $1,391 Ireland: $1,410 Italy: $1,423 Japan: $1,024 Mexico: $1,325 New Zealand: $1,311 Russia: $1,387 Singapore: $1,224 United Kingdom: $1,327"
"In fact, you could lean back and relax before you even get home. Once you're there, just keep on relaxing while the car takes you straight into your living room. That's the idea behind a concept car called the Symbioz, just revealed by French automaker Renault. The electric car provides both extra seating space and, if needed, feeds extra power from its batteries to the home at which it is parked. The car and its house were both unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Batteries in the Symbioz are stored flat in its floor, maximizing interior space in the generally boxy concept car. It would be capable of driving itself and the front seats can fully rotate. That way all the occupants can interact face-to-face even when the car is out on the road. When it arrives at the owner's home -- in this case, a color-coordinated concept house -- the car just drives right in, becoming part of the living room. It can then be lifted up in an elevator to become a second-floor lounge area with a view of the stars through its panoramic sunroof. ""No longer can we think of car design in isolation from the ecosystem surrounding us,"" Renault's lead designer Laurens van den Acker, said in a statement. ""Renault Symbioz truly is a unique project that allowed us to work with planners, designers, engineers and architects. "" A look Renault's other recent concept cars The car's batteries can be charged by plugging into the house's electrical system. During a blackout, or during times of peak electrical demand, the car can also act as a back-up battery, feeding electricity back into the home. That's something that can be done with electric cars today. For now, the Symbioz is just a concept car -- and a concept house designed to work with it. But Renault promises that a drivable car, with many of the elements seen in the Symbioz, will be ready for testing before the end of this year. The car represents Renault's ""mid-term vision"" and includes various technology features that will be available to customers in the next few years, the automaker says. Those include an improved version of Renault's Multi-Sense for customizable interior lighting and driving as well as new assisted driving features. None of the planned production car features, at this point, seem to include a house, however. Renault (RNLSY) is part of the Renault Nissan (NSANF) Alliance."
"The German automaker said it will spend more than 50 billion ($60 billion) on battery cells as it pushes to electrify all 300 models in its range by 2030. Volkswagen described the purchase as ""one of the largest procurement"" programs in automotive history, signaling it is accelerating the shift to electrified vehicles after its diesel emissions scandal. ""We have got the message and we will deliver. This is not some vague declaration of intent,"" said CEO Matthias M¨¹ller. ""The transformation in our industry is unstoppable."" Volkswagen (VLKAY), which owns the Audi, Skoda, SEAT and Porsche brands, will continue to invest in improving its gas and diesel engines while bringing 80 new electrified models to market by 2025, including 50 purely battery-powered vehicles. It estimates that around 25% of its new vehicles -- up to 3 million a year depending on market developments -- could be purely battery-powered in 2025. Achieving that will require a huge number of batteries. The German firm estimates it will need more than 150 gigawatt hours of battery capacity annually by 2025. That's more than four times larger than the annual output of the enormous battery production ""Gigafactory"" that Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has built in the Nevada desert. Related: German automakers confront a diesel rebellion in their own backyard Volkswagen admitted in 2015 that it had been cheating on diesel emissions tests after its vehicles in the U.S. were found to be emitting up to 40 times the legal limit on nitrogen oxide. Since then, the company has faced intense pressure to offer cleaner vehicles. China, the world's largest car market, announced this week that it intends to ban the production and sale of vehicles powered only by fossil fuels. India, France, Britain and Norway also want to ditch gas and diesel cars. In Germany, where the auto industry employs 800,000 people, Chancellor Angela Merkel has hinted that it's only a matter of time before the government sets its own expiration date.  Related: These countries want to ditch gas and diesel cars Volkswagen said its new investments would set the scene for ""e-mobility's final breakthrough."" ""Then it is up to customers to decide how fast it will gain widespread acceptance,"" said M¨¹ller."
"The gift of $7 million to San Francisco public schools and $5.2 million to Oakland public schools brings the total amount of money invested in the two school districts by Salesforce to nearly $35 million over the past five years. In addition to funds that pay for things like teacher training and classroom math coaches, some of education donations come with very few strings attached. That's by design. Five years ago, Salesforce began giving middle school principals $100,000 of unrestricted funds to use as they see fit as part of its Principal's Innovation Fund. ""They know what's going on on the ground,"" said Ebony Frelix Senior Vice President of Philanthropy & Engagement. ""By giving them money that is not allocated by the district, you allow them to innovate and do what's best in the school."" The company, which is based in the San Francisco, expanded donations to the Oakland Unified School District in 2016, and included a number of the $100,000 grants. When the group checked back at the end of the year to see how the money was used, it saw that a large portion was going to support immigrants and refugees who have been in the U.S. for less than three years. Many of the students are unaccompanied minors who fled violence back come. The company is also including funds specifically earmarked to support immigrant and refugee students at the district level. The donations also pay for teacher training, tutoring and math coaches in the classrooms. The chief goal for the multi-million dollar education donations is a drive to fund computer-science education. With this donation, Salesforce plans to do more measurement and evaluation to better understand the impact of its funds. In addition to money, Salesforce employees are committing to volunteer for 40,000 at the schools. When the program started, there were 200 girls taking computer science classes in San Francisco public schools. Now there are 3,800. There's been a similar jump in enrollment among underrepresented groups, according to Salesforce. In Oakland, the number of kids enrolled in computer science courses has gone from 80 to 900. Of those kids, 29% are African American and 38% are Latino. Related: Salesforce just spent another $3 million to close its pay gap Salesforce.org is trying to get other tech companies more involved in public schools as well, though Salesforce is not alone in giving back. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Dr. Priscilla Chan pledged to donate $120 million to Bay Area schools starting in 2014."
"The social media platform promised Wednesday to keep ads off content and videos that feature graphic images, nudity, violence or adult language. It also said that users who repeatedly post fake news may not be allowed to make money on the site. The new rules should help assure companies that their ads will not appear alongside objectionable material. But it also puts Facebook in the position of deciding whether specific pages and videos are offensive. The move could help Facebook (FB, Tech30) to avoid problems that have plagued its cross-town digital ad rival. Google (GOOGL, Tech30) came under pressure earlier this year when major brands discovered their ads were shown alongside YouTube videos made by extremists. AT&T (T, Tech30), Verizon (VZ, Tech30), Walmart (WMT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) were among the firms that temporarily pulled their ads off the video platform. The rules published by Facebook on Wednesday prohibit ads from running on content that features ""fights, gore and beatings of either animals or people."" Content deemed to be ""incendiary, inflammatory and demeaning"" or that depicts ""blood, open wounds, bodily fluids, surgeries, medical procedures or gore"" will not be monetized. Related: Inside the fake news machine The regulations should help undercut the business model of those who publish sensationalist headlines and what Facebook describes as ""false news,"" though it will not solve the problem entirely, especially because many of those people use Facebook not for ad revenue but to drive traffic to their sites, on which they sell ads. The company has cracked down on fake news publishers in the wake of the 2016 presidential election, when huge volumes of misleading information was peddled on the site. In late August, the company said that users who repeatedly share fake news would be prohibited from running their own ads on the site. Related: Facebook says it sold ads to Russian 'troll farm' during 2016 campaign Google and Facebook own huge chunks of the digital advertising business, and major brands are spending an increasing share of their ad budgets on their platforms. But as advertisers direct more dollars to digital, many are demanding proof that the ads are translating into sales, and are growing wary of the content to which their ads are connected. WPP (WPPGF), the world's largest advertising company, warned last month that the transition from traditional ads to digital is not going smoothly. ""The digital marketplace has been dogged by issues such as measurability, viewability, fraud, and fake news,"" the company said in its earnings report."
"Criminals can use your Social Security number to steal your identity. They can open bank accounts and credit cards or apply for a loan. Hackers can also get ahold of your tax refund or get medical treatment under your name. In recent years, SSNs were exposed when fraudsters hacked the U.S. Postal Service, a hospital network and Anthem health insurance. The data breaches beg the question: Why are we still using Social Security numbers to identify ourselves? Social Security numbers were first issued in 1936 -- ""for the sole purpose"" of tracking the earnings history of workers for benefits, according to the Social Security Administration. Until 1972, the bottom of the card said: ""FOR SOCIAL SECURITY PURPOSES -- NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION."" But Social Security numbers have since become a key method of ID. ""It was the one unique piece of information that would identify every consumer individually,"" Neal O'Farrell, executive director of the Identity Theft Council, told CNN Tech. Related: The biggest data breaches ever So if not Social Security numbers, what are the alternatives? A national identification number is one idea that's been floated. However, this would be a huge undertaking for the U.S. government -- and that number could get hacked as well, according to experts. ""It doesn't matter if it's a new Social Security number or a new national identification system -- whatever that identifier is, it's still going to be the thing that attackers are going after,"" said Russel Van Tuyl, managing consultant of security assessments at Sword & Shield Enterprise Security. Biometric identifiers -- such as fingerprints, iris scans, voice and facial recognition -- are potential alternatives. The technology has become more mainstream in recent years: We regularly use our fingerprints to unlock our smartphones. Meanwhile, iris scans and facial recognition are also available on some phones, and many consumers talk to voice assistants like Alexa and Siri. ""Biometrics is much more viable than it was five to 10 years ago because of mobile,"" said Justin Oberman, a former Transportation Security Administration executive and former VP of identity strategy at SureID. ""If everyone was using fingerprints, no one would care about Social Security numbers anymore ... [But] all of this is going to take time,"" he said. Related: What to do if your identity is stolen Some companies -- and countries -- are already using biometrics like voice for identification. For example, the global bank HSBC launched a security technology called Voice ID last year. Customers who use banking services over the phone can register their voice with the company. The technology analyzes more than 100 behavioral and physical voice characteristics to identify and authenticate the customer. It's available in English, Spanish, Cantonese and Mandarin. Meanwhile, Australia's Department of Human Services and Taxation Office allows people to create a ""voiceprint"" to identify themselves when they call. The U.K.'s tax and customs authority also introduced tech this year that recognizes a person's voice over the phone. Related: Equifax leaves Canadian and British victims in the dark But a disadvantage of biometrics is that if this information is compromised, you can't replace it. ""If someone hacks your account and takes your password or username, you can just get rid of it and get another one. You can't do that with your finger or your eyeball,"" Van Tuyl said. And you can also get a new Social Security number -- if you can prove you're being harassed, being abused or in grave danger, or that someone stole your number and is using it. Although you can't replace your biometrics, sophisticated tech called ""anti-spoofing"" can detect whether someone is using them fraudulently, such as playing a computer simulation of your voice, according to Brett Beranek, director of strategy and go-to-market for biometrics and security at Nuance. For its part, HSBC said its Voice ID technology is advanced enough to determine if someone is pretending to be you or playing a recording. It can also recognize your voice even if you are sick or have a sore throat. As for whether we should get rid of the Social Security number as a form of ID, Beranek said: ""The number can stay, but we shouldn't rely on it to prove who you are. ... You should just assume anybody could have that number."""
"Analysts say the axed channels provided vital information that helped them follow the movements of Kim Jong Un, advances in North Korea's weapons programs and other important developments. ""Basically, this hurts efforts to track activities of interest in a closed country -- at the worst possible time,"" tweeted Joshua Pollack, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. Tensions between North Korea and the U.S. have spiked this year as Kim's regime advanced its nuclear weapons program and President Trump responded with fiery rhetoric. Hey, @Google / @YouTube. We have a problem. Please restore North Korea-related channels ASAP. They're primary sources for researchers.  The shuttered YouTube channels played clips from state TV and other North Korean content. One channel run by Uriminzokkiri, a North Korean government propaganda website, had racked up millions of views. It was ""terminated due to a legal complaint,"" according to a short message posted by YouTube. Videos published on Uriminzokkiri's channel have made headlines around the world, including one in 2013 that appeared to show an imagined missile attack on U.S. government buildings in Washington. North Korea analysts have studied all kinds of footage put out by the channels, searching for clues about missiles and other military hardware. The videos also help them understand what the North Korean regime is telling its people -- and what messages it might be trying to send to foreign governments. ""These North Korean videos are ... indispensable sources of information for us on the outside,"" Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an open letter Tuesday to Google (GOOGL, Tech30), YouTube's parent company. Melvin told CNNMoney that the closure of Uriminzokkiri and a second channel -- Tonpomail -- represented a ""serious loss."" Tonpomail was controlled by ethnic Koreans in Japan who are loyal to Pyongyang, he said. Related: North Korea is trying to amass a bitcoin war chest YouTube declined to give a full explanation for taking down the accounts. ""We love that YouTube is a powerful platform for documenting events and shining light on dark corners around the world, but we must comply with the law,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We disable accounts that repeatedly violate our community guidelines or terms of service and when we are required by law to do so."" The researchers pointed out that the channels didn't carry ads so they weren't making money for the North Korean regime, which has been hit with waves of international sanctions aiming to cut off its sources of income.  Melvin suggested YouTube's actions could be the result of a U.S. executive order targeting the property of persons identified by the Treasury Department as having links to the North Korean government. ""If Google closed the YouTube accounts under this provision, then this is a case of regulations being written so broadly that they hit and destroy assets that are actually important to the U.S. policy community,"" he wrote. This isn't the first time YouTube has killed channels related to the North Korean government. It closed down a state TV account in November, which was reported to have been making money from advertising. Related: Will the latest U.N. sanctions make Kim Jong Un sweat? YouTube's actions in recent days have added to the confusion. It initially suspended Uriminzokkiri and several other channels on Friday, saying they had violated ""community guidelines."" Then it reinstated them over the weekend before taking some of them down again Tuesday. North Korean propaganda footage is still available on other YouTube channels -- and on Chinese video sites like Youku. But the loss of a major source such as Uriminzokkiri still has consequences for experts. ""Even if the proprietors of the channels find other outlets, crucial research archives are now gone,"" Pollack said. -- Sara Ashley O'Brien contributed to this report."
"On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) unveiled new smartwatches, an Apple TV and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus at a press event. But the showstopper was a premium device called iPhone X, with a starting price of $999. While the 8 and 8 Plus resemble existing iPhone models, with a few new features thrown in, the X is a more radical overhaul. It has an all-glass design, an edge-to-edge display, and the option to unlock with facial recognition. Apple is touting the iPhone X as nothing short of ""the future."" The stakes could not be higher for Apple to make sure X lives up to the hype. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) hasn't refreshed the look and feel of its iPhone line since 2014, cutting into demand for what has long been its main moneymaker. Apple's annual sales declined in 2016 for the first time since 2001. Sales fell again in the beginning of this year following the rumors about the big tenth anniversary iPhone launch. After Apple's press event, a number of Apple analysts said they believe X may mark the sweet spot. Related: 10 things you need to know about iPhone X ""In our view, Apple took the iPhone franchise to a whole new level with the iPhone X, pushing the company deep into the ultra-luxury smartphone market,"" Brian White, an analyst Drexel Hamilton, wrote in an investor note Wednesday. Gene Munster, a top analyst now with Loup Ventures, said the new technologies included with the iPhone X ""solidify the platform on which Apple will retain and grow its user base for the next decade."" The iPhone X has a new camera system that enables the facial recognition option and can be used to power animated emojis with your facial expressions. The phone also replaces the home button with new swipe gestures. And like the 8 and 8 Plus, the X will have wireless charging. Industry watchers are unfazed by the four-figure price tag. The assumption, according to William Blair analyst Anil Doradla, is consumers are more willing to ""pay up"" for a premium iPhone now because of their ""increasing dependence on smartphones and the role they play"" in our daily lives. Instead, the chief concern about the iPhone X is the timing. Related: Apple's iPhone X: Face ID, no home button, $999  Apple said the iPhone X won't start shipping to customers until November 3, more than a month later than the other new iPhone models and later than Wall Street had expected. Amit Daryanani, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, says the delay ""could partially shift"" some of the expected surge in iPhone sales into early next year. Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal echoed the concern in a note, but said the delay ""may not matter"" for Apple's iPhone sales when viewed over the course of the 2018 fiscal year given anticipated strong demand. A more fundamental concern may simply be whether Apple can churn out enough of the high-end devices to meet that demand. ""Supply of iPhone X will be the single-biggest challenge for the next few quarters,"" Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie, wrote in another note."
"A new startup called Bodega launched Wednesday and has already apologized in the face of mounting outrage. Folks weren't happy that Bodega appeared to be taking aim at mom-and-pop shops run by hardworking immigrants, while simultaneously misappropriating immigrant culture and celebrating gentrification. ""Despite our best intentions and our admiration for traditional bodegas, we clearly hit a nerve this morning,"" Bodega wrote in a Medium post. ""And we apologize to anyone we've offended. Rather than disrespect to traditional corner stores -- or worse yet, a threat -- we intended only admiration."" The company's concept isn't novel: Position pantry boxes stocked with non-perishable, convenience store items in locations that shoppers frequent -- like gyms and dorms and a buildings -- by striking deals with property managers. Users can unlock the box with an app and they'll be charged for whatever the cameras record them taking. Its logo is a cat -- a nod to the animal that so often takes up residence at a traditional corner store. The company, founded by Paul McDonald and Ashwath Rajan, was profiled in a Fast Company article titled ""Two Ex-Googlers Want To Make Bodegas And Mom-And-Pop Corner Stores Obsolete"" that quickly went viral on Wednesday. Related: Startup behind ridiculed $400 juicer shuts down In the article, McDonald said he was ""not particularly concerned"" about the startup coming off as culturally insensitive.

It's a simple name and I think it works,"" cofounder Paul McDonald told the magazine. On Wednesday afternoon, he conceded that ""... it's clear that we may not have been asking the right questions of the right people."" McDonald says he doesn't want to put the mom-and-pop shops out of business. ""We want to build a shopping experience that stands for convenience and ubiquity for people who don't have easy access to a corner store,"" he wrote, apologizing to anyone offended. ""We commit to reviewing the feedback and understanding the reactions from today. Our goal is to build a longterm, durable, thoughtful business and we want to make sure our name -- among other decisions we make -- reflects those values."" The tech industry has been pilloried for forcing gentrification in major cities like San Francisco. Longtime natives have criticized the industry for driving up rents and destroying the city's character. ""Weird that they're calling this heinous vending machine 'Bodega' and not 'Gentrification Box,'"" tweeted one person.

"The chances of someone else unlocking your iPhone are one in a million with Face ID, Apple's SVP of marketing, Phil Schiller, said at a Tuesday event. With Touch ID there is a one in 50,000 chance it will be opened with the wrong fingerprint. Apple did not disclose where these figures are from. Here's how Face ID works: Front-facing cameras and sensors map your face to determine if you are actually the owner of the phone. The tech learns more about your face each time it is used. So for example, it will recognize you even if you grow a beard or put on glasses. It will also work in the dark. Related: 10 things you need to know about iPhone X While biometric identification, such as facial recognition and fingerprint sensors, can be more convenient than a passcode, it raises important questions about privacy and security, such as how this data is stored and whether the tech can be tricked. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) said facial information is protected by its ""secure enclave"" to keep data ""extremely secure."" The processing is done entirely on the device and not in the cloud in an effort to protect a user's privacy. Fingerprint information is also encrypted and stored securely. Apple declined to provide further details.  Face ID also requires a person's attention, so users must have their eyes open and be looking at the device for it to work. This could, for example, prevent someone from opening the device using your face when you're sleeping. Apple also says Face ID is designed to prevent spoofing attempts by a photo or a mask. Facial recognition in the past has been tricked with a photo, such as with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. While we won't know if the iPhone X will be fooled until it's shipped in November, experts believe Face ID will be more difficult to hack than other systems. ""It goes well beyond the Galaxy Note, though it definitely isn't un-spoofable,"" Brian Brackeen CEO of facial recognition company Kairos, told CNN Tech. Apple's Schiller joked on stage that user's should have a passcode if they have an evil twin. But what if you really have an identical twin? ""[Face ID] will probably not be spoofed by a 2D-photo or a mask, but it is more likely to be spoofed by a person who looks similar, like a close family relative or a twin,"" Brackeen said. Schiller noted on stage that Face ID's accuracy statistics are lower if someone shares a close genetic relationship with you, and Brackeen echoed this sentiment. However, Frances Zelazny, VP of global cybersecurity startup BioCatch, argues biometrics technology has ""gone a long way"" in telling the difference between identical twins and she doesn't see this as a concern. Related: The iPhone X will have wireless charging Face ID is also enabled for Apple Pay, the tech giant's mobile payments service. ""If Apple's facial recognition tool proves to be significantly flawed, it could really damage Apple's hopes for Apple Pay expansion. People simply won't use a payments tool if they don't think it is safe,"" said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com. He added this is a ""high-risk move"" for Apple in wake of Equifax's (EFX) recent breach, which exposed the personal information of as many as 143 million Americans, such as Social Security numbers and addresses. ""That debacle has put data security front and center in people's minds,"" Schulz said."
"The electric vehicle maker is aiming to unveil the Tesla Semi and do a test ride on Oct. 26, according to CEO Elon Musk. ""Worth seeing this beast in person,"" he tweeted late Wednesday. ""It's unreal."" The launch date is a bit later than Musk had suggested earlier this year. In April, he said Tesla, which is known for missing self-imposed time frames, would reveal the battery-powered truck in September. Tesla Semi truck unveil & test ride tentatively scheduled for Oct 26th in Hawthorne. Worth seeing this beast in person. It's unreal.  And drivers eager to get behind the wheel of the semi-truck, which is designed to transport cargo, are still likely to have a lengthy wait.

"None of this means the rumble of piston-power will be gone overnight. Or even over the next decade. The transition to electric cars will take many years and will involve a slow transition. As automakers look toward a future without fuel-burning cars, plug-in vehicles were a big part of this year's Frankfurt Motor Show. Mercedes-AMG Project One  The Mercedes-AMG Project One, is a plug-in hybrid that wrings every ounce of power out of a tiny 1.6 liter 6-cylinder engine. While Mercedes boasts of its impressive efficiency, none of the 275 people who have already signed up to buy this $2.7 million car are probably terribly bothered by fuel costs. With a total output of over 1,000 horsepower, thanks to three electric motors driving the wheels and one driving a turbocharger, this car is looking to compete in the supercar ranks of Ferrari, Lamborghini and McLaren. Mercedes Concept EQa  For those with the net worth not counted in billions, Mercedes (DDAIF) also unveiled the Concept EQa, a compact electric car. If you look closely, you can tell this is just a concept car. Those bumpers don't look like they'd take much bumping, the wheels fit a little too snugly inside the wheel wells and it doesn't have enough doors to be practical. If you squint, though, you can see a compact hatchback car that could join the planned EQ electric car line-up Mercedes announced at last year's Paris Motor Show. Honda  Honda's electric car also looks like a cute concept vehicle but Honda promises that something like it will go on sale in Europe in the next couple of years. The Honda EV concept is about four inches shorter than a Honda (HMC) Fit and it looks a bit a like 1970s Civic. A screen between the headlights can display messages for those outside. Smart  A Smart electric concept, unveiled by Mercedes' mini-car subsidiary, does the same sort of thing. It's a possible answer to the question of how autonomous cars of the future will interact with pedestrians. (If the driver isn't paying attention, they won't be able to wave at people to tell them to go ahead and cross, for instance.) Smart's Vision EQ concept is a fully autonomous vehicle that could be used for a car-sharing network, relying on ""swarm intelligence"" to predict where it will be needed next. Volkswagen  Volkswagen (VLKAF) is also filling out its planned electric car sub-brand, ID. The first ID car was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show almost a year ago. Later, in Detroit, Volkswagen unveiled the ID Buzz, an electric minibus that, it was announced recently, will go on sale in a few years. The Volkswagen ID Crozz was first unveiled at the Shanghai Motor Show in April but was it was shown at Frankfurt slightly changed. It's an electric compact crossover SUV. Crossovers are something that any car brand needs to succeed these days. BMW  BMW already has an electrified car sub-brand called BMW i. It currently has the blocky BMW i3 and the supercar-shaped i8. Again, BMW i Vision Dynamics is just a concept but it's something that would clearly make sense in BMWs electric car line-up. It's a real, practical car-shaped car with 373 miles of range, according to BMW, and a zero-to-60 time under four seconds. In other words, it would be the perfect BMW to directly take on Tesla. Mercedes GLC F-cell  Pure battery power isn't the only thing that can drive a no-combustion car, of course. Another option was on display, and actually very close to production, in the Mercedes-Benz GLC F-cell, a hydrogen powered plug-in hybrid. It uses hydrogen fuel cells that combine hydrogen gas with oxygen from the air to generate electricity. It can go about 430 miles on hydrogen power, emitting only water vapor as exhaust, plus another 30 miles on plug-in electricity. It's expected to be on sale in the United States by the end of 2019."
"Apple opened up its brand new Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, for the first time for a press conference. The circle-shaped headquarters was a passion project for Jobs', who wanted a futuristic location where employees could create the next generation of technology surrounded by nature. ""Apple Park has been built to reflect Apple's values, both for technology and the environment,"" said CEO Tim Cook. Hundreds of reporters and special guests were invited to the campus for a press conference announcing the latest Apple (AAPL, Tech30) products, including a new Apple Watch and and the $999, face-detecting iPhone X. The presentation took place at Steve Jobs Theater, a 1,000-seat underground circular theater with shockingly good cellular service. The theater is located under a vast open lobby surrounded with 20-foot high glass and a metallic carbon-fiber roof. The entire lobby is 165-feet in diameter. Related: Apple unveils new Apple Watch Located minutes from the current Apple headquarters, Apple Park's 175-acre campus is hidden from the surrounding suburban neighborhood with carefully placed rolling hills. There are over 9,000 trees on the campus, according to Cook. Much of the landscaping looks brand new, with young plants in rows and a smell of manure in the air. Running paths will weave through the campus, and employees can escape to an orchard, meadow or small pond when they need fresh air. Reporters were not allowed to roam around the main building, but it is said to have an open floor plan to encourage collaboration, to the alleged dismay of some employees. Cook said the campus is powered by 100% renewable energy, and has one of the largest on-site solar panel systems. The theater has comfortable brown leather seats with power ports hidden underneath. After Tuesday's presentation, the center of the building opened up to reveal a demo area where people could try out the new devices. Most of the campus, including green areas, will be closed off to the public, though there is an Apple Store and cafe near the entrance that anyone can visit. The store will sell the usual Apple products and accessories, along with custom shirts bearing the circular logo of Apple Park's main building for $40."
"The electric carmaker says it is temporarily extending the range of some of its vehicles. In other words, drivers who are trying to leave Florida or another evacuation zone are now able to travel up to 40 extra miles before they need to stop and recharge. The decision was reported earlier by Electrek. A Tesla (TSLA) spokesperson confirmed the move to CNNMoney on Sunday. Here's how it works: Tesla remotely triggered a software upgrade for some cars in the southeast, where Irma is expected to cause significant damage, according to the spokesperson. That update is allowing some Tesla batteries to travel for longer than they were previously able to. When Tesla built the cars, it used software to restrict the car batteries' range and sold them for a cheaper price point. Hurricane Irma: Live Updates Customers who wanted to unlock the full capacity could later spend money to get the upgrade. Tesla said it decided to temporarily extend the feature for free after one Irma evacuee requested it. The free upgrade will last until September 16. Some Tesla owners might have felt an advantage over drivers of gasoline-powered cars during the evacuations. There have been massive lines at pumping stations and widespread gas shortages throughout Florida. Related: Gas stations on Florida's west coast are running out of fuel No matter the type of fuel that powered their trips, people attempting to leave Florida via roadways still encountered miles of traffic jams. Millions have attempted to flee the state in the last few days. About 6.3 million people were in mandatory evacuation zones, according to the state's division of emergency management. That makes it potentially the largest evacuation in U.S. history. Irma made landfall in South Florida on Sunday as a Category 4 storm. --CNNMoney's Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this report."
"Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) on Thursday announced plans to open a second headquarters in North America. Dubbed ""HQ2,"" the facility will cost at least $5 billion to construct and operate and will employ as many as 50,000 workers. Cities and regional economic development organizations have been invited to submit proposals, and several cities have already expressed interest in the possibility of Amazon's new headquarters coming to their turf. A source close to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told CNN Tech the mayor has spoken ""several times"" with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about the second headquarters. Amazon declined to comment. A spokesperson for the city of Chicago wouldn't comment on whether it will submit a proposal, but gave the following statement: ""Chicago's unmatched workforce, world-class universities and unparalleled access to destinations throughout the world make it the perfect headquarters location for companies large and small. That's also why Chicago has led the nation in corporate relocations for the last four years."" Related: 10 cities living in the future Dallas expressed enthusiasm at the prospect, too.

Toronto's Mayor John Tory also said the city is a ""prime candidate"" for Amazon's second headquarters due to its ""homegrown tech talent."" The city's staff is working with investment attraction agency Toronto Global to put together ""an attractive bid"" for the opportunity. Meanwhile, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock said the state is ""excited"" about the possibility of hosting Amazon's second headquarters. Pittsburgh said it plans to ""compete"" for the new site and has already scheduled strategy sessions and started planning. ""This is a transformational opportunity unlike any that we've ever seen,"" Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto said in a statement. Pittsburgh could be a strong candidate for Amazon, considering it is already a major testing ground for self-driving car technology and robotics. Baltimore, Boston, Columbus, Detroit, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Vancouver and Washington D.C. also expressed interest. CNN Tech's Matt McFarland contributed to this report."
"Hundreds of millions of shoppers in China increasingly use their smartphones to buy everything from designer handbags to street snacks. At the heart of the country's digital payments boom are QR codes, two-dimensional images made up of a series of black and white squares. In the U.S. and Europe, QR codes (short for ""quick response"") never really took off. They are slowly becoming more common in social media apps: Snapchat (SNAP), Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Spotify have been pushing their users to scan the barcodes to unlock new filters, add friends or access playlists. But in China, QR codes are everywhere -- used by major retailers, street markets and even beggars and buskers. Related: Pay with your face at this KFC in China ""The market is colossal and it is still growing,"" said Shen Wei, deputy director of the a research institute that specializes in QR codes. He estimates that more than $1.65 trillion of transactions used the codes last year, accounting for about a third of all mobile payments in China. Tencent's (TCTZF) WeChat Pay and Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) spinoff Alipay are the dominant mobile payment apps in China. People can use them to pay in a store by scanning a product's QR code or showing their personal code to the cashier. The money is deducted from mobile wallets that are usually linked to regular bank accounts. 'If you don't do it, you will lose out' The codes are easy to create and use, making them popular with small retailers and street vendors who don't take credit cards, said Pan Helin, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences.  They've started cropping up in all kinds of situations. In April, Chinese media carried photos of a bridesmaid in Beijing who wore a QR code around her neck to collect gifts of money for the bride and groom, reportedly upsetting the groom's mother with the unorthodox behavior. Chinese wedding guests traditionally hand over money in red envelopes, but the bridesmaid said wearing the QR code would help people who forgot to bring enough cash with them. Related: How to land a job in China's booming tech sector But because the codes are so simple and accessible, they are also vulnerable to scammers who can try to trick users into scanning ones that install viruses designed to steal money or personal information. Business owners say they can't afford not to use QR codes. ""If you don't do it, you will lose out on revenue,"" said Alan Wong, an American businessman who owns 15 Japanese restaurants in Shanghai and Beijing. Wong added QR code payments at his restaurants less than two years ago and says he expects them to account for 70% of transactions in the near future.  Business cards, bikes and bills Beyond payments, the codes are now used for all sorts of services in China, like exchanging business cards and renting bikes. Chinese authorities are also getting on board. In Hangzhou, where Alibaba is headquartered, the local government has connected several public services to Alipay. Residents can now scan QR codes to pay for things like public transportation, utility bills and hospital visits. Other big cities have followed suit. Related: China's 'dockless' bike sharing could be coming to a street near you At the national level, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is investing heavily in research into QR codes.

"The two complexes are key for NASA's human spaceflight programs. The Houston base handles mission control operations, but Kennedy is home to a sprawling launch complex where rockets take flight. The Apollo missions, including the moon landing mission, launched from here. It's also a frequent launch site for the United State's burgeoning commercial space industry. SpaceX, the rocket company owned by Elon Musk, and United Launch Alliance, a Boeing (BA) and Lockheed (LMT) venture, have operations at Kennedy. Jeff Bezos's rocket outfit, Blue Origin, is also building a factory nearby. Similar to employees at the Houston complex, which suffered ""significant damage"" during Harvey, a small team of NASA employees is locked down inside Kennedy Space Center as Irma hurtles toward their compound. The group of 120 people is known as the ""ride-out team."" Related: SpaceX launches mysterious Air Force space plane ahead of Irma's arrival They're in charge of ensuring that Kennedy's essential infrastructure is kept safe as Irma tears through the area. One team member described his current living quarters: cots are bunched together where there's spare room, a table littered with snack food was assembled potluck style and there's only one shower for all 120 crew members. ""We're thinking about putting up a sign-up sheet,"" Brady Helms, an emergency management analyst at NASA said. Luckily, he said, they're only expected to be trapped inside for about 72 hours. Helms is calm and in good spirits. He's done this before. Just last year, he was part of the ride-out team that stayed put at Kennedy while Hurricane Matthew loomed. It reportedly caused millions in damages at the space complex, but no one was harmed. The structure the Kennedy crew is stationed at, the Emergency Operations Center, is built to withstand the fierce winds of a hurricane. Related: NASA astronauts returning to Houston from space after Harvey flooding Irma isn't expected to hit central Florida until late Sunday. It's also expected to veer toward the west coast, so the Kennedy complex, on the east coast, could avoid the full brunt of the storm. NASA still has plenty to be concerned about. Irma could carry fierce winds that top 100 mph. It's also expected to dump massive amounts of rain and unleash surging flood waters. But Helms said their primary concern is tornadoes. ""We're in a prime spot for tornadoes based on the latest estimates,"" he said. Nonetheless, the team is extremely organized and orderly, says Al Feinberg, a NASA spokesperson, who has joined the ride-out team for the first time. After the storm passes, the team will assess any damage and alert a recovery squad. For now, however, it's a lot of ""sitting and waiting,"" Helms told CNNMoney."
"The company said Friday that it's giving the donation to the ""Hand in Hand"" drive, an ongoing fundraiser that will divvy up funds between several organizations. The goal is to help victims of Hurricane Harvey -- which clobbered the Gulf Coat two weeks ago -- and Hurricane Irma, an even more powerful storm that is barreling towards Florida. Apple also said Friday that it will allow its customers to donate directly to the cause. ""Starting this weekend, anyone with an iPhone, iPad, Mac or PC running iTunes can donate directly through the App Store and iTunes,"" the company said in a statement. Related: Businesses donate over $160 million to Harvey relief efforts Apple says it donated another $3 million to the Red Cross after Harvey.

The fund's initial primary backers were Verizon (VZ, Tech30) and the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation. Michael Dell, a Houston native, has given $5 million to the fund. Verizon will be running a call center for the drive, and it has given $2.5 million to ""Hand in Hand,"" according to a press release.

"Bob Smith, the CEO of the space outfit founded by Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) mastermind Jeff Bezos, mentioned the new timeline during the first meeting of the newly revamped National Space Council on Thursday. That's a later date than Blue Origin had touted in the past. Just a year ago, the company's president, Rob Meyerson, said the first launch with passengers would be sometime in 2018. In an emailed statement to CNNMoney on Thursday, Blue Origin insisted its ""internal dates have not shifted,"" but added, ""we will fly humans when we're ready, and not a moment sooner."" The National Space Council, which has been revived under the Trump administration after a two-decade hiatus, includes Vice President Mike Pence and various other government officials. Its goal is to help coordinate space exploration and national security efforts by the public and private sectors. Smith briefly spoke to the panel about Blue Origin's plans to take paying customers to space. ""Within the next 18 months we're going to be launching humans into space,"" he said. ""These won't be astronauts...these will be everyday citizens."" Related: Jeff Bezos' new rocket has its first customer A 2019 launch would put Blue Origin's first space tourism trip slightly behind its competitor SpaceX, which is headed by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. SpaceX plans to take two tourists on a trip around the moon sometime in the last quarter of 2018. SpaceX confirmed Thursday that date hasn't been adjusted since the company first announced those plans back in February. (Note, however, that Musk is notorious for setting ambitious deadlines -- and blowing through them.) In the grand scheme of things, SpaceX and Blue Origin have very different strategies for space tourism. For Blue Origin, sending paying customers to space is part of the bedrock of it early business strategy. The company wants to conduct frequent launches to the edge of space -- where passengers can briefly experience weightlessness and marvel at the view. (So far, the company has only caonducted unmanned test launches of its New Shepherd rocket.) The goal is to make it relatively cheap for an Average Joe to enjoy spaceflight, though Blue Origin hasn't yet indicated exactly how much tickets will cost. The revenue it makes from ticket sales is supposed to help fund the company's future endeavors, such as launching satellites into space. Bezos also told reporters in April that he sells about $1 billion worth of his Amazon shares every year in order to keep Blue Origin stocked with cash, according to Reuters. Related: Blue Origin unveils space capsule with 'largest windows in space' SpaceX is in some sense doing the opposite. The company already has a lucrative business delivering satellites to space and sending cargo to the International Space Station. Those efforts are meant to help fund its ultimate goal: Send perhaps the bravest space tourists to live on Mars. Meanwhile, SpaceX's moon trip appears to be a one-off commitment the company made to two people. SpaceX has not revealed how much it's charging the passengers -- though it's undoubtedly a significant sum, likely many millions. Blue Origin does have plans to build a much more powerful rocket, called New Glenn, that's capable of competing with SpaceX for satellite launch contracts. Smith, the Blue Origin CEO, said Thursday that the factory where New Glenn will be manufactured will likely be completed by the end of the year. But even after it's built, the company will have to complete the long, tedious process of certifying the rocket to fly. Bezos has said the first launch of that rocket will be in 2020."
"Now an even more elite group is emerging: startups selected by a $100 billion investment fund from SoftBank (SFTBF). ""It's one thing to be a unicorn, it's another thing to be backed by a firm with the global footprint and wherewithal of SoftBank,"" says Doug Mack, CEO of Fanatics, which raised $1 billion last month led by the fund. The startup is now valued at $4.5 billion. ""On a global basis, it's a major credibility building moment for a company like ours,"" Mack says. SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, announced plans one year ago this month for a staggering fund backed by Saudi Arabia to focus on the tech industry. The Vision Fund is still in the process of raising the final $7 billion, but it has already proven to be a 100 billion pound gorilla in Silicon Valley. The fund's stated mission is to invest in ""foundational platforms"" that will shape the world in the decades to come. In particular, SoftBank's investment team is focusing on areas like artificial intelligence, robotics and enterprise applications. Softbank has invested billions this year in startups like WeWork, Slack and Fanatics, a sports e-commerce company, with more businesses eager to join the club. This week, Uber's board voted to move forward with a deal that could see SoftBank invest as much as $10 billion. The nearly unprecedented scale of these investments offers startups the perks of going public without the hassle, possibly cutting down what is already a low number of tech IPOs. Early investors can cash out, as is expected to happen with Uber. And executives can use the funds to scoop up rivals and attract top talent. Related: As Uber stumbles, rivals mobilize abroad Those who've partnered with SoftBank stress that the firm is more willing to take a longer view of startups than public market investors. That's particularly enticing as tech companies like Snap (SNAP) and Blue Apron (APRN) are struggling after going public this year. ""What you traditionally get in a public market offering is a large sum of money,"" says Rob Frohwein, CEO of Kabbage, a small business loan service that raised $250 million from SoftBank in August. The investment was not through the Vision Fund. ""What you get from SoftBank is a large sum of money and you have a partner who wants to invest in your vision."" SoftBank's backing can elevate the media profiles of startups and help pave the way for expansion abroad, particularly in Asia where SoftBank has its roots. In statements, the CEOs of Slack and WeWork each highlighted international expansion efforts. But SoftBank can also shift how these businesses are run and upend entire markets. Nowhere is this more evident than with Uber. After a year full of internal chaos and PR crises, Uber agreed to make a series of corporate governance changes in part to pave the way for the SoftBank deal. Call it the allure of SoftBank cutting a big check -- or the threat of that check going to a competitor. SoftBank had said it might invest in either Uber or Lyft. SoftBank has previously invested billions in Uber's rivals in Asia and South America. Once the Uber investment is complete, SoftBank will cement its position at the center of the lucrative ride-hailing market, with the potential to broker deals and partnerships. Woody Marshall, a partner at TCV who has invested in Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) and Airbnb, says SoftBank's money could put it in a position to bring competing startups to the table to ""accelerate strategic discussions."" SoftBank declined to comment for this story. The mastermind behind the Vision Fund is SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, a self-described ""crazy"" billionaire who has talked up a 300-year plan for the company. Related: Where the huge SoftBank-Saudi tech fund is investing ""We will look to take 20-40% stakes in the companies in which we invest,"" Son said at a press conference earlier this year about the Vision Fund strategy. ""We will become the leading shareholder and a board member, and will talk about running the companies and creating strategies with the founders through an organic relationship."" Some may criticize SoftBank for appearing to throw money at startups when there are longstanding concerns about excessive funding and lofty valuations in Silicon Valley. WeWork, for example, was not actively raising funds this year when the SoftBank deal came along, according to a source familiar with the matter. SoftBank ended up investing $4.4 billion in the startup, which provides coworking spaces. ""SoftBank coming in with their wherewithal and size probably influenced our thinking on the size of the [funding] round,"" Mack said. ""If we had worked with other partners, it might not have been at this scale."" By offering up billions of dollars, SoftBank could end up making it more difficult for traditional venture capital firms to compete for certain startup investments. ""I would like to say it doesn't change anything,"" Marshall says, ""but of course it does whenever you've got somebody who has that much money."""
"The company updated its search algorithm Thursday to promote authoritative news sources at the top of search results, according to a person familiar with the matter. YouTube has been working on the change for months, but decided to release it early after conspiracy videos surfaced on its site about the Las Vegas shooting. Visitors searching YouTube for information about Sunday's shooting or shooter Stephen Paddock have been directed to videos pushing conspiracy theories. They claim there where were multiple shooters, that the shooting was staged by the U.S. government, and that Paddock was an anti-Trump activist, among other things. The issue picked up steam on social media Wednesday and was documented in articles from Buzzfeed and The Guardian. Now a search for ""Stephen Paddock"" on YouTube shows results from news outlets like the BBC, USA Today, and NBC News on top. You have to scroll down to the 28th result for a conspiracy video connecting Paddock to anti-fascist groups. Related: Google and Facebook help spread bad information after Las Vegas attack However, once you watch one conspiracy video, YouTube still recommends other conspiracy videos, though there are some established new sources mixed in. YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet, is the latest tech company to come under fire for propagating misinformation about current events, specifically the shooting in Las Vegas. Facebook and Google have also been criticized for featuring unreliable stories and sources following the shooting. For instance, Google linked to threads from online message board 4chan in its Top News results that identified the wrong person as the shooter. Facebook's Crisis Response page, where people can ""check-in"" as safe after an incident, included links to questionable stories by sites Alt Right News and The Gateway Pundit. Both Facebook and Google took those links down. YouTube's change will affect searches for major news stories, not just Las Vegas. And the company says it may make further changes to combat misinformation in the future."
"Spin Master, the toymaker behind 2016's biggest toy phenomenon, showed off on Thursday the next-generation version of its product. Called Hatchimals Surprise, two furry interactive toys self-hatch out of a single egg. The twins, which could either be identical or fraternal, interact with each other (and you), and their personalities age in maturity in the weeks following their birth. The original Hatchimals' debut last year sparked a buying frenzy. Desperate parents stood in line for hours to score one for kids ahead of the holidays. Some enterprising entrepreneurs stockpiled the toy and made a killing by reselling them on eBay (EBAY). Toy industry analyst Jim Silver estimates Spin Master sold two million Hatchimals last year, logging about $80 million in revenue. He believes Hatchimals Surprise could be even a bigger success this shopping season. ""Having seen their new Hatchimals products for this year, I think the brand could triple sales to $250 million,"" he said. Spin Master declined to comment on Hatchimals sales. While the original Hatchimals pecked their way out of the egg, the twins take on a more realistic approach. ""[They] burst their way out of the top, very much like we see real animals come out of an egg,"" said James Martin, head of robotics at Spin Master. ""Their hatching experience is totally different [than the original]."" Related: 11 hottest toys for this holiday season The siblings sit on top of each other. It takes between seven to 15 minutes for the egg to hatch, and it needs your help. Hatchimals owners have to interact with the egg which features touch technology. You'll need to hold, tap and talk to the egg to move along the process. A high-tech mechanism inside the toy allows it to crack through the egg. The first twin breaks out on its own. Eventually, you'll need to reach into the egg to pull the second one out. Unlike the first Hatchimals, the twins interact with each other through built-in sensors. They giggle and say ""I love you"" when they face each other. They also get upset when they're apart for too long. If you press one of their noses, it will sing. The other sibling reacts by dancing, rocking back and forth and flapping its wings. Both include LED eyes. They also play games and repeat words. This feature ignited a controversy last year when some parents said the most-hyped toy of the season had a potty mouth. In videos posted on YouTube, parents insisted their Hatchimals toy swore in its sleep. But the company declined the claims, stating Hatchimals don't speak English -- they have their own made-up language. However, the toy repeats what the users says, up to three seconds of sound, and Spin Master said it can't control what's said to it. ""It does repeat what you say to it. We can't control that,"" he said. ""We respect that people may think they hear something, but we have put the toy through very rigorous testing."" language.Related: 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' pits BB-8 against its dark side, BB-9E Hatchimals Surprise ($70) includes two ""species"": a Giraven, a mix of a giraffe and a raven, and a Peacat, a combination of a peacock and a cat.

Last year's species -- Pengualas and Draggles -- will slowly be phased out . Spin Master is eager to grow Hatchimals beyond just toys. ""We're expanding into licensed goods like T-shirts, bedding, even costumes. The possibilities are endless,"" said Martin."
"The efforts to lure the tech giant to town have been both big and creative, from sending a giant cactus to CEO Jeff Bezos to offering big tax breaks. A Georgia town even said it would de-annex some of its land and name it the city of Amazon. Last month, Amazon announced plans to open another headquarters in North America. Called ""HQ2,"" the facility will cost at least $5 billion to construct and operate, and will employ as many as 50,000 workers. Cities and regional economic development organizations have been invited to submit proposals, due by October 19. Amazon has detailed a list of preferences, such as a suburban or urban area with more than 1 million people and a place that will attract technical talent. ""We're energized by the response from cities across North America who have expressed interest in hosting Amazon HQ2.

""We'll work with Governor [Doug] Ducey and the Arizona Commerce Authority closely to submit a strong case."" Thx @SunCorridorInc! Unfortunately we can't accept gifts (even really cool ones) so we donated it to @DesertMuseum ?? https://t.co/ZJPQfs44cq pic.twitter.com/Fot06Kgs9P  But Bezos won't be planting the cactus outside Amazon's Seattle campus anytime soon. The company tweeted that it couldn't accept gifts and donated the cactus to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. Birmingham Birmingham, Alabama has installed three massive Amazon delivery boxes around the city to coincide with the launch of Mayor William Bell's formal bid for the second headquarters. The city plans to add more boxes, too.  ""We needed to do something very dramatic to get the attention of Amazon and the public to let them know we're serious about it,"" Mayor Bell told CNN Tech. Stonecrest, Georgia Amazon, Georgia? Earlier this week, the Stonecrest City Council in Georgia voted to de-annex 345 acres of its land if selected for Amazon's second home. The new area would be called the city of Amazon. ""We had to have a differentiator,"" Stonecrest Mayor Jason Lary told CNN Tech. ""What's a better opportunity than to give a company the size of Amazon their own city?"" Stonecrest, which officially became a city in January, is about 20 miles from Atlanta. It has a population of 53,000. ""What we're offering [Amazon] is the ability to control their brand and their city forever,"" Lary said. Connecticut, Texas and Washington D.C. Mayors from Danbury, Connecticut, Frisco, Texas and Washington D.C. have enlisted Alexa's help. In separate videos, each mayor asked Amazon's voice assistant where the best place for the company's second headquarters is, and Alexa answered with their respective city name. In one video, Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser mentioned Bezos already has a home in the District. (Bezos is also the owner of the Washington Post). ""They want to be on the East Coast right? It makes sense. They have the West Coast Washington and the East Coast Washington,"" Bowser said in the video. Related: Cities already want to host Amazon's second headquarters Chicago Cities like Chicago are recruiting Fortune 500 CEOs to help. Last week, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner announced a committee to bring Amazon's new home to the Windy City. The group is co-chaired by chief executives like Oscar Munoz, head of United Airlines (UAL), and Miles White, who leads healthcare company Abbott (ABT). Overall, the committee is made up of over 600 business leaders from the financial, tech, arts and culture, civic and education sectors. A source close to Mayor Emanuel previously told CNN Tech the mayor has spoken ""several times"" with Bezos about the second headquarters. New Jersey New Jersey could offer Amazon $5 billion in tax breaks spread out over 20 years. That is, if a new proposed law is passed. The current law in the state caps incentives at $5,000 per job created. But a proposed legislative change for ""transformative projects"" -- such as Amazon's new headquarters -- would increase that to $10,000 over 20 years, according to a spokesman for Governor Chris Christie. The governor said the new law, which has not yet been crafted in detail, would be limited to projects of this magnitude. The Bay Area Amazon has encouraged cities to team up on one bid -- and some are indeed joining forces. The Bay Area Council, a public policy advocacy organization, is coordinating a joint proposal with California cities like Oakland, San Francisco and Fremont. A spokesperson for the group said it didn't yet have details on an incentive package. ""We won't be including any cacti. But we may throw in a pinot,"" the spokesman joked. Philadelphia A team from Philadelphia, including developers and representatives from the Mayor's Office and the Chamber of Commerce, flew to Seattle last week to meet with people ""intimately familiar"" with Amazon's culture to better prepare a bid, according to a spokeswoman for Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney. She noted that the group did not meet with people who are making decisions on the bid. ""The business community in Philadelphia has not been more excited about anything in the time I've been here,"" said Michael Araten, the CEO of toy company K'NEX, who also sits on an executive committee for the city's Chamber of Commerce. Meanwhile, hundreds of students from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school are participating in contests hosted by the school for the best HQ2 proposal. Related: Jeff Bezos is the smartest guy in business New York City New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters that he's never shopped on Amazon before, but that doesn't mean his city isn't interested in hosting Amazon's second headquarters. ""I have never ordered from Amazon. That's no disrespect to Amazon. God bless Amazon. I believe in bricks-and-mortar,"" de Blasio said. Despite never using the platform, his administration is working on a proposal for the second headquarters, he said. Canada Canadian cities such as Toronto and Vancouver are also throwing their hat into the ring. These places could be especially attractive given uncertainty surrounding immigration in the U.S., according to Ravi Madhavan, a professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh and an expert in corporate strategy. ""If [Amazon] wants to hire tens of thousands of tech employees, they have to think be thinking about the visa environment. [Canada] will give them a terrific hedge,"" Madhavan said.  A spokeswoman for Toronto Global, a firm putting together the Toronto region's bid, also touted Canada's immigration policies. ""Our open immigration policies make it easier for companies to gain access to global talent, and our inclusive and tolerant society makes Canada and the Toronto Region a top choice for international students,"" the spokeswoman said. A spokeswoman for the Vancouver Economic Commission made a similar argument. ""Canada's immigration system, with a two-week turnaround time for tech workers' visas, is incredibly welcoming,"" she said. Austin, Dallas and more Tech hubs such as Austin, Boston, Dallas, Denver and Pittsburgh have said they would submit proposals, too. Pittsburgh could be a strong candidate for the new facility. It's already a major testing ground for self-driving cars and robotics. Meanwhile, tech companies like Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB, Tech30) already have offices in Austin. ""It's a really fun thing to watch. At the end of the day, I think it will be a positive both for [Amazon] and the cities competing,"" Madhavan said. Only one city will be able to host the corporate headquarters, but Amazon continues to expand with new warehouses and facilities. Cities who aren't chosen could potentially be considered for other facilities later on. ""Even if a city doesn't get this, it's a good thing to be in front of Amazon's management to convince them about the strengths of their city,"" Madhavan said. ""It's not the last major location position Amazon will be making."""

""There are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 or the supply chain,"" the company said in its statement. ""We understand what needs to be fixed and we are confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term.""

Tesla did not respond to a questions about a new production target. Related: GM - The future is all-electric ""This should come as no surprise,"" said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with Autotrader. ""This is the first volume vehicle they've ever produced. Making cars is not an easy business, and they're finding that out."" But the Model 3 is not the first time it has fallen well behind promised production targets. Tesla's high-priced crossover, the Model X, went into production in late 2015, long after originally promised and had a slower-than-expected roll out. Production of the Model S sedan, its best selling vehicle to date, was also much slower than originally promised. Krebs said Tesla missing deadlines is ""part of their track record."" But Tesla said those problems are now well behind it, and the company said it had record production of both those luxury models in the third quarter -- building just over 25,000 of the two models in that quarter.

"Now the Federal Communications Commission chairman is about to extend his tenure on the job. The Senate voted largely along party lines Monday to confirm Pai to another five-year term at the FCC. Pai, formerly a Republican commissioner at the FCC, was appointed to run the agency in January by President Trump. His term was set to expire this year. ""I am deeply grateful to the U.S. Senate for confirming my nomination to serve a second term at the FCC and to President Trump for submitting that nomination to the Senate,"" Pai said in a statement after the vote. Pai's confirmation faced strong opposition from Senate Democrats, advocacy groups and some former FCC officials. One recent petition calling for the Senate to fire Pai, promoted by Free Press, received ""tens of thousands"" of signatures, according to Timothy Karr, the group's senior director of strategy. ""Chairman Pai has worked at breakneck speed to transform the FCC from an agency that works in the public interest to a big business support group,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said on the Senate floor Monday. In the statement, Pai said the FCC has been ""focused on bridging the digital divide, promoting innovation, protecting consumers and public safety, and making the FCC more open and transparent."" The outcry over Pai's reconfirmation is both a criticism of, and a testament to, Pai's impact on the job so far. Other regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission still await permanent leadership under Trump. ""What really sets Pai apart from other Trump appointees is he really knows what he's doing. He's both an expert on substance and process,"" says Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler. Sohn has also called for Pai to be fired over his efforts to dismantle consumer protections put in place by the previous administration. ""He's been far too effective for my taste,"" he says. Related: Here's how Trump's FCC affects you Pai's most high-profile effort to date has been moving forward with a proposal to roll back net neutrality protections. The rules were put in place by the FCC during the Obama administration to prevent Internet providers from deliberately speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific websites and apps. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, had been a longtime critic of the rules. The proposed rollback prompted protests online and offline from net neutrality advocates, including Facebook (FB, Tech30), Google (GOOGL, Tech30), Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) and Amazon (AMZN, Tech30). Pai also applauded Trump and Congress for repealing FCC Internet privacy protections that would have given consumers an extra safeguard online, a move that set off a similar public outcry. Michelle Connolly, a former FCC official who supports Pai, says the added attention and heated debates around these issues are the result of the ubiquity of tech in our lives. ""Everyone uses the internet and everyone uses these tech platforms and everyone is personally concerned about privacy and hacking,"" she says. ""So issues that are coming up right now, people are seeing from a very personal perspective."" The outrage extends beyond tech issues. On the eve of the renomination, nearly two dozen Senate Democrats sent a letter to Pai expressing ""grave concerns"" with his move to upend the media landscape. Earlier this year, the FCC voted to reinstate the ""UHF discount,"" which allows broadcasters to understate the reach of their stations. Opponents argued the move would pave the way for greater consolidation of broadcasters. Shortly after, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced plans to acquire Tribune Media in a deal that would push the total TV stations it owns above 200 nationwide. Related: Trump's FCC criticized for hurricane response ""Moves to repeal the media ownership rules threatens to create a world of corporatized, nationalized content being force fed to consumers under the guise of local news and public affairs programming,"" the senators wrote.

Pai touts himself as an outspoken First Amendment defender, but nonetheless raised alarms earlier in his term as chairman about his views on the media. In a March hearing, Pai was grilled by two senators about Trump's claim that the media is the ""enemy of the people."" Rather than condemn the remarks outright, Pai said: ""I don't want to wade into the larger political debates."""
"That brings the total number of people caught up in the massive hack to 145.5 million. Equifax (EFX) will alert the additional potentially affected consumers by mail. The website used to determine whether someone was impacted in the breach will be updated to include the new potential victims by October 8, the credit monitoring company said in a statement. Equifax hired cybersecurity firm Mandiant to investigate the major breach in August - a month before it publicly disclosed that the personal information of millions of customers might have been compromised. On Monday, Equifax announced Mandiant completed its forensic investigation and revised the number of people impacted by the hack. The new findings included only U.S. consumers, but Equifax also said personal information of 8,000 Canadian consumers was impacted, down from an initial estimate of 100,000. Federal and state officials are probing the breach and potential executive insider trading.

Hackers accessed names, addresses, social security numbers, and some driver's licenses through a flaw in software known as Apache Struts. The flaw was disclosed in March, but Equifax failed to detect and fix the hole. Criminals stole the data between May and July, Equifax said. The company is offering free credit monitoring and credit freezing for people who are concerned about their data falling into the wrong hands. Smith retired last week. Equifax's chief information officer and chief security officer also retired last month."
"That's what the automaker said on Monday, as it unveiled plans to roll out two new electric vehicles over the next 18 months and a total of 20 over the next six years. ""General Motors believes in an all-electric future,"" said Mark Reuss, General Motors' head of product development. For now, though, GM isn't saying exactly when that purely electric future will be. GM recently launched its first mass-market electric vehicle, the Chevrolet Bolt EV, an electric mid-sized hatchback with a range of 238 miles on a charge and a starting price of about $36,000. Engineers and designers will build on GM's electric lineup from there, the automaker said. Not all of GM's electric vehicles will use batteries -- some will use hydrogen gas for power instead, GM said. These hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will use compressed hydrogen gas which is combined with oxygen on board the vehicle to produce electricity. ""The industry continues to slowly shift towards electric vehicles, with a majority of automakers fully jumping onboard,"" said Akshay Anand, executive analyst for Kelley Blue Book. He noted that the technology is advancing quickly and that more progress is expected.  California-based Tesla was among the first to break into the market for electrical vehicles. But the Model X and the Model S are luxury vehicles with prices starting over $70,000. The company recently rolled out the bare-bones Model 3 for just $35,000, similar to the price of the Bolt, which is now available nationwide. But Nissan is the overall sales leader in electric cars thanks to its far cheaper Nissan Leaf, which starts at $30,000. Nissan recently announced a redesigned version of that car, with longer range and a price that remains lower than even Tesla's new, more accessible, Model 3. Several other automakers, including the Volkswagen Group and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, have also recently announced plans to move towards electric cars. Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi announced it would launch 12 new all-electric vehicles by 2022. Volkswagen said it will have hybrid or electric versions of all of its models by 2030. It's also creating a new all-electric sub-brand, ID, that will include a new electric version of the iconic VW microbus."
"This week is shaping up to be an early and crucial test for whether Khosrowshahi can follow through on that goal. Uber is expected to vote Tuesday on a measure that could lessen the influence of ousted former CEO Travis Kalanick and also set a deadline for the startup to go public. One part of the measure up for consideration would eliminate special voting powers granted to early Uber investors, according to two sources close to the situation. The move would shift power away from Kalanick. Another part would give Khosrowshahi, the former CEO of Expedia (EXPE), more power to fill board seats, according to the sources. The proposal comes after months of PR crises, executive departures and infighting among the board, all of which have threatened to undermine the brand and momentum of the world's most valuable startup. But the latest board deliberation has already exposed a possible power struggle between Uber's new and old CEOs, who had tried to make nice in public just a month ago. On Friday, Kalanick blindsided Uber by preempting the board vote with the appointment of two new board members: the former CEOs of Xerox (XRX) and Merrill Lynch. Related: Ousted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick shakes up board of directors Despite being pressured to resign as CEO in June, Kalanick remains a board member and also controls the two additional board seats.

Kalanick said he was making the appointments in response to the ""proposal to dramatically restructure the board and significantly alter the company's voting rights."" He said it is ""essential"" for the ""full Board to be in place"" to deliberate on the proposal. Uber responded by calling the move a ""complete surprise."" The boardroom battle serves as yet another glaring reminder of Uber's internal dysfunction and the need for corporate governance reforms.

"Governments, which have long struggled to afford bikeshare systems, are suddenly seeing startups offer free bikes to cities. Previously, cities needed millions of dollars to acquire bikes and stations for parking. But now, money isn't a barrier to introducing a bikeshare system. Transportation experts have pointed to bicycling as a way to address congestion, pollution and public health issues. Although it's often the fastest way to get around urban areas, the cost of a bikeshare program has limited it as viable public transportation method. Even cities with the nation's largest bikeshare systems such as New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C. haven't expanded to every neighborhood or offered enough bikes to trigger a tipping point. But in the last year, investors in China and California's Silicon Valley have poured billions of dollars into bikesharing startups that have a unique twist: bikes can be parked in locations other than docking stations. Riders find bikes via smartphone apps and can leave them in approved parking spots, such as public bike racks, next to street signs or at street corners, provided sidewalks aren't blocked. This means bikes don't need to be returned to docking stations, which are expensive to build and often inconvenient for riders. This style of bikeshare was first popularized in China. Now, Chinese companies such as ofo and Mobike, which have each raised more than $1 billion to grow the concept, are expanding to the United States. Meanwhile, U.S.-based startups, such as Spin and LimeBike, are also cutting costs dramatically by relying on dockless technology. The shift could ignite a bicycling renaissance in the U.S. -- or end in failure, according to bicycling and transportation experts. ""The jury is still out, but it's promising,"" Tim Blumenthal , president of PeopleForBikes, told CNN Tech. ""Nobody in the U.S. knows how it will play out."" For example, cities such as Seattle are shifting from offering one bikeshare option, funded by taxpayer dollars, to a system where private bikeshare companies are granted a permit to operate at no cost to the city. Previously, cities have had to pay up to $5,000 per bicycle to operate a system. The permits make it easier for companies to operate, and cities can spend money elsewhere. ""This is the moment everyone in the industry has been hoping for,"" said Nick Foley, the head of product at Social Bicycles, which operates the dockless bikeshare service Jump Mobility. In coming years, experts believe the companies will equip bikes with cameras and additional sensors to collect valuable data that will be sold to advertisers. Seattle's transportation department, which pioneered a permitting process for the first major deployment of dockless bikeshare, has heard from more than 50 curious cities seeking advice. Related: How Seattle morphed from bikeshare failure to industry leader in 5 months Dallas is among the cities embracing a dockless bikeshare revolution. It welcomed the trend last summer. Councilman Lee M. Kleinman, who chairs the city's transportation committee, said he previously envied New York's bikeshare system, CitiBike. ""I just banged my head against the wall for years. Why can't we get something like this in Dallas?"" Kleinman told CNN Tech. ""Unfortunately, we can't spend money on everything. There were always budgetary constraints."" But that changed. Kleinman heard from Silicon Valley startups that wanted to operate in the city. The city wouldn't have to pay anything to get the program up and running. In August, thousands of bikes from LimeBike, and its competitor Spin, arrived on Dallas streets as a part of a pilot program. Kleinman said there haven't been complaints so far. A similar script is playing out outside Boston in Revere, Massachusetts. Mayor Brian Arrigo said he previously failed to convince Boston's bikeshare officials to expand to his town. But this week, ofo launched 200 of its dockless bicycles in Revere. The move is also a game changer for cities that already have shared bikes. Washington, D.C. has become the first U.S. city to experiment with how dockless bikeshare options complement the existing system of docked bicycles. In a month's time, the fleet of shared bicycles in the nation's capital has grown by 50% due to startups like Jump Mobility and LimeBike entering the city. Ofo will launch next week. Washington D.C. department of transportation official Sam Zimbabwe, who oversees bikeshare in the city, said dockless systems may address the most common complaints about Capital Bikeshare: There aren't enough bikes, convenient stations and places to park. Some cities such as Arlington, Virginia are taking a more cautious approach by waiting to see how the method is received. ""It's exciting, but we'll have to see,"" said Henry Dunbar, who leads bike transportation in Arlington, nearby Washington D.C. ""There will be an impact. I just can't tell you exactly what it will be."" There are still questions about potential drawbacks of dockless technology. The programs have generally been successful in China, but some cities have reported piles of neglected bicycles cluttering the streets due to few regulations. U.S. cities and the startups have pledged to avoid a similar fate by monitoring bike parking and slowly deploying new bicycles so demand isn't exceeded. For example, LimeBike has five people tracking its 400 bikes across Washington, D.C. If the dockless model works, bicycling may become a viable transportation option in many cities, with millions of shared bicycles appearing in cities. Related: The case for bicycles' inevitable triumph over cars LimeBike CEO Toby Sun envisions riders never having to walk more than a block or two to find a bike. His company estimates one day having as many as 30,000 bikes in Seattle, five times as many bikes as are in the city now. There's no best practice for how many bikes per resident make sense in a city. But U.S. cities appear to be a long way from maxing out on bikes. Beijing, for example, has about one shared bicycle for every 10 residents. Washington, D.C. has one shared bike for every 175 residents. ""It's an incredible opportunity for cities,"" said Russell Meddin, editor of BikeSharingMap.com. ""Many U.S. cities could take five to 20 times as many bikes as they have today, finally fulfilling the potential of public bicycle transportation."""
"This concept vehicle is essentially a giant self-driving platform that can hold any kind of vehicle body -- or even just cargo. Something like this could be useful in disaster zones or in conflicts, the automaker said. That's why the truck will be displayed at a meeting of the Association of the United States Army next week. The Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure can be used with a cab attached to house a driver, or it can be used as simply platform to carry cargo on its own. A line of these trucks could, for instance, follow behind one with a human driver.  The truck is powered by hydrogen fuel cells that combine hydrogen gas with oxygen from the atmosphere to generate electricity. On-board tanks can store enough compressed hydrogen to drive 400 miles. GM has been working on hydrogen fuel cell projects with the military for many years. Earlier this year, the U.S. military began testing a hydrogen-powered GM pickup called the ZH2 . And last year, the Navy began testing a GM-produced hydrogen-powered unmanned submarine. Hydrogen power is particularly well-suited for military use, according to GM (GM), because fuel cells produce very little heat. That makes them harder for enemies to detect. Additionally, hydrogen can be produced in the field from a number of different sources, which means that fuel for the vehicles won't always have to be transported to the vehicles. GM (GM) designers have also experimented with the idea of interchangeable bodies in the past. Fifteen years ago, GM unveiled a hydrogen-powered concept car called the AUTOnomy, which had interchangeable bodies that rode on a flat platform."

"AIM will officially shut down on December 15 after 20 years in service, its parent company announced Friday. The news marks the end of an era for anyone who came of age with the internet in the late 90s and early 2000s. When AIM launched in 1997, using the World Wide Web required a desktop computer with a clunky dial-up connection that tied up the phone lines. Perhaps more than any other product, AIM helped establish the internet as a place to hang out rather than being a simple utility. AIM offered a platform for people to express themselves with embarrassing screen names, profiles filled with colorful fonts and emotional lyrics, and as many messages as you could send before someone in your house kicked you offline. The product earned a coveted spot in pop culture, making cameos in You've Got Mail and Sex and the City. But the service that defined the internet for a generation of users failed to evolve with them. Related: In memoriam: 13 tech products we lost A decade after AIM launched, Apple kicked off the smartphone era with the release of the original iPhone. Untethered from their computers, internet users shifted to a range of messaging apps and social networks like Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Twitter (TWTR, Tech30). AIM, with a brand recognized by millions, could have capitalized on this shift and emerged as a lead player in the billion-dollar messaging space. Instead, it faded further and further from relevance. Oath, the company created earlier this year from Verizon's merging of AOL and Yahoo, acknowledged this unfortunate fact in its announcement Friday of AIM's shutdown. ""AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,"" Michael Albers, VP of communications product at Oath, wrote in a blog post. Case in point: The announcement of AIM's shutdown was made on Twitter and Tumblr, two of the newer communications platforms that helped displace it. Eulogies poured in for AIM on Twitter, with users remembering old screen names and lamenting the passage of time. As one user put it, ""I can't decide which John Mayer song I should quote to express my sadness at the death of AOL Instant Messenger."" Farewell, AIM. We hope that somehow you'll ~BrB~."

It previewed more than two dozen emoji that fit into these categories, including a hedgehog, a carton of Chinese takeout, a giraffe, fairy, dinosaur, broccoli, sled, a scarf and vampire. There's also a hand signing ""I love you"" and an angry emoji face with explicit characters blocking the mouth. The new emoji will appear in the developer and public beta previews of iOS 11.1. Apple (AAPL, Tech30)said they will be more widely available in upcoming software updates for iOS, macOS and watchOS. The update will also include the emoji announced on World Emoji Day earlier this year, such as a breastfeeding mom and a woman in a headscarf.  Related: Apple unveils new emoji, including breastfeeding mom Apple (AAPL, Tech30) has stepped up efforts to include more diverse options, such as the new gender-neutral characters. It's also added more skin tones and country flags in recent updates. Apple isn't the only company trying to make emoji more inclusive. Earlier this year, Facebook (FB, Tech30) released a slate of new family emoji with a range of skin tones and family makeups. The new emoji are Apple's interpretation of symbols approved this year by the Unicode Consortium, a nonprofit that sets the global standard for emoji and other software. Companies like Apple and Google create versions for their platforms based on the guidelines. That's why emoji look different on iPhones than on Android devices.  Android has also recently redesigned its emoji and added new options like a T-Rex, orange heart and vomiting face. Its previous emoji were criticized for looking like blobs."
"Travis Kalanick, the ousted CEO and co-founder who still has a seat on Uber's board of directors, apparently blindsided the company Friday by appointing two new board members. Kalanick tapped Ursula Burns, former CEO of Xerox (XRX), and John Thain, former chief executive of Merrill Lynch. ""I am appointing these seats now in light of a recent Board proposal to dramatically restructure the Board and significantly alter the company's voting rights. It is therefore essential that the full Board be in place for proper deliberation to occur,"" Kalanick said in a statement. Kalanick said he has ""no doubt the Board will be well-served"" by his appointees ""as Uber moves into the next phase of growth and prepares for a public offering,"" the statement reads. Uber said in its own statement the move came as a ""complete surprise."" Related: Ursula Burns says it's a 'time of power' for women in tech ""That is precisely why we are working to put in place world-class governance to ensure that we are building a company every employee and shareholder can be proud of,"" the statement reads. Kalanick, who left the CEO role in June amid a series of scandals, does have the right under the board's current rules to make appointments. But those rules are at the root of a lawsuit that's currently in arbitration, and at the center of an ongoing controversy. Benchmark, a venture capital firm that took an early stake in Uber, filed a complaint against Kalanick in August. It claims Kalanick withheld important, relevant information about the company's scandals before the board voted to allow him to control three seats. Related: Uber CEO to meet London transport boss as ban looms According to a source familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Kalanick had not filled two of those board seats up until this point because he was ""trying to respect"" the legal process. Kalanick was prompted to make the appointments this week, however, when he learned about a proposal by the company's leadership and Goldman Sachs (GS), an Uber adviser. Here's what the measure includes, according to two sources close to the situation: --It would revamp rules in a way that would eliminate special voting powers previously granted to some of Uber's early investors. The move would shift a great deal of voting power away from Kalanick, though he still owns a large stake in the company. --It would apply a deadline by which Uber must go public. And if by the deadline the board has not approved an initial public offering -- but at least one-third of the board wants to move forward with an IPO -- the approving board members can appoint new board members until they reach a majority. --It would alter Kalanick's control over his three board seats and shift more control to Dara Khosrowshahi, Kalanick's replacement as Uber's CEO. (Kalanick currently occupies one of the three board seats he controls. The proposal would not change that.) The board may vote on the measure Tuesday. Former board member David Plouffe said in a tweet posted Friday that the Trump White House ""seems sane by comparison"" to Uber's corporate politics. He also voiced his support for Khosrowshahi, saying he's ""confident Dara will find a way forward."""
"The company is raising the prices on its standard and premium streaming subscription services. The standard service, which allows customers to stream shows and movies in HD on up to two screens at once, is now priced at $10.99 monthly, up from $9.99. The premium service, which provides viewing on up to four screens (plus ultra HD content access), is $13.99, up from $11.99. The basic service, which enables Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) streaming on one screen and doesn't allow for HD or ultra HD viewing, will remain at $7.99. Related: Why we started companies here But the price change, first reported by Mashable, won't impact existing members yet. According to a Netflix spokesperson, users will be notified of the new prices based on their billing cycle and will get 30 days notice before the changes takes effect.

The increases come as the company pours more money into developing original programming. The company has committed $15.7 billion to streaming content deals -- with $6 billion earmarked for 2017 alone. Last year, Netflix raised its standard HD plan to $9.99 per month, up from $8.99. Netflix has treaded lightly with price increases since 2011, when it suddenly hiked prices 60% for streaming and DVD-by-mail subscribers."
"The ride-hailing behemoth's directors on Tuesday unanimously approved a host of changes to the way Uber will be run. Among them, the already massive board of 11 will increase by six members, according to a person familiar with the board's decision. Also, board members will all vote on an equal scale. The changes serve three main purposes: 1) They reduce Kalanick's grip on the company. 2) They pave the way for a large investment from Japanese tech conglomerate Softbank (SFTBF). 3) They help prepare Uber for an initial public stock offering by September 2019. Adding board members -- two for Softbank, plus four independent directors, including a new independent chair -- blunts Kalanick's influence. He was ousted from the company's helm earlier this year after a series of crises, though he maintained his board seat. Kalanick and another early investor, venture fund Benchmark Capital, are engaged in a bitter legal battle over his role at the company. The board voted Tuesday to require two-thirds of the directors' votes to approve a new chief executive, likely closing the door on any effort Kalanick might make to return as CEO. The new voting system adopted by the board is particularly damaging for Kalanick's influence: board members will now each have one vote per share, regardless of the class of shares they own. Kalanick and Benchmark own special shares held by early investors that previously gave them 10 times the number of votes of other board members. Related: Outsted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick shakes up board ""The board voted unanimously to move forward with the proposed investment by SoftBank and with governance changes that would strengthen its independence and ensure equality among all shareholders,"" Uber's directors said in a statement. The vote is a huge win for Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi. He was able to calm a tumultuous storm brewing in the company's board and secure one of Uber's biggest-ever investments in just over a month on the job. Softbank has agreed to make an initial investment of between $1 billion and $1.25 billion in Uber, buying new shares to maintain the company's $69 billion valuation. It also committed to spend billions more purchasing between 14% and 17% of the company's shares already held by current stakeholders at a discounted rate. Pending the sale of those shares, Benchmark has agreed to drop its lawsuit against Kalanick.

Wyden also asked executives whether they are aware of any data breaches or security incidents in which a hacker accessed internal systems or data. The letter follows the Department of Homeland Security assessment that Russian hackers last year targeted as many as 21 states' election systems, none of which were involved in tallying votes. Some states dispute Homeland Security's findings. At the DEF CON Hacking Conference in July, security experts hacked a number of U.S. voting machines in less than 24 hours. The work demonstrated how easy it was to break in, and provided some solutions to fix the systems."
"The retail giant announced on Tuesday that it acquired startup Parcel, a delivery service that operates 24 hours a day. Parcel, which delivers groceries and other items from third-party retailers, intends to help Walmart with last-mile delivery, known as the final steps in getting packages to consumers. ""We plan to leverage Parcel for last mile delivery to customers in New York City -- including same-day delivery -- for both general merchandise as well as fresh and frozen groceries from Walmart and Jet,"" Walmart said in a blog post about the deal. Walmart acquired Jet.com in 2016, an Amazon competitor that offers everything from fresh groceries to household supplies. Parcel already has experience delivering perishables to consumers, with clients that include meal-kit delivery businesses, as well as retail outlets like Bonobos, a Walmart-owned company. CEO Jesse Kaplan launched Parcel in 2014 to solve a very New York City problem. For residents without a doorman, the process of accepting packages when not at home can be difficult. Packages are often sent back to the post office, which tend to close in the early evening. If not picked up in a timely manner, packages are returned to retailers. Kaplan's idea was to have shipments delivered to Parcel's warehouse. The startup then schedules a time to deliver packages to your apartment when you're home -- for a small fee. The company will still offer delivery services to other companies aside from Walmart and its brands. Related: Walmart's Jet launches private label brand Walmart has continued to ramp up its online shopping business to compete with Amazon. In 2016, it bought Amazon rival Jet for $3 billion in cash.

A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Sep 28, 2017 at 8:03pm PDT  SpaceX has figured out a way to pay for the costly missions, according to Musk, but he shied away from giving specific numbers. The company thinks it can make enough money from its current business of launching satellites and servicing the International Space Station to finance its Mars ambitions. Musk's goal is to make the BFR reusable, which would significantly bring down the cost of launches.  Scott Hubbard, the former director of NASA's Ames Research Center and a director of the Planetary Society, said there's merit to that business plan. If SpaceX can indeed make BFR ""fully reusable,"" he said, ""the cost barrier to human Mars exploration could be significantly reduced."" Hubbard added that he'd like to see more information about how SpaceX's spaceship will support 100 human lives for the long journey to Mars -- which could last six to nine months.

"AlphaGo, a documentary about a Google computer program's victory over Korean Go champion Lee Sedol, opens on Friday in New York City and Los Angeles next month. Go is an ancient game in which players place black and white stones on a grid and win by claiming the most territory. AlphaGo, the Google program, and Sedol played a best-of-five series in Seoul, Korea in March 2016. The match drew worldwide media attention, especially in Asia, where the game is especially popular. Sedol entered the match expecting to win. AlphaGo had beaten a pro before, but not the world's very best. The matches were played on a tabletop board, and a Google representative placed AlphaGo's stones, after receiving directions on an adjacent computer monitor. The film arrives at a time when society worries if robots will one day take the jobs of humans -- or worse, make our species irrelevant. Related: Robots: Is your job at risk? Man versus machine conflicts are common in pop culture -- such as IBM's Watson beating Ken Jennings in Jeopardy in 2011, or IBM's Deep Blue beating Russian Gary Kasparov in chess in 1997. ""I for one welcome our new computer overlords,"" Jennings wrote under his Final Jeopardy answer as he lost to Watson. But the documentary highlights how battles of robots versus humans are actually struggles between humans. One side is represented by a man-made machine, such as Alpha, DeepBlue or Watson. If anyone is a new ""overlord,"" it's not computers, but those who program them. The filmmakers follow the artificial intelligence experts from Google's DeepMind lab who created AlphaGo. They nervously observe the match from a private room crowded with TV monitors. This human side of AlphaGo was hidden from the millions who watched live on TV and YouTube as AlphaGo defeated Sedol. These researchers, who are experts in the trendy field of artificial intelligence called deep learning, spent years creating AlphaGo. AlphaGo was first trained on 30 million moves from actual games of Go, so it could learn which ones were most likely to succeed. Then it played itself, testing different strategies. This process of trial and error helped it better understand the game. The Google team entered the showdown with Sedol knowing their creation was not perfect and might lose to a player of his caliber. Sedol, 34, has won 18 international championships. He became a professional Go player at age 12. When AlphaGo triumphs, Google's DeepMind's team -- with more than a dozen humans -- gathered around the board for a photo celebrating the accomplishment. ""It's natural that humans want humans to win, that's a natural response, but AlphaGo is human created,"" David Silver, the DeepMind programmer who led AlphaGo's development, explains during the film. ""Everything AlphaGo does is because a human has either created the data that it learns from, created the learning algorithm that learns from that data [or] created the search algorithm. All of these things come from humans."" Related: Google's AI just beat the world's best Go player AlphaGo couldn't win, or even exist, without the help of humans. But that hasn't halted society's tendency to be wary of powerful new technology. During the film, Sedol discusses how he heard of celebration in the streets that he -- a human -- won one of the match's five games. ""People felt helplessness and fear. It seemed we humans are so weak and fragile,"" Sedol said. ""And this victory meant we could still hold our own."" Those human insecurities surface elsewhere in the film. Fan Hui, a European-based Go champion in Europe, plays an earlier version of AlphaGo and loses. He's deeply troubled by the defeat. But later, Hui teams up with the Google team to help develop AlphaGo. He continued playing AlphaGo, testing strategies to reveal its weaknesses. He then shared his findings with AlphaGo's creators to improve the system. As the film explores the conflict of humans versus machines, it has a lingering message: Humans won't become obsolete. Those who learn to work with machines are more powerful than ever. Ultimately, Sedol's lost to AlphaGo helped him see the game in a new way. ""He improved through this machine. His humanness was expanded after playing this inanimate creation,"" reporter Cade Metz, who covered the match for Wired, notes in the film. ""The hope is that machine and in particular the technologies behind it can have the same effect with all of us."""
"Collaborating would mean normalizing the ""hate and bigotry"" she believes the Trump administration represents, Saujani wrote in an op-ed published by The New York Times on Thursday.

"The 22-year-old senior from the University of Washington is running a company called NASTEA & Co., which sells dirty chai beverages. When she graduates next year, she may no longer be able to stay in the country to run her business. Originally from Taiwan, Tuan moved to the United States for high school when she was 15. And while other countries, including France and Canada, have special visas intended to encourage entrepreneurs, the United States does not. People who come to the country and start companies have to navigate a complicated web of existing visas, like the H-1B. The H-1B requires individuals to work under the control of an employer, making it difficult to launch a company. In 2017, the Obama administration instituted the International Entrepreneurs Rule as a solution. Foreigners building ""fast-growing businesses"" could apply for ""parole status"" to work in the United States. Typically, parole status is otherwise granted only to people who do humanitarian or medical relief. The rule was slated to go into effect July 17. But the Department of Homeland Security issued a memo one week prior that pushed the launch to March 14, 2018. In addition, Homeland Security said it would propose to rescind the rule entirely. The delay is being challenged by the National Venture Capital Association, which filed a lawsuit against DHS last month. At issue is whether Homeland Security needed to issue a formal ""notice-and-comment"" period before delaying the rule, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. Last Friday, the venture capital group asked a federal judge to issue a preliminary injunction that the rule be implemented immediately. The judge called a hearing for October 20. Related: Girls Who Code founder on why she shunned Ivanka, White House A Homeland Security spokesman said the agency does not comment on pending litigation as a matter of policy. ""However, lack of comment should not be construed as agreement or stipulation with any of the allegations,"" the spokesman said in a statement. The move by the Trump administration left entrepreneurs feeling blindsided. ""Our immediate reaction was: What is our backup plan?"" said Tuan. Tuan will be able to stay in the U.S. until June 2019 under an extension of her student visa known as an OPT. But her co-founder, Minnie Yuan, is facing a more urgent situation. Her OPT expires in June 2018. The two launched NASTEA in April as a class project. Within two months, they sold 700 bottles at $5 each, Tuan said. Their tea -- ""white coffee dirty chai"" -- is now available in four stores and sold online in six packs. The drink is made at their commercial kitchen space in west Seattle. They are expected to launch more flavors in the coming weeks. Related: 'Startup visa' alternative delayed by Trump Yuan has decided to apply to business school to buy more time on a student visa.

The move to add more voice assistants to a smart speaker has potential to increase consumer adoption of smart home products if they're able to work together. This could help Sonos stand out in a crowded market. ""[Companies want] to lock you into their ecosystem. ... right now, the whole experience is really frustrating I think for customers,"" Sonos CMO Joy Howard told CNN Tech. ""We're [creating] a platform that's open so that you can choose what voice assistant you want to use."" One of the biggest challenges of the smart home industry is how many products are siloed. For example, some devices are only accessible with Apple HomeKit, which means if you use an Amazon Echo, you'd have to switch to Siri for a task like turning off the lights. This is slowly starting to change. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) recently announced a partnership with Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), which will allow their respective voice assistants to communicate with each other. Related: Alexa, shut up: Raging against the new machines Sonos also announced a software upgrade for existing devices to make them Alexa compatible. But you'll need an Alexa-enabled device like an Echo Dot for it to work.

The Sonos One will launch on October 24 worldwide."
"Wearing a top hat, monocle, and white mustache, the character sat directly behind former Equifax (EFX) CEO Richard Smith as he testified before the committee on Wednesday. The ruse was organized by progressive nonprofits Public Citizen and Americans for Financial Reform. The organizations want to raise awareness of Equifax's forced arbitration clauses in their terms of service. Amanda Werner, Campaign Manager with Americans for Financial Reform and Public Citizen, played the role of the iconic Monopoly Man on Wednesday. ""I am dressed as the Monopoly Man to call attention to Equifax and Wells Fargo's use of forced arbitration as a get-out-of-jail-free card for massive misconduct,"" Werner said in a Twitter message to CNN Tech. ""They use these ripoff clauses buried in the fine print to ensure that consumers can't join together to hold them accountable in court."" Werner's character attracted a lot of attention on Twitter, due in part to the selected seat right behind the former Equifax executive. Last month, Equifax announced a huge data breach affecting over 145 million people. Hackers stole names, dates of birth, addresses, social security cards, and some credit card numbers through a hole in Equifax's software left open for months after the vulnerability was disclosed.

The fine print initially included an arbitration clause to prevent people from suing or joining a class-action lawsuit. It removed arbitration from its identity theft protection offering after outrage following the data breach, but still has it in other consumer products. Smith told Senators on Wednesday that a forced arbitration clause was not designed to be applied to the breach. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, grilled Smith over forced arbitration in the fine print of the company's products on Wednesday. ""I can't understand why you think for those 145 million in that case that forced arbitration is unfair, but in other uses in your company you think it's fair,"" he said.

"Three billion accounts at Yahoo were affected by a massive hack in 2013, the internet firm's parent company, Verizon (VZ, Tech30), revealed Tuesday. That's up from the roughly one billion when Yahoo first revealed the breach last year. The latest disclosure cements Yahoo's place at the top of a long and ignominious list of massive security breaches: Related: Why major hacks will keep happening Yahoo Yahoo gets the top two spots on any list of security breaches. In September 2016, Yahoo said that data associated with at least 500 million accounts had been stolen. Three months later, it disclosed a second breach -- the one that's now been revealed to have affected all three billion customer accounts that existed at the time. Revealed: Every single Yahoo account was hacked Verizon said it revised up the number ""following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts."" The epic security breaches were costly for Yahoo: Verizon slashed the price of its deal to buy Yahoo by $350 million and former CEO Marissa Mayer lost out on her cash bonus. Two Russian spies were indicted over the smaller of the two hacks. It's still unclear who was behind the bigger attack.  Myspace Yahoo isn't the only aging internet company to suffer humiliation at the hands of hackers. Last year, Myspace confirmed a breach of user names and passwords for about 360 million accounts. The company attributed the breach to a Russian hacker who goes by the name Peace.

"The LG K7i, launched by the South Korean firm at the India Mobile Congress this week, is embedded with technology that it says will keep mosquitoes away. It emits ultrasonic waves from a mesh grid on the back of the phone. The waves should repel the pests and are ""absolutely safe and harmless for humans,"" the company said. Some other LG products such air conditioners and TVs are already available with the ""mosquito-away"" technology. There are also apps that claim to use similar technology with similar results, but LG says this is the first time it has been embedded in a smartphone. The K7i Android phone has a price tag of 7,990 rupees ($122). LG says it is considering plans to roll it out in other countries.

"Whole Foods Market -- which was recently acquired by tech giant Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) -- said Thursday that hackers were able to gain access to credit card information for customers who made purchases at some of its in-store taprooms and restaurants. The company did not disclose details about the locations that were targeted or how many customers might have been effected. The tap rooms and restaurants use different payment systems than Whole Foods check-out counters, the company said. ""Amazon.com systems do not connect to these systems,"" the company clarified in a press release. Amazon did not return a request for comment. ""When Whole Foods Market learned of this, the company launched an investigation, obtained the help of a leading cyber security forensics firm, contacted law enforcement, and is taking appropriate measures to address the issue,"" the company said. Whole Foods says it plans to provide updates throughout the investigation. Related: Sonic customer info likely targeted by hackers Hackers targeted ""point of sale systems"" -- or the machines where customers swipe or insert their cards -- in order to steal the data, according to the press release. Sound familiar? The news comes just one day after reports that Sonic (SONC), the drive-in restaurant chain, suffered a strikingly similar problem. KrebsOnSecurity, a notable cybersecurity blog, had identified a potential breach at some Sonic restaurants that was likely executed the same way Whole Foods says it was hacked -- remotely via point of sale systems. Krebs estimates millions of credit and debit card numbers could have been stolen in that hack. Two other restaurants -- Wendy's (WEN) and Chipotle (CMG) -- suffered breaches earlier this year for similar reasons. Wendy's said in July that point of sale systems at more than 1,000 of its U.S. restaurants were targeted by hackers, compromising an unknown number of credit and debit cards. Equifax data breach: What you need to know Chipotle was hit in March and April. The company said in May that ""most, but not all"" of its restaurants may have been involved in a credit-card theft scheme carried out by hackers who installed malware on cash registers. The Whole Foods breach also follows one of the most high-profile data breaches in history. Just weeks ago, credit reporting bureau Equifax (EFX) admitted that hackers were able to gain access to personal information for as many as 143 million Americans. That breach went beyond stolen credit card numbers -- it put large numbers of individuals at risk for identity theft. Major corporations that have faced large data breaches in recent years include Yahoo, Verizon, Walmart, Anthem, Myspace and LinkedIn."
"Well, Instagram is trying to rein in the trolls in its corner of the internet. The Facebook-owned photo sharing app introduced a comment-control tool this week in a bid to grapple with harassment on its platform and curb online vitriol. Individuals with public Instagram accounts will now have a handful of filtering options for comments. They can allow comments from: Everyone, people you follow and your followers, just people you follow, or just your followers. Comments can also be blocked from specific users. While it may seem like just another service update, it is important step in the broader context of social media's big online harassment problem. And it is, in fact, a huge issue for internet users. Pew Research Center recently reported online abuse is as rampant as ever, with four in 10 U.S. adults saying they've been harassed online. Meanwhile, 18% of that group said physical threats, stalking or sexual harassment were part of the harassment. The ability to filter commenters on Instagram won't eradicate the internet's trolling problem. But some experts say it's a step in the right direction. ""As lawyers for individuals targeted by trolls, perverts, as*****s, and psychos, we've known how rife the Instagram comment section is for our client base,"" Carrie Goldberg, an attorney who specializes in sexual harassment crimes, told CNN Tech. Related: One man's approach to confront his online harassers: empathy The new tool could stave off harassment before it starts, according to Goldberg. ""The company does not have to spend its resources moderating abuse when users can curtail it before it happens in the first place."" Zoe Quinn, a game developer who wrote about her personal experience being harassed online in a new book ""Crash Override,"" says she'll take advantage of the feature. ""I'm relieved to know I can finally do something about a few bad actors on my own account,"" she told CNN Tech, adding that giving people ""granular and specific control over their privacy settings is great practice in general."" Instagram's tactic for helping users filter their feeds isn't exactly groundbreaking. The strategy is one parent company Facebook also uses. Facebook users can filter who sees their profiles and posts, as well as who is able to comment. Facebook, as well as other platforms like Twitter, rely on users to report misbehavior. A team of moderators then investigates claims that have been submitted. The comment-control tool isn't a panacea. Experts say there are drawbacks because it places the onus too squarely on the user. Others say it could create a false sense of security. Brianna Wu, another game developer who has been a frequent target of online harassment, including death threats, explained to CNN Tech that if an Instagram account is dedicated to ""doxxing"" women -- a term that refers to publishing the private or identifying information about someone for malicious purposes -- blocking that content doesn't prevent it from existing and spreading. ""The danger is going to still exist. You have to have user oversight,"" she said. ""It's also psychologically exhausting to curate death threats and rape threats yourself. You can block them, but new accounts spring up like weeds ... It's my experience when you draw a boundary with someone, they often double down."" Related: Instagram's new tools scrub nasty comments and spam Soraya Chemaly, a writer and director of the Women's Media Center Speech Project, agreed. ""I know that they try hard to make sure users have tools at their disposal that enable them to develop more privacy which I think is a net good,"" said Chemaly, while adding that the tools themselves don't really protect anyone. ""It just makes the experience a little more pleasant."" Instagram also provides the ability to filter comments in a few other languages. It added the ability to block select offensive comments in English in June. This week, the company said that's now available in other languages, too: Arabic, French, German and Portuguese. Chemaly said the issue of online harassment on social platforms is complicated. ""There's a question of, what's at the root of the hostility, that no one really addresses ... It's a larger issue of social and emotional learning."" So, while Instagram may be sending a message to trolls that it's platform is getting a little less friendly to their vitriol, ""there's really no stemming the firehose of awful human beings online,"" added Chemaly. ""It's like playing whack-a-mole."" Danielle Citron, a cyber-harassment expert and law professor at the University of Maryland, said the comment-control tool is similar to those used by some blogging platforms, where people can delete or block individuals who are abusive or off-topic. If privacy and safety folks collaborate with engineers when building a product from the ground up, features like this might be available from the get-go ""rather than trying to tack on privacy and security later,"" Citron said."
"Just over 90% of all cell sites in Puerto Rico were still out of service as of Thursday, according to the most recent report from the Federal Communications Commission. In each of the island's 78 municipalities, at least 75% of cell sites down. This has only made an incredibly difficult situation even harder. Millions of Americans island must struggle to stay in touch with loved ones and get access to important information. Cell phone companies have sent emergency equipment and engineering crews by planes and barges to the island to address the communications crisis, but they are facing greater obstacles to restore cell service. ""Maria created restoration challenges unlike those we've seen in other storms,"" Joan Marsh, executive VP of regulatory and state external affairs for AT&T (T, Tech30), wrote in a blog post Thursday. (AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending regulatory approval.) Among the daunting list of challenges highlighted by various companies this week: an island-wide power outage, extensive damage done to fiber connections, and logistical issues getting satellite trucks to the island. Related: What cell phone companies are doing to restore service in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Irma, for example, Marsh says AT&T was able to ""provide a big shot in the arm"" to the worst hit areas of the Florida Keys by sending in trucks with satellite and cell equipment. But there are only limited options to fly these trucks to Puerto Rico, and shipping by sea takes longer. ""We currently have three Satellite trucks on a FEMA barge due to land next week and three more on the way [Thursday] morning,"" Marsh says. There are also sincere safety concerns, as fuel needed for generators gets stolen and workers risk being held up at gunpoint on the roads. ""Security is a very serious issue on the island and is causing delays for all telecommunications companies,"" a spokesperson for T-Mobile told CNN. ""It's a very serious and sad situation.""

"The tech giant said it received between 13,250 and 13,499 U.S. national security orders during the first half of the year, according to its transparency report released on Thursday. It received four times as many requests as the same period last year -- and this year's numbers are the highest since the company started publishing biannual reports in 2013. The reports highlight how often government agencies and private entities request information from Apple. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) said these requests range from law enforcement helping customers find stolen devices to emergency situations where there is imminent harm to a person. The types of legal processes Apple receives from the U.S. can include subpoenas, court orders and search warrants. Related: How secure is iPhone X's new Face ID tech? ""We believe our customers have a right to understand how their personal data is managed and protected,"" Apple said in the report. It's unclear why there was such a big jump in requests.

Last year, the company opposed a judge's order to assist the FBI with breaking into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, saying it was ""an overreach by the U.S. government."" Related: Senator Al Franken raises concerns over iPhone X's Face ID It was also a banner year for Google (GOOG) and government requests.

A national security letter is a request for information that the FBI or other agencies in the Executive Branch can make when conducting national security investigations. Overall in the U.S., Google received nearly 17,000 data requests for the first half of the year -- its all-time high. During the same time a year ago, it received about 14,000 data requests. ""We continue to believe that this type of transparency can inform the broader debate about the nature and scope of government surveillance laws and programs,"" Google wrote in a blog post."
"""We're living in the beginning of an era of mass targeted attacks,"" said Nate Fick, CEO of security firm Endgame. ""Things are bad and they're going to get worse."" In just the last month, we've learned of a data breach from credit agency Equifax affecting 143 million people, an intrusion into the SEC, and a hack at major accounting firm Deloitte. Almost 2 billion records were lost or stolen globally in the first half of 2017, according to security firm Gemalto, an increase of 164% over the previous six months. The spike in global cyberattacks is the result of a perfect storm. Some tools used by government hackers have become public, such as when the NSA hacking tools leaked online. And it's easier than ever for hackers to make sophisticated tools to spread malware, ransomware, or steal data from companies. Firms also frequently fail to patch holes in their systems, at least in a timely manner. ""It's increasingly easy for essentially anybody to wield the kind of capability that used to be reserved for nation-states, or required nation-state level of expertise and investment,"" Fick said. Attacks by nation-states are undertaken by hackers working for a government, rather than a criminal enterprise. No one has attributed the Equifax (EFX) hack to anyone, yet. But law enforcement has blamed nation-states for other high-profile cyberattacks such as WannaCry. In that case earlier this year, intelligence agencies linked the massive ransomware attack to North Korea. It infected about 300,000 computers in 150 countries. Related: Equifax's legal and government troubles keep piling up According to Andrea Little Limbago, Chief Social Scientist at Endgame, cyberattacks will continue as geopolitical tensions escalate. In the past, nation-state hacks didn't have widespread collateral damage. In 2010, the Stuxnet worm damaged Iran's nuclear program, but Limbago said it was mostly contained. Fast forward to 2017: The sophisticated NotPetya cyberattack, which Ukraine blamed on Russia, targeted Ukrainian tax software in June, but infected companies around the globe. FedEx said the attack cost the company $300 million. Sophisticated attacks are a threat, but the biggest hacks can be the result of known vulnerabilities that don't get fixed in time. Hackers infiltrated Equifax through a flaw in a tool called Apache Struts, which is used to build web applications. The flaw was identified and disclosed in March, but Equifax's machines were not all updated and protected even months later, allowing the hackers entry. According to Kelly Shortridge, product manager at Security Scorecard, many companies don't maintain basic security hygiene to prevent cyberattacks. That includes regularly updating and patching computers, implementing mandatory two-factor authentication, and training employees to recognize phishing attempts. ""Unfortunately you can't just put a security box on the network and everything will be solved,"" she said. ""You have to be rigorous in monitoring, and rigorously prioritize how you protect your assets."" Keeping computers up-to-date costs time, money, and expertise -- sometimes patching a server means taking it offline, potentially affecting customers or business operations. Skipping a patch over financial concerns could lead to a more expensive data breach in the future. Data breaches, digital extortion, and identity theft are lucrative. According to research from Symantec, the average ransomware attack -- where hackers take control of a victim's computer and then demand money to return it -- made $1,077 last year, a 266% increase from the year before. Hackers buy and sell hacking tools, malware, and stolen identities on the dark web. Related: A smart fish tank left a casino vulnerable to hackers Sometimes stolen data doesn't need to be hacked. As we've seen multiple times this year, databases that are insecure due to human error can leave private data exposed to anyone who searches for it. The number of devices vulnerable to an attack is growing. As millions of devices like smart coffee makers and connected light bulbs come online, there will be more opportunities for hackers to infiltrate homes and businesses. For example, hackers recently tried to steal data from a North American casino through a fish tank connected to the internet. They managed to compromise the tank and send data to a device in Finland. Insecure devices are like unlocked doors into networks; if a hacker accesses one, they could move around the rest of the system and potentially steal private information. Gartner estimates over 20 billion ""internet of things"" devices will be in use by 2020, up from an estimated 8.4 billion this year. Experts say many IoT manufacturers are notorious for shortchanging security and putting users at risk. Shortridge says the Equifax breach may be a wake up call for businesses who don't prioritize security. Government agencies and members of Congress are currently investigating Equifax. However, Fick said there's a lack of accountability when data breaches happen. The CEO of Equifax ""retired"" this week, following the retirement of the company's chief information officer and chief security officer. ""If you're the CEO or you're a board member, whether or not a breach is your fault, it's unequivocally your responsibility,"" Fick said. ""You should be fired if it's egregious enough. You shouldn't be allowed to retire."""
"Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) revealed Thursday that it had 541,900 employees in the third quarter, up from a little more than 300,000 in the same period a year earlier. Put another way: Amazon has added nearly a quarter million employees to its headcount in a single year. Part of that growth likely comes from its deal to acquire Whole Foods for $13.7 billion during the quarter. At the time the deal was announced, Whole Foods had about 87,000 employees. But Amazon also said at the beginning of this year that it would create 100,000 U.S. jobs as it staffs up fulfillment centers and hires customer service representatives. Amazon is currently weighing possible locations for its second headquarters to accommodate some of those employees. It received bids from 238 cities and regions across North America.

"The UAW, which is trying to organize at the upstart auto company, has asked the National Labor Relations Board to order the workers reinstated. Tesla says they were let go because of bad performance reviews. Other workers were intimidated, harassed and disciplined unfairly, the union says. It issued statements from what it said were union supporters at Tesla who were dismissed despite not having any problems on their reviews. ""I worked hard for this company for five years, sometimes 72 hours a week -- and never had any performance-related complaints,"" said Mike Williams, who the UAW says was fired for ""performance issues"" and being a bad influence on coworkers. ""I did, however, wear a union shirt,"" he said. ""And I had union stickers on my water bottle. And I believed that a union would make us safer, and would make the company more organized and more efficient."" The employees were fired or harassed over the past six months, according to the complaint. The union says hundreds of employees have been dismissed in that time, though it didn't say how many it contends were fired for supporting a union. About 33,000 people work at Tesla. CEO Elon Musk has sparred with the UAW repeatedly over the past year as the organizing movement has tried to take hold. But the company says no employee has ever been punished for supporting a union. Tesla would not comment on the reasons that any specific employees, including Williams, were dismissed. It calls the complaint an organizing tactic by the union. Related: Tesla could face an uphill slog in China ""At Tesla, we strive to be a fair and just company, the only kind worth being,"" the company said in a statement.

Tesla also faces a lawsuit in California state court claiming that it failed to provide two months' notice for layoffs as required by federal law. That suit, filed by a former employee, seeks two months' pay for the workers who were let go. Tesla says it is hiring to fill the ""vast majority"" of the positions left open by the terminations, and thus did not have to provide a notice of a layoff. It says the terminations took place in all areas of the company.

"The concept may sound a bit alarming, but the company says the service, called Amazon Key, for Amazon Prime members, is not only convenient but secure. Amazon Key is a two-part service with the Cloud Cam security camera and a compatible door lock. Users can let Amazon couriers into their homes while they are away and can keep watch through an app to make sure the drivers don't do anything besides deliver a package and leave. The Cloud Cam can be purchased separately, and collects and stores video clips for up to 30 days with a subscription. According to Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), couriers will be vetted with background checks and motor vehicle records reviews, and will only get access to homes once for each delivery. It's a pricey solution: $250 for the Amazon Key bundle, and security camera subscribers can pay for the Cloud Cam service starting at $69 per year. The move is a part of an effort to make deliveries easier for Amazon customers and keep packages safe from inclement weather or potential thieves. Walmart last month announced a similar service with smart lock company August. Critics say the benefits of the service, available starting next month in select markets, might not outweigh the potential privacy and security concerns. Not only will strangers and Amazon be entering your home, but it could become a target for hackers, too. ""I don't think people fully understand the ramifications of storing 24-hours of internal home surveillance video and audio that wouldn't necessarily equal what the tradeoffs are for convenience,"" says Katie Moussouris, founder of Luta Security. Related: Amazon will let delivery people inside your house People have long given up personal data in exchange for using products and services. For example, Facebook (FB, Tech30)is a free service that monetizes human data by selling targeted advertisements. Turning on location services on your phone lets maps and other apps track your whereabouts. Smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home are ""always-on"" listening devices that can connect to your calendar, Uber accounts, and more. The devices are triggered by a verbal command and act as your personal assistant. As companies provide more tech solutions to everyday problems -- such as not being home to sign for a package -- they're asking for permission to embed themselves deeper into our lives. ""We all have this tendency to decide what is worth it to us to give up some of that privacy,"" Moussouris said. ""Society is being steered right now by companies that see better ways to target ads or drive profit."" The data collected via Cloud Cam won't be used for advertising purposes or in other Amazon products, the company confirmed to CNN Tech. According to analyst Michael Pachter with Wedbush Securities, Amazon Key is a way to sell cameras. ""I believe this 'service' is a Trojan Horse to enter the home security market,"" Pachter said. ""If Amazon can convince 10% of its estimated 55 million U.S. Prime members to buy a camera and sign up for a home security [system], it will generate well over $1 billion in revenue initially. It could conceivably generate another $500 million or more annually in service revenue."" Related: Amazon's new plan aims to get teens hooked Although many consumers say they value privacy, some studies indicate that people will happily give that up for small incentives. According to research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, consumers are willing to relinquish privacy when offered incentives, or faced with additional steps to be more secure. In one part of the study, students were offered free pizza in exchange for friends' email addresses -- most students obliged. Further, when offered encryption on an account, a majority of the participants skipped setting up the privacy feature and chose an easier to implement but less secure option. There are also potential security concerns with Amazon Key that comes with adding an internet-connected device to the home. In 2016, the Mirai botnet, which is an an army of computers controlled by one hacker, used connected security cameras to take down major websites. Meanwhile, some hackers have been caught spying on people through webcams -- even built-in ones on Mac computers. If vulnerabilities are ever found in Amazon Key's software, a patch will have to go out quickly, Moussouris warned. Otherwise, the cameras could turn into a botnet, too. The Internet of Things is only growing -- as is Amazon's ecosystem of services. Research firm Gartner estimates there will be 20.4 billion IoT devices in use by 2020. With each new addition -- from books to groceries to Echo to Key -- the company is asking its consumers for both their trust and personal information. According to Vineetha Paruchuri, security researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, there's no perfect framework to help people make security decisions. And for some, the benefits and ease of use of smart technology are more important than the potential risks. ""A simple rule of thumb here could be to visualize the best case, average case, and worst case scenarios,"" Paruchuri said. ""See how each of those affect you, and [make] a call on whether you are equipped to deal with the fall out, and whether the tradeoffs are worth the convenience."""
"The CEO of General Motors appeared on Capitol Hill after a fatal flaw with an ignition switch. Even the CEO of Apple did it while facing scrutiny over the company's tax practices. But the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter are not testifying before Congress in the face of an unfolding crisis over Russian meddling in last year's election -- at least not yet. The tech companies are testifying in a series of three congressional hearings this week into how foreign nationals used social media to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. At the hearings, which began on Tuesday, lawmakers pressed the companies on fundamental questions about their immense power and inability to police their massive audiences. But these tough questions have not been directed at the CEOs who created and run these platforms. Instead, the companies are represented by their general counsels. Their glaring absence has caught the attention of members of Congress. ""I'm disappointed that you're here and not your CEOs,"" Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, said at a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. ""We would appreciate seeing the top people who are actually making the decisions."" Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, echoed the point at the same hearing. ""I wish that your CEOs would be here. They need to answer for this."" Some in the tech industry also pointed it out. ""Given the seriousness of the issue, it's shocking that @google, @facebook & @twitter choose to not send their CEOs,"" Jason Calacanis, an early Uber investor, said on Twitter. Related: Facebook, Twitter, Google defend their role in election Just because these CEOs are not testifying this week doesn't mean they won't be pressured to at a later date. Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook (FB, Tech30), directed CNN Tech to remarks last month from Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Burr said it was more important to get the ""person who's most capable of talking about the technical aspects"" than to get the CEO. ""The Facebook security and threat intelligence teams report up to [General Counsel] Colin Stretch, and Stretch has been very involved in the review of foreign interference on our platform,"" Stone said. Reps for Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Google (GOOG) did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ""Since this is an information gathering session, I think it makes sense to start with the legal counsel,"" said James Cakmak, an analyst who covers the three companies for Monness, Crespi, Hardt. ""If and when it comes to the next and higher level of discourse. ... I would suspect then the CEOs would be summoned to testify."" The tech execs have been remiss to go before Congress on other issues. House Republicans invited the CEOs of Facebook, Google and other tech companies to testify on net neutrality. The CEOs did not commit to appear and the hearing was postponed. While he did not attend, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey did tweet multiple times about the hearing on Tuesday. Google CEO Sundar Pichai did not post about it. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture of his family going trick-or-treating."
"It's called Vox Space, and a website for the company bills it as a subsidiary of Virgin Orbit that will work to offer launch services to ""the national security community of the USA and allied nations."" A LinkedIn page for Vox Space says it's based in Manhattan Beach, California and employs two to 10 people. The company's website went live to little fanfare. It was reported on earlier by Tech Crunch. Virgin Orbit has not made an official announcement, but when contacted by CNNMoney, a spokesperson shared a statement from Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart. ""At Virgin Orbit, we want to be responsive to the space launch goals of our government and the need to make more use of commercial services to further expand America's leadership in space,"" Hart said. He added that ""between Virgin Orbit and our subsidiary VOX Space, we are well positioned to serve all parts of the market."" Branson's Virgin Group has two space outfits: Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit. The former was founded in 2004, and its goal is to send paying customers to the edge of space on a spacecraft, called SpaceShipTwo, via a launcher plane, White Knight Two. That outfit suffered a major setback three years ago when a pilot was killed during a test flight. Only in recent months has Virgin Galactic said it's ready to resume powered test flights. Related: Virgin Galactic gears up for first powered test flights since deadly 2014 crash Virgin Orbit, on the other hand, is focused on sending small satellites to orbit via a modified Boeing 747, dubbed Cosmic Girl, and a rocket, called LauncherOne. Virgin Orbit says it's in the ""final stages of testing and preparation"" for the LauncherOne rocket. The small satellite launch market is a growing one. As satellite technologies become cheaper and private companies on Earth have found new, interesting uses for them, many are looking for cheap ways to get their devices into orbit. Virgin Orbit, along with several other commercial space startups, are looking to help meet this new demand. But cinching military launch contracts is a different beast. The U.S. government is very particular about which launch vehicles may carry sensitive national security payloads into orbit. Richard Branson to parents: Work from home, if you can Currently, there are only two companies that produce rockets that the U.S. government deems up to the task: Elon Musk's SpaceX and ULA, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). The launch of Vox Space is the first indication that Branson is interested in one day competing with SpaceX and ULA for a share of this market, which can be highly lucrative. The military can pay around $100 million or more per launch. Vox Space won't develop new technology. Rather, it's website says it'll focus on offering LauncherOne services to the government and ""ensuring our customers' critical information is protected."" Virgin's technology is much different than that of SpaceX and ULA. Instead of rockets that take off vertically from a launch pad, Virgin's plan is to launch rockets mid-air, from planes that lift off similarly to a commercial aircraft. One downside to Virgin's tech: It can't carry payloads much heavier than 400 pounds, or about the weight of a small piano. SpaceX's Flacon 9 rocket, however, is capable of carrying more than 50,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit or as much as 18,300 pounds to further places in orbit."
"Facebook (FB, Tech30) said Wednesday that sales topped $10 billion in the third quarter, up nearly 50% from the same quarter a year earlier, fueled by the continued strength of its advertising products. Its profits jumped 79% to $4.7 billion for the quarter. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg said profits will take a hit as the company invests more heavily in security. ""We're serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We're investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability,"" Zuckerberg said in a statement. ""Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits."" ""I wanted our investors to hear that directly from me,"" Zuckerberg said about the security investment, speaking on an earnings call. ""I believe that will make our society stronger."" The earnings report was released as a Facebook exec was testifying in the last of three hearings before Congress this week into how Russian actors used social media to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. ""I've expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tool to sow distrust,"" Zuckerberg said on the call. ""What they did is wrong and we are not going to stand for it."" ""I am dead serious about this,"" he added. Zuckerberg said protecting the security of the social network ""goes beyond elections."" It also means ""strengthening all our systems to prevent abuse"" At the hearings, Facebook, Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Google (GOOG) were pressed on whether they're even capable of preventing bad actors from taking advantage of their platforms through ads and regular posts. Related: Why aren't the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter testifying? Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, said at one hearing that Facebook had more than 10,000 people working on safety and security and would have more than 20,000 people working on those efforts by the end of 2018. It's unclear how many of those people will be full-time employees as opposed to contractors. Facebook CFO David Wehner said the current 10,000 figure includes ""employees at Facebook and also employees at partners."" Beyond the added headcount, Zuckerberg said Facebook is also investing more in engineering teams focused on security and artificial intelligence solutions. Zuckerberg stressed on the call that these investments aren't just important for the company and its users. ""It's part of our responsibility to society,"" he said. The drastic increase in security efforts highlights the challenge of policing an audience that numbers in the billions. Facebook now has 2.07 billion monthly users and 1.37 billion people who use the platform every day, according to its earnings report. ""Our community continues to grow and our business is doing well,"" Zuckerberg said in the statement. ""But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don't bring people closer together."" Facebook stock closed at an all-time high of $182.66 a share on Wednesday. Shares dipped slightly in after hours trading as Facebook execs teased plans to ramp up investments in security as well as video content and virtual reality. Facebook expects its total expenses for 2018 to jump as much as 60% from 2017."
"The electric carmaker issued its latest earnings report Wednesday, and the firm did little to assuage investors' concerns that Tesla would not be able to significantly ramp up Model 3 production in the near future. The company's stock price sunk more nearly 5% during after-hours trading. ""While we continue to make significant progress each week in fixing Model 3 bottlenecks, the nature of manufacturing challenges during a ramp such as this makes it difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for all bottlenecks to be cleared or when new ones will appear,"" the company said in a letter to investors. Tesla (TSLA) was already facing backlash from its shareholders over production of the Model 3, which is the first vehicle that's priced more for the average consumer at $35,000. At least one lawsuit has been filed by investors. Related: Tesla sued for Model 3 delays Tesla previously said it would make 1,500 Model 3's during the last quarter, but the firm dramatically undershot that goal. It churned out just 260, Tesla said earlier this month. The company said ""a handful"" of assembly lines had taken ""longer to activate than expected."" Based on figures in Tesla's latest earnings letter, the company isn't expecting to reach its initial goal of making 5,000 Model 3's per week before March 2018. Tesla, which rarely turns a profit, posted a net loss of $619 million for the quarter. Among investor worries: The Wall Street Journal reported on October 6, citing unnamed sources, that ""as recently as early September major portions of the Model 3"" were being built by hand. At the time, Tesla denied the report. ""Every vehicle manufacturing line in the world has both manual and automated processes,"" said the company's Tuesday statement. ""As we've always acknowledged, it will take time to fine-tune the line for higher volumes."" Production issues have been par for the course at Tesla practically since Day 1. Similar problems ramping up production also plagued the company's first two car models -- the Model S sedan and the Model X SUV. In July, as Tesla delivered the first batch of Model 3's to employees, Tesla CEO Elon Musk admitted the company went through ""production hell"" to bring all three of its cars to market. With a simpler, streamlined designed, the Model 3 was designed to make the manufacturing process easier. Musk said Wednesday things seem to be looking up for the vehicle's production. ""I was really depressed about 3 or 4 weeks ago. We were at level 9,"" Musk said, referring to how bad things were on a 1-to-10 scale. He added Tesla's now at an 8, and he sees smoother sailing ahead. Related: Tesla fired union supporters, UAW charges Tesla also admits that because ""the Model 3 production process will be vastly more automated than the production process of Model S, Model X [...] bringing this level of automation online is simply challenging in the early stages of the ramp."" Musk also said Wednesday that one of its current hangups stems from an issue with a subcontractor that ""really dropped the ball."" He said Tesla wasn't aware of the extent of the issues until very recently, and the company's engineers had to scramble to rewrite software from scratch to compensate for the contractor's error. Despite the production woes, Tesla has still had a phenomenal year in terms of stock performance. Its shares are up more than 50% so far in 2017. And the company says there's no signs of demand slowing down. ""We received record net orders for Model S and Model Xs"" last quarter, Tesla said in its earnings letter, which later added, ""Demand for Model 3 is not going to be a constraint for quite a long time."" Another bright spot in Tesla's report was that the company delivered its 250,000th car last quarter. That means there's now a total of a quarter million Teslas on the road. ""Five years ago, we had only delivered 2,500 cars. So the Tesla fleet has grown by a factor of 100 in five years,"" Musk said during an earnings call. --CNNMoney's Chris Isidore contributed to this report."
"The podcast, which kicks off its third season Wednesday, takes listeners inside the nuanced fundraising process. In each episode, released weekly, a different entrepreneur pitches their company to investors. The episode includes follow-up calls with both parties to see how deals made during the pitch session shake out. The podcast launched in 2015 and was acquired this year by Gimlet Media, the parent company behind other popular podcast series such as StartUp and Reply All. The concept aims to provide a realistic peek into the process of fundraising and the issues facing the tech industry, such as the lack of diversity. According to its host Josh Muccio, this season of The Pitch includes a diverse set of founders, including five founders of color and seven women on the cofounding teams of the 12 pitches. Last season, all of the startup founders were white and only three of the 12 companies had female cofounders. ""There are plenty of white, male founded companies that would probably get funding on our show, but we are looking at everyone,"" said Muccio. ""We think it's important to lead the charge in diversifying the companies with VC backing."" The selection process includes a mix of referrals from other investors and accelerators, as well as applications from the public. The startups span a range of industries and issues, from menstruation and mental health to recruitment for veterans. Investors must navigate these conversations, whether they're comfortable with the topic or not. When Claire Coder, founder of tampon supplier startup Aunt Flo, pitches her company, one male investor qualifies his understanding by telling her that he has two daughters. According to Muccio, a major draw for participating investors is for access to a ""different pond of companies outside the Silicon Valley echo chamber."" Coder, for example, is a 20-year-old founder based in Columbus, Ohio. Related: One man's approach to confront his online harassers About 25% of the startups featured last season received funding, according to Muccio. Deals often fall through during the due diligence phase, which is made clear during a follow-up portion of episode. Muccio and Gimlet Media don't get any cut of the deals made on the show. The Pitch landed on iTunes' top 20 chart of downloaded podcasts following its season two debut. It also hit the download charts in five countries. The latest season also features some controversial figures such as Miki Agrawal, co-founder and former CEO of Thinx. In March, Agrawal abruptly left the company amid allegations which included a sexual harassment claim, criticism for paying company below-standard wages and providing poor benefits. Agrawal addressed the controversy in a Medium post. She appears on The Pitch on behalf of her bidet attachment startup, Tushy. When asked by investors why she left her fast-growing company to focus on Tushy, she declines to talk about what happened, citing a gag order. One startup that piqued investors' attention is Shift, a recruiting pipeline to connect veterans to jobs. ""I am going to bring this to the White House,"" said investor Jillian Manus of Structure Capital. Other investors include Daniel Gulati, a partner at Comcast Ventures, and Phil Nadel, managing director of Forefront Venture Partners."
"We've only had the phone since Monday morning. It's more than the few minutes of hands-on time reporters had when the device was launched, but a day is not enough time to fairly review the iPhone X. It's like deciding if you want to marry someone after one blind date. So while we test, tinker and tap this week, here are some first impressions to whet your appetite, presented as yearbook superlatives: Most likely to annoy you Call it what you like -- a cutout or a notch -- but the area around the new front-facing cameras and sensors is definitely a black mark on the iPhone X's screen. In the battle over bezels (the frame around a smartphone screen), Apple seems to have gone a little too far to push its screen to the very edges of the device. If you watch a widescreen movie, you can shrink it down so everything is visible and get a box just barely larger than what you'd see on an iPhone 8 Plus. But if you double tap it to fill the screen, the black bar will block out a tiny bit of the image. The corners of the screen are also rounded, gently shaving off any corners of apps or content. In an era when all smartphones look nearly identical in their cases, you could argue the black bar gives the iPhone X screen a distinctive look. But I'd rather just watch my movie without a little gap in the display. Related: Apple's Jony Ive: Some people 'misuse' iPhones Hardest to warm up to Face detection is the iPhone X's signature feature. Setting it up is easier than adding a fingerprint. It works, but seems to slow down the unlocking process. It's one of those things I'll need more time to get used to before I decide if it's actually an improvement of just a gimmick to make the iPhone X seem futuristic enough to justify all the hype and that $1,000 price tag. Most attractive new addition It's you! Your face can now get the ""Portrait Mode"" treatment when using the front-facing camera. Also known as the ""selfie"" camera, it's now able to mimic the same shallow depth-of-field effect as the back camera. A perfect time-sucking addition for selfie fans. Related: iPhone X pre-orders up to a six week wait Oddest security issue Apple hopes you don't have an untrustworthy identical twin. The company says its face detection feature is far more secure than fingerprint sensors, with a one-in-a-million chance of someone fooling it. However, the company acknowledges that it can be tricked by identical twins. It's also not as effective for children under 13. That could be disappointing for any pre-teens planning to drop a thousand dollars on a smartphone. Most likely to be forgotten (a k a, The class clown) Ironically, the under-13 set is the group most likely to enjoy texting animated pieces of sentient poop to their pals. Apple's new Animoji feature uses the face detection technology to animate 12 popular emojis in Messages, including a robot, a unicorn, a pig and a fox. It's cute! Developers can use the same technology in their own apps. Snapchat is one of the first, with masks that map to your face. The Face ID camera has a ton of fun potential just waiting to be tapped by other apps, but I suspect the novelty of Apple's Animoji will wear off quickly. I could be wrong. We might be communicating entirely in animated emojis in five years, in which case I will apologize with an appropriately humbled animated unicorn head. Most delightful detail you'll never notice To set it apart from the iPhone 8, the back of the X has an ""optical layer"" that adds a subtle glimmer to the glass surface, which is designed to work with inductive charging devices. Unfortunately, if you break the glass on either side, it will cost more to replace on the iPhone X than previous models. You're safest keeping it in a case and missing out on the shine. Related: iPhone X screen repair: That'll be $275 Biggest inconvenience The new and improved Control Center was my favorite addition in iOS 11. But things have shifted on the iPhone X to work around the missing Home button. To bring up the control center, you need to tap and drag down from the top right corner of the screen. It's not thumb friendly, unless you have unusually long thumbs. When it appears, it's higher on the screen than when you swipe up. One clumsy workaround is to use the Reachability setting, which moves everything on the screen down. We're still testing out the phone and will be back later with a full review and a camera comparison. The iPhone X arrives in stores Friday. There's already a lengthy wait for online orders, but you might be able to get one in person at an Apple Store or retailer."
"Aibo, the artificial-intelligence-powered hound, wags its tail, chases pink balls and can learn new tricks like giving its owner a high five. Aibo is a rebooted version of a device Sony (SNE) first launched in the 1990s -- and the Japanese company has made it appealingly un-robotic. Unlike past versions, it has ""eyes"" (two small screens capable of showing diverse and nuanced expressions), a rounded appearance and a mouth that tilts up in a smile. Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai unveiled the new robotic pup in Tokyo on Wednesday. It will go on sale in Japan in January, priced at ?198,000 ($1,740) before tax.  With an app that connects it to a store, Aibo appears poised to eventually become a rival to smart speaker devices like Amazon's Alexa and Google Home. For now, the robotic pet is being billed as an affectionate companion -- one that hears and understands words of praise and eventually learns and remembers which actions make owners happy. With the owner's permission, Aibo can constantly upload and update data stored in the cloud, changing its personality over time. Related: Toyota wants this baby robot to be your friend Owners can also ask Aibo to take pictures. Wandering into creepy territory, the robotic pet can record everything it experiences and create a database of memories owners can browse through on the app. The gadget is a reminder of Sony's pioneering past in robotics and artificial intelligence. The electronics maker bred the first generation of Aibo -- short for Artificial Intelligence robot -- back in 1999. It hoped the pup would captivate customers and make them excited to interact with artificial intelligence. Related: Wild concepts on display at Japans' big car show At first, it was incredibly popular. All 3,000 available units sold out in 20 minutes online. Over the next few years, Sony launched two more Aibo generations, but interest waned as more affordable robots entered the market. Sony eventually neutered Aibo production facilities in 2006, leading to an exodus of robotics and AI expertise. Now, with global tech giants and other big companies charging into artificial intelligence, Sony is getting back in the game. Related: Google is still trying to kill the Echo and Siri The company has pumped resources into the technology, teaming up with U.S. firm Cogitai and launching a venture capital fund last year focused on investing in AI and robotics startups around the world.

"In a series of threaded tweets Friday night, founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said the social media platform would announce new rules centered on ""unwanted sexual advances, non-consensual nudity, hate symbols, violent groups, and tweets that glorifies violence."" ""We decided to take a more aggressive stance in our rules and how we enforce them,"" Dorsey tweeted. Dorsey did not give a timeline for when the new rules would be in place, but said they would drop in ""the next few weeks."" Twitter said in a statement to CNNMoney that they could not provide any more details on the timeline as of Saturday evening. Dorsey took time to reply to dozens of messages, many of them critical of the platform and skeptical of Dorsey's timing. 6/ We decided to take a more aggressive stance in our rules and how we enforce them.  7/ New rules around: unwanted sexual advances, non-consensual nudity, hate symbols, violent groups, and tweets that glorifies violence.  This week brought special attention to the social media platform. Actress Rose McGowan's Twitter account was temporarily blocked for violating Twitter polices. It said she tweeted a phone number. Related: Roger Goodell's wife used fake Twitter account to defend her But the actress had been very active on this social media platform in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. McGowan posted a number of tweets about the sexual harassment scandal surrounding the media titan Harvey Weinstein. On Thursday she tweeted that ""HW"" raped me. Twitter users reacted to her brief suspension from Twitter with a social media campaign for women to boycott. The hashtag #WomenBoycottTwitter became the number one global trend on the social media platform Friday. The boycott hashtag is just the latest criticism of Twitter. In recent years, users have demanded more action against hate speech and harassment. Many see the platform as a haven for online harassment. Twitter has attempted to respond before. Earlier this year, Twitter rolled out new tools preventing serial abusers from creating new accounts, a new ""safe search"" function and blocking potentially abusive and ""low-quality"" tweets from appearing in conversations. Related: Why Rose McGowan was blocked on Twitter However, Dorsey acknowledged that the platform has not done enough to combat harassment. ""We see voices being silenced on Twitter every day. We've been working to counteract this for the past 2 years,"" he wrote in the first tweet of his series. Dorsey also said Twitter is reconsidering its verification policies. The verification policy tease was not part of his twitter thread. A commenter replied to his thread asking why a white nationalist like Richard Spencer is verified on the platform. Why do you verify guys like Richard Spencer? What signal does that send? Who are you helping by doing that?  We're reconsidering our verification policies. Not as high a priority as enforcement, but it's up there  Dorsey said that Twitter will get to changing its verification process ""as soon as we can"" but are bound by ""limited resources"" that requires them to ""strictly prioritize."" ""We're reconsidering our verification policies. Not as high a priority as enforcement, but it's up there,"" he said. Public condemnation of Twitter's policies stems back several years. In 2015, Twitter said it updated its policy in an attempt to stop people from tweeting abusive and violent posts. At the time, Mark Cuban had called on Apple to ban Twitter and President Obama urged tech companies to make it harder for terrorist groups, such as ISIS, to ""avoid justice"" by using social media platforms. Related: #WomenBoycottTwitter protest erupts over Rose McGowan's suspension Some public figures, such as Martin Shkreli, the infamous former pharmaceutical executive, have been kicked off Twitter for ""targeted harassment"" after he made unwanted advances toward journalist Lauren Duca.

"It started as a reaction to McGowan's temporary suspension from Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) earlier this week and quickly escalated to the number one global trend on the social media platform on Friday as #WomenBoycottTwitter. The actress, known for the television series ""Charmed"" and the movie ""Scream,"" is on a growing list of woman that have accused Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of rape, abuse and other forms of misconduct and has been tweeting about the scandal. On Thursday, a spokeswoman for the disgraced movie mogul said, ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein."" McGowan instagrammed the notification she received from the company, adding: ""TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE."" #WomenBoycottTwitter Friday, October 13th. In solidarity w @rosemcgowan and all the victims of hate and harassment Twitter fails to support. https://t.co/G0my9EyKpQ  The social network responded with a tweet, stating that McGowan's account ""was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates our terms of service."" ""She had been tweeting powerfully about sexual harassment and bias in Hollywood, and her own experience as a survivor of sexual assault, and she spoke for many women who felt they couldn't,"" said Heidi N.

The idea behind the boycott is to show Twitter that silence they seem to prefer."" Moore suggested the boycott last 24 hours, and advised users to completely log out of the popular social media platform starting at midnight Eastern Daylight Time. She added that if folks want to keep tweeting they should amplify women's work and voices instead. McGowan joined in on the boycott, tweeting: ""At midnight we RISE.""

"Adam Mosseri, the Facebook (FB, Tech30) VP in charge of News Feed, was asked Tuesday whether he thought humanity would come to regret giving everyone the ability to publish content. ""It's super important to acknowledge that connecting everyone and giving everyone the ability to share is not necessarily always a good thing,"" Mosseri said during a conversation at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. ""I believe it will create more good than bad overall."" Mosseri added: ""In the end, I don't think we as a human race will regret the internet. But I do believe there will be costs of connecting the world."" The stark exchange followed a presentation by Mosseri on how Facebook is working to crack down on clickbait and the spread of misinformation on its platform in the wake of the 2016 elections. Facebook has removed tens of thousands of fake accounts spreading fake news stories. It has also been working with fact checkers to flag stories in News Feed and has been trying to provide additional perspectives on stories with Related Articles. Related: Facebook is making mistakes at an awkward time At the event on Tuesday, Facebook unveiled publisher guidelines for News Feed, collecting its standards for fake news, clickbait and more in one place. But the candid response from Mosseri highlights a more existential concern for Facebook that can't be tweaked or debugged: the harm Facebook unintentionally does by connecting the world. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO and cofounder, recently confronted a similar question. ""For those I hurt this year, I ask forgiveness and I will try to be better,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post for Yom Kippur last month. ""For the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, I ask forgiveness and I will work to do better."" Mosseri's appearance Tuesday also served as a reminder of the media's distrust and jitters about Facebook. Facebook set off a panic this week after testing a tweak to its product in six countries that would split the News Feed, effectively making it harder for publishers to reach readers without paying to promote their content. Mosseri stressed Tuesday that the test is just one of thousands Facebook conducts at any given time and there are no plans to roll this particular one out. ""I understand there is a decent amount of concern,"" he said. ""I think we could have communicated it better."""
"Coban Technologies, a Houston-based company that sells cameras to police departments, announced this week a new dashcam designed to use artificial intelligence to identify everything from people and vehicles to guns. The dashcam's features are currently limited, but the underlying technology sets the table for law enforcement to use advanced technology to make better sense of video data. Coban Technologies is following the Silicon Valley playbook of making its camera a platform. Third-party developers will be able to create specific capabilities for the camera, such as software that identifies weapons. ""There's no doubt there's value,"" Sgt. Daniel Gomez, who leads the Los Angeles Police Department's tactical technology section, told CNN Tech. ""We want to be on that journey with them to understand where they're going to go, and what they're going to do."" His department is testing one of the dashcams as a way to better serve the community. For example, Gomez envisions the LAPD using the smart dashcam to perform tasks such as analyzing traffic stops so that officers can be better trained. Gomez said the department might also incorporate facial recognition technology in the future, following a dialogue with the local community, over civil liberties concerns. One hurdle is that a dashboard-mounted camera doesn't always have a direct view of a person's face, which is necessary to identify those of interest. Coban plans to develop facial recognition technology for the camera in the near future. Related: A rare look inside LAPD's use of data Coban's technology is designed to work with up to six cameras, so police departments could choose to turn their vehicles into 360-degree cameras, making it easier to identify faces. Police vehicles today generally only have a single camera on the dashboard. The tech also allows for immediate, automated analysis of videos. For example, Coban is testing a feature that alerts officers when someone approaches their vehicle. The technology raises questions about privacy and the ""big brother"" nature of facial recognition technology. With a network of smart cameras, governments could potentially track the location of every citizen, even if they're not suspected of wrongdoing. Earlier this year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office issued a report critical of the FBI's use of facial recognition technology. But police departments, including Los Angeles, are interested in how artificial intelligence can help cut down on crime. The LAPD has over 3.3 million videos filmed from in-car cameras, and 2.5 million videos from body cameras, according to Gomez. Once the department finishes rolling out body cameras, it will collect about 8,500 videos from them per day. However, analyzing footage has historically been a lengthy process. Coban's technology would be instantaneous. Coban Technologies CEO Doug Dickerson said there's a waiting list of departments around the country who want to test the new dashcam. Los Angeles is an early adopter of new technologies such as drones and big data. The technology creates another way for police to automatically identify vehicles. Many use license-plate reading cameras today, but Coban's dashcam identifies vehicles even if a license plate can't be seen, allowing officers to focus on other tasks. ""There's no way there's enough human eyeballs and enough police officers to keep things safe on their own,"" said vice president Deepu Talla of tech company NVIDIA, a Coban dashcam partner. ""With one billion cameras coming to smart cities by 2020, you would need three billion people to watch these cameras. That's not a practical way to do this."""
"The commercial space outfit, headed by Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) CEO Jeff Bezos, took to Twitter to announced the BE-4 engine survived its first test fire. The rocket engine has been under development for more than six years, and a successful test fire confirms the engine is on track to become operational within the first couple years of the 2020s. The BE-4 is a big deal for Blue Origin, which plans to use it to power its New Glenn rocket -- a massive machine that will be capable of sending satellites into orbit and competing with Elon Musk's SpaceX and United Launch Alliance for launch contracts. First hotfire of our BE-4 engine is a success #GradatimFerociter pic.twitter.com/xuotdzfDjF It's also a big deal for the private space industry in general. Blue Origin CEO: We're taking tourists to space within 18 months The BE-4's stated goal is ""to end American dependence on the Russian-made RD-180 engine."" In addition to using the engine in its own rockets, Blue Origin hopes to sell the BE- 4 to United Launch Alliance -- a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) -- for use on its new rocket series, called Vulcan. Vulcan is the answer to an ongoing problem for ULA: Its Atlas V rocket relies on the Russian RD-180 engine, making the government wary of using the rocket for sensitive national security payloads. ULA does have an alternative. It currently produces a rocket called Delta IV, which uses American-made engines and has frequently been used to launch payloads for the U.S. military. But Delta IV is very expensive to manufacture -- nearly twice as expensive as SpaceX's Falcon 9 by some estimates. ULA is looking to retire the Delta IV and begin making the new Vulcan series, which will be more competitive with SpaceX price-wise. And, taking a page out of SpaceX's playbook, Vulcan rockets will be partially reusable. That means instead of discarding a rocket after a single launch, it'll be able to fly again and again, significantly reducing the price of a single launch."
"Cities responded with splashy PR campaigns to woo Amazon and its 50,000 well-paying jobs. But when it comes to the nitty-gritty details of what cities are offering, which are due Thursday, officials haven't been quite so forthcoming -- which could keep citizens in the dark about what cities are giving away until a deal is nearly done. ""The Amazon bid will be submitted by the Partnership under a confidentiality agreement that applies to all bidding cities,"" said City of Houston spokesman Alan Bernstein, referring to the Greater Houston Partnership, the local Chamber of Commerce. ""However the city is considering a public release of a general outline of the bid, if not some specifics."" Washington, D.C., released a public proposal for four possible development sites along with a video at a special website -- www.alexawhydc.com -- but declined to detail what incentives it might offer. Buffalo and Rochester, New York, which are submitting a joint bid, also stayed tight-lipped. ""Given the very competitive nature of the selection process, the submission team is at this time unable to unveil any specific details regarding the contents of the submission,"" the cities said in a statement. Related: Cities make last-ditch effort for Amazon's second headquarters Several cities are submitting their bids through local chambers of commerce, which are not subject to public records laws. Amazon itself is also insisting on secrecy, but only for information that it provides about its plans during the bidding process. ""While the existence of the Project is not confidential, certain aspects of the Project and details regarding the company are confidential, proprietary, and constitute trade secrets,"" the request for proposals reads. ""Amazon will deliver a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement for execution at the appropriate time."" An Amazon spokesperson clarified that these agreements do not restrict governments from talking about details of their bids. A few cities -- including Toronto; Irvine, California; and Worcester, Massachusetts -- have released their full proposals, totaling hundreds of pages. But most contain few details of incentives beyond existing development programs that apply to all companies. Actual negotiations over any further subsidies would likely happen behind closed doors. Secrecy isn't unusual for such negotiations. Initial public announcements of a new factory or a headquarters relocation, like Amazon's, are rare. (This year has seen a handful -- Toyota floated its search for new site earlier this year, and Foxconn announced it was coming to Wisconsin before even deciding which part of the state.) Very often, companies will work through site selection consultants, and local governments don't even know who they're dealing with before they've made the final round of bids. Consultants even have code names for projects to keep them under wraps. Why do they stay so hush-hush? Mark Williams, who runs a South Carolina-based site selection firm called Strategic Development Group, says that companies don't want to tip off competitors, vendors or even employees too long before they've made a final decision. But local jurisdictions often like to keep the process quiet, too, out of fears that the public will respond negatively without fully understanding how tax incentives work. ""The cities want to approve these incentives in a regimented, well thought-out process,"" Williams says. ""They don't want them to be approved in the press, because they're very complex."" Related: 8 cities fit for Amazon's second headquarters Some advocates have a problem with that. Greg LeRoy is president of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that pushes for greater transparency in economic development incentives, and has counted $1.1 billion that Amazon has received from state and local governments. He says that when negotiations are carried out in secret, cities will make all kinds of promises that citizens might disagree with. Usually incentive packages have to be approved in a public session, but sometimes with very little time for discussion. ""Secrecy on these deals is always a problem,"" LeRoy says. Skepticism around economic development incentives has grown over the years, particularly in hot cities that have experienced rising housing prices. In the case of Amazon, some governments aren't planning to pony up cash at all. Five cities in the Bay Area, including Oakland and San Francisco, are submitting a joint bid. At an event in Washington on Tuesday, Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf said that they had mutually decided not to offer any financial incentives. Elissa Silverman, a city council member in Washington, D.C., who has been skeptical of using tax breaks to attract companies, says she'd only be open to incentives to support community college programs that help local residents get Amazon's high-paying jobs, for example. ""I'm not totally against it, if we smartly craft a package that would serve Amazon and the city in general,"" Silverman says. Many smaller cities that raised their hands didn't offer much in the way of incentives. But they only have only a slim chance of attracting Amazon anyway. Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said she'd rather see the city invest in public infrastructure. ""We sent them a letter. We said, 'Hey, we'd love to have you,'"" Barry said. ""It's much more important for us to pass a $5.2 billion transit initiative than it is to worry about Amazon."" -- CNNMoney's Kaya Yurieff contributed to this report."
"Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), the parent company of Google, is leading a $1 billion investment round in Lyft, the two companies announced Thursday. Google previously invested in Lyft's chief rival, Uber. The influx of capital has the potential to further boost Lyft's momentum in the U.S. while Uber tries to recover from a year full of PR crises, executive changes and legal scrutiny. Lyft remains a distant second to Uber, both in terms of market share and valuation. The latest funding round values Lyft at $11 billion, up from a $7.5 billion valuation in April. Uber, by comparison, was last valued at $70 billion. It's also close to raising what could be more than $1 billion from SoftBank (SFTBF), a Japanese conglomerate. Alphabet invested in Lyft through CapitalG, its growth equity investment arm. David Lawee, a partner at CapitalG, will join Lyft's board. ""CapitalG is honored to work with Lyft's compelling founders and strong leadership team,"" Lawee said in a statement. ""Ridesharing is still in its early days and we look forward to seeing Lyft continue its impressive growth."" Related: As Uber stumbles, rivals mobilize abroad In 2013, Google invested $258 million in Uber through a different venture capital arm called Google Ventures, which was later rebranded under Alphabet as GV. Patrick Lenihan, a spokesman for Google, told CNN Tech these two investments are ""operated separately."" Translation: It's totally not awkward at all. Really. Google served as an early and powerful ally for Uber by investing a large sum, getting one of its top execs on the startup's board and promoting the app in Google Maps. The relationship began to crumble as Uber invested in self-driving cars, a key area of interest for Google, and Google began to experiment with ride-sharing, Uber's bread and butter. David Drummond, an SVP at Alphabet, left Uber's board in 2016 citing ""the overlap between the two companies."" This year, the two companies have faced off in court over allegations Uber used self-driving car technology stolen by a former Google employee. Even before the investment, Google had begun to align itself with Lyft. Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car division, has been working with Lyft on an autonomous car pilot program."
"Instead, police hit a dead end. State investigators say they still cannot access emails that could help them identify victimized kids or track down the ""very bad, bad people"" Davis admitted to contacting. Although Google tipped off cops about the child porn files that had crossed its network, the company refused to give them access to his Gmail account -- despite the fact that police had a search warrant. Google's argument: The data is ""out of jurisdiction."" In other words, some data in that Gmail account is stored on Google servers outside the United States -- and, since a ruling last year that is now before the Supreme Court, technology companies are not required to turn over that information. Since the legal decision, major technology companies such as Microsoft and Yahoo have begun defying judges' orders in criminal investigations, refusing to turn over potentially crucial digital evidence of crimes. Their actions are impeding hundreds of criminal investigations, according to public testimony to Congress and interviews with law enforcement officials by CNN. These cases include ones of human trafficking, drug smuggling, and fraud. ""This is a tremendous problem that is becoming more acute by the day,"" Brad Wiegmann, a deputy assistant attorney general, told members of a Senate judiciary subcommittee in May. ""These cases directly affect public safety and may even affect national security.""  In the Davis case, for instance, ""that account could contain a treasure chest of information to help identify other child pornographers,"" Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood told CNN in a statement. ""This is a man who pled guilty to exploiting innocent children, yet Google is more worried about protecting their own interests than the safety of our kids against child predators."" Google (GOOGL, Tech30), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), and other companies say they're caught amid a duty to their customers, clashing interpretations of an outdated American law, and increasingly stringent privacy laws abroad. ""In the absence of consistent legal doctrine, we're deferring to the judgment of the most senior federal court to rule on the issue,"" Google told CNN in a statement. Microsoft's deputy general counsel, David Howard, also issued a statement to CNN: ""This outdated law doesn't serve today's law enforcement needs, nor does it adequately protect people's privacy. We're particularly troubled that if the US government requires companies to turn over their customers' data abroad, other governments may follow this example and seek the private information of American people and businesses."" Until last year, technology companies routinely gave American law enforcement whatever information was listed in a search warrant, no matter where it was stored. But in a July 2016 decision, the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 1986 Stored Communications Act does not compel companies to give up data held abroad. The law does not directly address a reality few politicians at the time imagined: Today, for greater convenience, the American companies that dominate the global technology market have come to store our emails, documents, and other data on servers all around the world. The stalemate between technology companies and law enforcement is urgent enough that the Department of Justice is trying to resolve it through multiple avenues. On Monday, the Supreme Court decided to review the lower court ruling, a move that could keep the legal limits in place or return power back to police. The DOJ is simultaneously lobbying Congress to change the underlying law. Meanwhile, the tech industry's own proposal for an update to the law has become a bill that's now making its way through the House and Senate. Still, for now, American police who have lawful search warrants approved by judges are hitting a wall. Until the Supreme Court weighs in, or Congress changes the law, criminals have some cover. A fateful decision Technology companies store data all over the world. They've designed their systems that way to deliver data faster, or in some instances, to reroute signals in cases of traffic jams or downed networks. For a user in Belfast, Microsoft can house an MSN email account at its data center in Ireland, rather than the United States. Google keeps data in tiny ""shards"" all across its global network, so a single Gmail file might exist as fragments on computers in Belgium, Finland, and Hong Kong. The criminal investigations hitting roadblocks involve the data of not just American suspects, but often foreigners as well. Either way, those people's data can reside all over the world. But the data housed beyond American borders has taken on special meaning since a 2013 case in which Microsoft refused to help federal agents in an investigation of drug traffickers, denying them access to emails on computer servers in Dublin. Microsoft's lawyers argued that the 1986 Stored Communications Act did not, in fact, give police the right to seize information stored in another country without that foreign government's approval. The company eventually won before the federal appellate court in New York on July 14, 2016. The controversial ruling said the Stored Communications Act does not give American judges ""extraterritorial"" powers, and that therefore they cannot grant search warrants that reach outside the United States. A US judge could not demand that a company give up a video held on a European machine, for instance, even if it documented a crime committed by one American against another on American soil. In comments clarifying the decision later, the appellate court itself described the ultimate result as nonsensical. The ruling does not create ""a rational policy outcome,"" one judge concluded. And it ""severely restricted an essential investigative tool used thousands of times a year in important criminal investigations around the country,"" another judge on the appellate panel wrote. Since then, tech companies' refusal to comply with similar search warrants have set off legal battles in federal courthouses across the United States. The Senate Judiciary Committee, which is now reviewing the tech industry's version of a bill to resolve the problem, has heard about this issue firsthand from Wiegmann and others who want to see the law changed. DOJ officials have told Congress about a wide range of affected cases. In one instance, a man charged with child pornography cut off his electronic monitoring device and fled before his trial -- but Google would not give federal agents access to emails that could help track him down. In another, Google refused to provide emails concerning a drug trafficking investigation spanning Canada, China, and the United States. In yet another, Microsoft withheld data that could identify a suspected tax fraudster's accomplices. The problem extends to local and state investigations, too, according to Tennessee Bureau of Investigation special agent in charge Richard Littlehale. In California, investigators trying to track down a missing young girl -- feared dead -- couldn't access photos saved online that could help locate her. In federal cases in California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, prosecutors have argued that the ""Microsoft Ireland decision"" was wrongly decided. Magistrate judges in every one of those regions have sided with prosecutors and ordered the tech company to deliver data. Yet the companies have appealed, stalling investigations. In just the last few months, US district judges in D.C., Philadelphia, and San Francisco have stepped in to reaffirm those orders. But, to date, tech companies have not budged. Despite the cases underway across the country, the impasse has received scant media attention. The search warrants pertain to ongoing criminal investigations, so most of the court documents are sealed and kept secret from the public. But CNN has been able to glean some details by reviewing hundreds of pages of public legal documents and court transcripts. One effect of tech companies' resistance can be to delay investigations, as one case in eastern Pennsylvania shows. FBI agents are investigating how a person in the United States defrauded an American victim. On August 19, 2016, agents received a search warrant to obtain emails and files from the suspect's Gmail account. Google and the feds went back and forth for weeks. Google repeatedly told the FBI it had received the search warrant but didn't provide the data. When the company finally relented, it gave agents access to file folders -- that were mostly empty. In the end, 69 days passed before the company's attorneys finally called the FBI to explain the missing information: Google wouldn't be delivering the data, because it was on a foreign server. Other cases show the stalemate impeding justice in other ways -- for example, by limiting investigators to just bits and pieces of evidence. In San Francisco federal court last year, prosecutors asked Google to turn over emails in a case involving ""ongoing and wide ranging criminal activity."" After five months, Google turned over some emails, but the company withheld some attachments because they were stored outside the country. William Frentzen, a veteran federal prosecutor in the region's gangs task force, wrote that because of Google's refusal to comply, ""the government is restrained from investigating the full extent of the illicit activity and from identifying potential co-conspirators."" The Second Circuit ruling is even affecting cases where investigators already have evidence in hand. In August, a New York jury convicted Fabio Gasperini of computer hacking. His defense lawyer, Simone Bertollini, told CNN he'll try to get the appellate court -- the same one that ruled in the Microsoft case -- to toss out the conviction because the incriminatory emails likely came from a Google server in Europe. Law enforcement doesn't have an effective alternative strategy for getting this information. In a typical investigation, American cops can ask for a foreign government's cooperation through diplomatic channels -- a method called a mutual legal assistance treaty request, or MLAT. But investigators say the process is notoriously slow. And given that some companies' computer networks keep data in tiny bits that are always moving, it can be impossible for cops to know which country they should ask for help. Putting up a fight In court, prosecutors have pointed out that the technology companies do still have the option to give up data held abroad. They added that even the Second Circuit's decision, which allows them to withhold the data, is only binding in court cases in that circuit's states -- Connecticut, New York, and Vermont. Google, however, noted that it was following the guidance of the highest court to weigh in on the issue, and told CNN that ""production of users' data under a single federal law shouldn't depend on where in the country they live."" In other words, it should not be easier for federal agents to spy on the emails of someone in Oregon than on those of someone in Vermont. Some experts in technology law say the companies may see the refusal as a matter of protecting their public image. ""It's bad press for Google if they just acquiesced and didn't promote what is deemed as the privacy interests of their customers. This is particularly important for their international customer base. The idea of the US being able to reach anywhere to get anything is especially concerning to foreigners,"" said American University law professor Jennifer Daskal, who specializes in privacy and law enforcement access to data. Fears of the government's reach into private data have been particularly heightened since 2013, when leaks by National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed how US intelligence was tapping American technology companies to spy on users worldwide. ""After Snowden, there was a change in public trust of government access to data. And for a tech company, appealing to that change in public trust is important,"" said Fred Jennings, a tech and civil rights lawyer at the New York firm Tor Ekeland. In the wake of Snowden's disclosures, foreign governments, such as Brazil and the European Union, have adopted stricter data privacy laws. That, in turn, is giving tech companies even more reason to be resistant to US law enforcement. In court filings, the tech industry claims that responding to an American search warrant and pulling data out of foreign countries could break those new laws. The technology industry has banded together to stake out its position. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Cisco Systems (CSCO, Tech30), Microsoft, and Yahoo have filed joint legal briefs in courts nationwide to support Google's efforts to block federal search warrants. Even as the tech sector attempts to block these search warrants in court, it's also lobbying Congress to update the 1986 law in a way that would clarify their dealings with both American police and foreign customers. Technology companies have rallied behind the International Communications Privacy Act, which would draw a sharp distinction between ""US persons"" and foreigners. Under this legislation, tech companies would have to give police with warrants access to Americans' data, no matter where it's stored. ""Law enforcement requests for digital evidence should be based on the location and nationality of users, not the location of data,"" Google's general counsel Kent Walker said in a speech at the Heritage Foundation in June. But, according to the bill, if US officials want a foreigner's information, the foreign country would be notified first. If that country doesn't object, American police could access the data. Countries with legal systems the United States considers unjust would not have this veto power. Russia, for example, which is notorious for shielding its hackers from the FBI, would not have a way to block legitimate investigations. Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Christopher Coons of Delaware introduced the bipartisan bill in July. It's their second attempt, after a similar version in 2016 never made it out of committee. Despite its urgency about changing the law, however, the DOJ has surprised some observers by hesitating to publicly support the bill. Some suspect it's because the bill doesn't go far enough, putting limits on the ability of American police to obtain data on foreigners that didn't exist before the 2016 Microsoft-Ireland decision. ""The tech community has shown a greater willingness to move to the middle on this issue than has law enforcement, which appears to be banking on a Supreme Court reversal of the Microsoft decision,"" said Matt Whitlock, the press secretary for Sen. Hatch. Instead, the DOJ has asked Congress for a simpler fix: Give American judges those ""extraterritorial"" powers to force tech companies to move foreign data back to the United States. Meanwhile, even the proposed new bill is highly asymmetrical in what it permits US law enforcement versus that of other countries. American tech companies produce much of the world's most popular communication tools. Yet foreign police can't access any evidence kept by US tech companies to solve local crimes. For example, Brazilian federal police told CNN that WhatsApp is the preferred messaging service for drug traffickers and kidnappers there, but the company won't give them access to conversations. WhatsApp has claimed it does not have copies. But it would be illegal for WhatsApp to share them directly anyway. The Stored Communications Act -- the same outdated law frustrating police in the United States -- also blocks American tech companies from directly sharing information with foreign governments. Scholars and industry experts warn that ignoring international interests could come back to haunt the United States. Right now, America holds sway because its tech companies are powerful. But Chinese companies, for instance, are also making popular apps. Some of them will soon live on the phones of millions of Americans and store lots of their data. When that happens, American police will be at the mercy of Chinese laws. ""There's going to be some super cool Weibo app that we want on our phones, and it's going to cause headaches for US law enforcement,"" said Andrew Keane Woods, who teaches technology law at the University of Kentucky. ""There's a much more immediate need for us to play nice with countries."" For now, American investigators are impatiently waiting to see how this problem gets addressed. The Supreme Court could issue a landmark decision that once again gives American judges the ability to reach across borders -- or not. Either way, Congress could render any Supreme Court decision null and void if it changes the law. But that would require passing a bill that failed the last time around -- at a time when Congress has only grown more divided. -- CNN's Scott Glover contributed to this report."

"The credit reporting agency Experian (EXPGF) announced on Monday that users can now ask Amazon (AMZN, Tech30)'s voice-activated assistant to answer credit-related questions. With the new Experian skill, Alexa can tell users about their credit score and utilization, offer advice and -- for those who have access to Experian's credit lock product -- check whether their credit is locked, or lock it. To take advantage of the new product, customers first need to enable Alexa's Experian skill. Then, they have to enter their Experian username and password, plus a personal key created when users enter their information in order to link up their account. Users will have to repeat their pin after five minutes of inactivity. The new service might ring some alarm bells in light of the Equifax security breach, which exposed the personal information of up to 145.5 million people.

Square launched in 2009 with the goal of letting anyone with a mobile device process credit card payments. The payments method has become especially popular among small businesses like food trucks and boutique coffee shops. About 2 million merchants currently use Square. Now it wants to do the same for bigger businesses with Register.Square (SQ) said the new product helps larger sellers with tasks like managing big inventories and employees. ""The strategy is to bring [all] business needs to one place,"" Jesse Dorogusker, Square's head of hardware, told CNN Tech. ""The hardware, the software with no additional third-party tablets ... it's all from Square, it's all out of the box [and] as integrated as possible."" Related: Twitter CEO says new rules coming to curb harassment One advantage he pointed to is privacy. ""You're not necessarily going to give all [your employees] your iTunes ID [on your iPad]. So this is a way to build a dedicated business tool with a little less of the consumer access that other devices have,"" said Dorogusker. The company also believes the new hardware will help attract bigger businesses to its platform. Brick-and-mortar chains like Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream have been testing the hardware at select locations through a beta program. A Square spokesman said over 50 businesses are currently using Square Register, including Goa Taco, Cafe Grumpy and Best Beverage Catering."
"The company said Monday that it will spend as much as $8 billion on shows and movies in 2018, up from $6 billion earmarked for content this year. The boost in spending comes at a time when tech giants like Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30) are all using their sizable checkbooks to hunt for original shows and movies. ""We have a good head start, but our job is to improve Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) as rapidly as possible ... to stay ahead of the competition in the decades to come,"" the company said in its earnings release Monday. In particular, Netflix will be ramping up the number of original movies. Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said on an earnings call Monday that the company plans to release ""about 80"" films next year. Netflix's big bet on original content has helped it acquire and retain customers even as it seeks to raise prices and faces pushback from media partners. Related: Netflix wants to make it easier to binge-watch on planes The company added more than 5 million new members in the third quarter, with the vast majority of them coming from international markets. It now has 109 million subscribers, up from 86 million in the same quarter a year ago. Earlier this month, Netflix announced plans to raise prices on its standard and premium streaming subscription services. The change, set to go into effect later this year, will push the monthly cost of its most popular plan from $9.99 to $10.99. ""It's really about slow and steady. We've been in no hurry,"" David Wells, Netflix's CFO, said on the call when asked about the timing for the price hike. ""Many investors have sort of criticized us in the past for being under-priced."" Meanwhile, Netflix faces the threat of media companies removing content from its service. In August, Disney (DIS) said it would pull its movies from Netflix and launch its own streaming service. Still, Netflix forecast strong growth in the upcoming fourth quarter. It expects to add more than 6 million members worldwide, in line with Wall Street estimates. Netflix has doubled down on comedy with the recent release of a Jerry Seinfeld special. Mindhunter, a new series from director David Fincher, just came out. And the second season of Stranger Things, Netflix's breakout show, is scheduled to be released this month. During the quarter, Netflix also acquired a comic book publisher with the goal of using it to develop new films and series. The deal was the first acquisition in Netflix's history, but on the call executives sounded open to similar buys. At least one acquisition appears to be off the table: buying the beleaguered Weinstein Co. ""It'd be extremely unlikely for us to be a bidder for the firm,"" Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said on the call. Investor confidence in Netflix remains high. The stock topped $200 for the first time last week, and was up as much as 2% in after hours trading Monday following the earnings report"
"Teens have been flocking to the app -- named after the acronym frequently used in texts, ""to be honest"" -- to participate in anonymous polls and give feedback to friends. The app creators control the content of the polls, like ""Best person to go on a roadtrip with."" It's a measure that's meant to keep the sentiments expressed on the app positive, which is something that other anonymous apps have struggled with. The concept has spread like wildfire amongst teens. The app is designed for people who are 13 and older, and according to the company, over 5 million people have downloaded it in just the past few weeks. And it's only available on iOS for now. Related: Facebook's takeout tool brings Chipotle, Papa Johns to your doorstep On Monday, tbh announced it has also attracted the attention of Facebook -- which has acquired the company. The move isn't surprising given that the social media giant has shamelessly sought out teenagers in recent years amid reports that younger users are abandoning its platform in favor of newer apps and services. ""We were compelled by the ways [Facebook] could help us realize tbh's vision and bring it to more people,"" read a blog post from tbh, which has four cofounders. They wrote that the app's experience ""won't change."" It will, however, now have ""plenty more resources,"" it said. The app is just several months old. It first launched on August 3rd, 2017 in Georgia and is currently available only in 34 states to date ""to ensure the reliability of the app."" Facebook also confirmed the acquisition news to CNN Tech.

"But New York City is the latest city vying for the attention of tech giant Amazon. The deadline to submit a proposal for Amazon's second headquarters is rapidly approaching, and cities are making last-minute efforts to stand out. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has sent cities into a frenzy since announcing plans to open another headquarters in North America. Dubbed HQ2, the new facility will cost at least $5 billion to construct and operate, and will create as many as 50,000 jobs. The deadline to submit a proposal is Thursday. It's unclear how many cities have submitted proposals so far. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cities have made splashy and creative efforts to grab the company's attention. For example, Tuscon, Arizona sent a giant cactus to CEO Jeff Bezos and Stonecrest, Georgia offered to de-annex land and rename it the city of Amazon. In the last week, more cities have come forward with more out-of-the-box approaches. Related: 8 cities fit for Amazon's second headquarters Kansas City Mayor Sly James has given five-star reviews to 1,000 random items on Amazon's website. He also found a way to tie in Kansas City's strengths in each review. One was for $14.99 wind chimes. ""I'll tell you, when I'm sitting out in the backyard of my reasonably priced home in a safe neighborhood with great schools and these chimes start to tinkle, it feels like the whole world is singing just for me,"" the mayor wrote in the review. I bought 1,000 products for charity on Amazon and reviewed them all with a little KC love. Read all my reviews at https://t.co/fXuxqnmp3v pic.twitter.com/JBLHyiE51P ""We want to emphasize our innovative approach and this drove that message home,"" Mayor James told CNN Tech. ""At the bare minimum, more people are going to know more about Kansas City ... because of this effort."" The items purchased for the reviews will be donated to local charities across the city. On Wednesday night, several major New York City landmarks, like the Empire State Building and One World Trade, will temporarily light up in ""Amazon orange"" as a show of support for the city's official bid for the facility. Other cities are hoping attractive incentive packages will help. The Chula Vista City Council in the San Diego metropolitan area unanimously approved late Tuesday a $400 million incentive package that includes the opportunity to co-create California's next university. The city of Worcester, Massachusetts will offer Amazon up to $500 million in local property tax breaks spread out over 20 years, officials confirmed to CNN Tech. And if a new proposed law is passed, New Jersey said it could offer Amazon $5 billion in tax breaks over 20 years. Other representatives for cities would not reveal details of their proposals -- like tax incentives -- in order to maintain a competitive bid. Related: Cities are doing wacky things to host Amazon's second headquarters But at least one city won't be submitting a formal proposal for the site: San Antonio, Texas. In an open letter to Bezos dated Oct. 11, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg and Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff discussed the decision. ""We've long been impressed by Amazon and its bold view of the future. Given this, it's hard to imagine that a forward-looking company like Amazon hasn't already selected its preferred location,"" the letter said. ""And if that's the case, then this public process is, intentionally or not, creating a bidding war amongst states and cities."" Although San Antonio didn't make a formal bid, the letter lists several of the city's positive attributes and adds: ""If you choose to join a city of the future, we would love to have you in San Antonio."""
"But soon, students and other schools around Flathead County were receiving threatening messages, too. More than 30 schools in the district shutdown for three days. ""The messages weren't pleasant messages,"" Bradshaw said. ""They were 'splatter kids' blood in the hallways,' and things like that."" The U.S. Department of Education is now warning teachers, parents, and K-12 education staff of a cyberthreat targeting school districts across the country. So far, at least three states have been targeted by the extortion attempt from hackers asking schools to give them money or the group will release stolen private records, according to the department. ""In some cases, this has included threats of violence, shaming, or bullying the children unless payment is received,"" the department wrote in an advisory this week. Bradshaw, the superintendent of schools in Columbia Falls, Montana said a hacking group broke into multiple school servers and stole personal information on students and possibly staff. He said after the threatening messages came, hackers asked for ransom. In a ransom note sent to a number of Columbia Falls school district members and released by the county's sheriff's department, the hacking group called the Dark Overlord threatened the district and demanded up to $150,000 in bitcoin to destroy the stolen private data. The threatening letter talked about use of force, mentioned the name ""Sandy Hook,"" the elementary school in Connecticut where 20 small children and six adults were shot dead, and said victims would suffer financial and reputational damage. Law enforcement said they did not believe the threats and determined the attackers were located outside of the U.S. ""We feel this is important to allow our community to understand that the threats were not real, and were simply a tactic used by the cyber extortionists to facilitate their demand for money,"" the Flathead County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post last month. Bradshaw said the district is not paying the ransom, and he is still receiving threatening messages. Related: The U.S. Army is teaching kids how to hack at DEF CON The same hackers also targeted the Johnson Community School District in Iowa earlier this month, and the district canceled all classes on October 3. According to local media reports, the hackers also sent threatening text messages to children and their parents. The hacking group previously attempted to extort Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) after hacking its production studio, Larson Studios. The group released episodes of Orange is the New Black online last spring. It's unclear why the Dark Overlord began targeting schools but someone from the hacking group told the Daily Beast they are ""escalating the intensity of our strategy in response to the FBI's persistence in persuading clients away from us."" The Department of Education says the hackers are probably targeting districts ""with weak data security, or well-known vulnerabilities that enable the attackers to gain access to sensitive data."" It advises districts to conduct security audits and patch vulnerable systems, train staff on data security best practices, and review sensitive data to make sure no outside actors can access it. According to May Kavaney, the chief operating officer of the Global Cyber Alliance, school environments often don't have a lot of technology resources dedicated to security, but have some of the richest personal information on people, including social security numbers, birth dates, and, potentially, medical and financial information. ""If bad actors can access student [personal data], that information can be exploited for the purpose of fraud and committing crimes for years before it is detected,"" Kavaney says. ""It's often only upon application for a job, or application for financial aid to attend college that students find out that their social security number has been used fraudulently -- they may have poor credit due to false applications against their history, or worse, find that crime has been committed in their name."" Bradshaw says the ordeal has been stressful and troubling. Because the district hasn't paid the hackers, they're still threatening to release the data online. But, he said, the response from law enforcement and the Flathead County community has been positive. ""We still got people in this country that believe in one another, and it's been easier to get through than you would have thought,"" Bradshaw said. ""People care about people in this state."""
"Shares of Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) tumbled in midday trading Monday after reports that their widely rumored merger talks may be ending. It would mark yet another high-profile failure to combine the two carriers. SoftBank (SFTBF), a Japanese conglomerate with a majority stake in Sprint, is said to be calling off the negotiations due to concerns about the ownership structure of the combined business, according to reports from Nikkei and The Wall Street Journal. Reps for T-Mobile, Sprint and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sprint's stock fell as much as 11% in trading after the report. T-Mobile was down about 5%. Related: SoftBank: The new kingmaker in tech Sprint and T-Mobile previously gave up an attempt to merge in 2014 due to concerns about regulatory challenges from the Obama administration. But the companies expected to have a better shot at the merger this year under the Trump administration. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said in May that the Obama administration was ""quite tough on business,"" and added ""the door is open"" for potential mergers with the new administration. Son met with Trump the month before he took office to talk up an investment in U.S. businesses. The investment ignited speculation about Son and SoftBank trying to revive merger talks. A few weeks later, T-Mobile CEO John Legere said he was open to ""various forms of consolidation"" when asked about a potential merger with Sprint and SoftBank under the Trump administration."
"The Japanese video game maker ramped up its sales and profit forecasts on Monday as consumers race to buy its latest console, the Switch. Nintendo (NTDOF) said it now expects operating profit for the current financial year of 120 billion yen ($1.06 billion), nearly double the 65 billion yen ($572 million) it predicted three months ago. That would be its best performance since 2010 when smash hit devices like the Wii and DS were still selling well. When the Switch went on sale in March, the company said it couldn't ship enough devices to meet the huge demand. Those problems seem to be easing: Nintendo now expects to sell 14 million of the consoles for the year ending March 2018, up from its previous forecast of 10 million. Related: Nintendo's mini-sized classic console is coming back in 2018 And it's not just the hardware boosting the bottom line. ""Super Mario Odyssey"" -- Nintendo's latest installment of the gaming industry's best-selling franchise -- released Friday on the Switch to positive reviews. The company also tapped another of its classic titles -- ""The Legend of Zelda"" -- for the Switch back in April. Nintendo now forecasts sales of 50 million Switch games for the year, up from its previous estimate of 35 million. Related: Nintendo re-invents a gaming icon With the Switch, the Japanese company bet that gamers would be willing to part with their money for a hybrid device they can play both at home and on the move. It appears to have paid off. Analysts expect Nintendo to take advantage of the Switch's success to tap into the widespread popularity of mobile games. Chinese tech giant Tencent (TCEHY) has announced it will release a popular mobile game, ""Arena of Valor,"" for the console -- a big boost for Nintendo. ""The Nintendo Switch is at the vanguard of the firm's new strategy,"" brokerage firm Daiwa wrote in an investor's note on Friday, adding that the console will enable Nintendo ""to lay claim to a greater share of the mobile game market."" Related: Nintendo Switch sales are off to a roaring start Nintendo watchers are also optimistic about the company's ability make more money by developing smartphone versions of its treasure trove of classic game titles. ""Switch is the big driver for now and the next 3-5 years,"" video game analysts Jeffries wrote in a recent note. But after that, Nintendo's mobile games business ""will become a force to reckon with."" ""Super Mario Run,"" the company's first foray into mobile games, broke an Apple (AAPL, Tech30) record for app downloads in its first few days. But many users complained about the high price they had to pay to unlock all of the game's levels. But Nintendo appears to have learned from that experience as it prepares to roll out a mobile version of another popular game, ""Animal Crossing."" Thanks to brisk Switch sales and the expectation of more mobile game offerings, gains in Nintendo shares have reached a whopping 75% so far this year. Its shares ended down 0.3% in Tokyo on Monday ahead of the company's earnings report."
"The company's newest high-end laptop, available October 31, is the idealized version of a Chromebook. It is well designed, secure, fast and flexible. Starting at $999, it's the finest hardware you're likely to find running Google's PC operating system, Chrome OS. Despite the price and gloss, the Pixelbook feels like more of an advertisement for the Chrome OS than a real competitor to high-end laptops like Apple's MacBook Pro or Microsoft's Surface. Launched six years ago, Chrome OS is designed to be cloud first. It's basically a web browser stretched into an operation system. It runs web apps and recently added support for Android apps. You don't get all the features found in full versions of software like Photoshop, but the assumption is that most people don't need all the bells and whistles. Chromebooks are for the bread and butter of daily computing, from making spreadsheets and organizing photos to watching videos. Almost all major computer manufacturers make their own Chromebooks, including Acer, Dell (DVMT), Toshiba (TOSBF), Asus, HP and Samsung (SSNLF). They're available in various shapes and sizes, as laptops and desktops. Most cost less than $500. There's even the Chromebit, an $85 dongle that turns any screen into a computer. Their top selling points are security, simplicity and affordability. Related: Why Google, Apple and Microsoft are battling for education  Which is why the Pixelbook book doesn't quite fit. The beauty of Chrome OS is that it doesn't need expensive hardware. If you're going to drop a grand on a laptop, you'll likely want it to run the full versions of specific applications. Still, it's a beautiful computer. The Pixelbook is a convertible laptop with a 12.3-inch LCD touchscreen display. It can bend all the way back and be used as a somewhat bulky tablet, or you can prop it up in a tent position to watch videos. It has a pair of USB Type C ports and a headphone jack. It starts with 8GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. There's an optional stylus, the $99 Pixelbook Pen, that is sold separately. The device is aluminum with some glossy white color-blocking, similar to the design found on Pixel phones. The keyboard feels great, and the low keys offer satisfying clacks. Google Assistant, a feature that has been incorporated throughout the device, can be triggered via a dedicated button or voice command. Google is pushing the assistant across all of its devices, but it doesn't feel nearly as necessary on a PC as with a smartphone or smart speaker. What the Pixelbook does best is show off how far the Chrome OS has come, and what it looks like at its finest. After decades of the same options, Chrome OS has emerged as a surprise contender for future of PC computing. It helps that Google (GOOGL, Tech30) has managed to stealthily lure people into its ecosystem over the years. The company has made its services and apps available for free on competing PC and mobile operating systems. YouTube, Maps, Gmail and Google Docs are regularly the top most downloaded apps for Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) iOS. The switch from a Windows or Mac PC to a Chromebook would be painless for most people. But the switch to a Pixelbook might hurt their wallet."
"Google (GOOG) announced on Monday its Photos service can now recognize pets. Users will be able to see pictures of animals grouped alongside people, and your pet can be labeled and searched for by name. This means you no longer have to type ""dog"" or ""cat"" into Google Photos' search function. The update rolls out in most countries starting on Monday. Related: Google Photos gets smarter about sharing, can make books While the app can distinguish a Golden Retriever from a Jack Russell Terrier, it seems to have more difficulty telling apart animals of the same color or breed. For example, when tested by CNN Tech, the app thought five distinct Westies were all the same dog. It also grouped different gray shih tzus together and included a photo of a gray bunny in that cluster, too. However, the app nailed photos of an orange tabby cat (who's named Pablo, by the way).  ""If you have a number of pets that are the same breed and look quite similar -- such as a few yellow labs -- you might need to help Google Photos by removing photos of a mis-grouped pet, so the app can tell Lassie from Fido,"" a Google spokeswoman told CNN Tech. The free photo-sharing service, which launched in 2015, automatically organizes your photo library, such as grouping pictures by place or person. It has unlimited storage for compressed photos and a paid option for full-sized images. Earlier this year, Google Photos unveiled several new features, like the ability to print photo books and to automatically share some or all of your pictures with a significant other or friend. CNN Tech's Heather Kelly contributed to this report."
"A new security flaw, discovered by researcher Mathy Vanhoef of the University of Leuven in Belgium, appears to be affecting Wi-Fi connections. The issue stems from WPA2, a protocol that secures wireless networks. The flaw, called KRACK (short for Key Reinstallation Attack), could let a hacker within range of your device break encryption and potentially steal and manipulate data. ""Attackers can use this novel attack technique to read information that was previously assumed to be safely encrypted,"" Vanhoef wrote. ""This can be abused to steal sensitive information such as credit card numbers, passwords, chat messages, emails, photos, and so on."" This means an attacker could trick someone's device into connecting to their Wi-Fi access point, instead of the one to which they're trying to connect. But there's bit of a silver lining: There are no reports of this flaw being exploited in the wild, and some companies have already issued patches. In his report, Vanhoef listed a number of operating systems at risk, including Google Android, Linux, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) MacOS, Microsoft Windows, OpenBSD, MediaTek, and Linksys. Related: The U.S. government is making federal communications more secure Android 6.0 and Linux are the most at risk, the report said. ""We're aware of the issue, and we will be patching any affected devices in the coming weeks,"" a Google spokesperson told CNN Tech. Meanwhile, Microsoft said customers who have the latest Windows Update, launched last week, and applied the security updates, are automatically protected. Apple confirmed the flaw has been patched on all its products and a fix will be available for everyone in the next few weeks. If you use only secure websites -- that is, those that use HTTPS, instead of HTTP with a lock icon in the address bar -- you're protected from this vulnerability, according to the report. However, that can be difficult on mobile apps. United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) issued a warning on Monday that encouraged all Wi-Fi users to install updates when available. The organization is keeping a running list of affected vendors. The Wi-Fi Alliance, a group of companies that defines Wi-Fi standards and certifies products, said it will now test for the vulnerability as part of its certification process and provide a detection tool to any of its members. An attack may also be a challenge for hackers execute. ""The good news is that for most home users, the attacks are computationally expensive and not trivial,"" said Kenneth White, a Washington D.C.-based security consultant to federal agencies. ""But Android owners in particular should be checking for updates and pressing their device maker for a response."" Vanhoef said that home users should make it a priority to update phones and computers."
"A new online reporting portal from the country's eSafety Commissioner's office aims to assist people who have suffered from the spread of intimate, nude or sexual images distributed without consent. Revenge porn has affected one in five Australians between the ages of 16 to 49, according to a recent study from researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne. By contrast, one out of 25 Americans have been victims of similar abuse, a report from the New York-based Data & Society Research Institute suggests. In Australia, similar to in the United States, only certain states and territories have laws to protect citizens against the non-consensual sharing of photos and videos. This new portal intends to support and guide individuals through options such as reporting images to the police, flagging social media sites, or informing the eSafety Commissioner's office. Individuals can put in a request to connect with a lawyer to discuss cases, get an explanation of local laws, and get help for applying for a protection order. Those who use the service can also find counselors and other support resources. Related: Facebook's imperfect fight against revenge porn ""It is the most comprehensive resource on this issue that I have seen,"" Dr. Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami School of Law and Cyber Civil Rights Initiative's legislative and tech policy director, told CNN Tech.

Australia also has an established portal to help victims of cyberbullying. Related: The 20-year-old leading the March Against Revenge Porn The vast majority of image-based abuse affects private citizens, but the issue has made headlines in recent years as celebrities have become victims, too.

In March, news surfaced that an ex-boyfriend of actress Mischa Barton was shopping around sexually explicit photos of her. In June, Barton won her case. The court ordered her ex hand over any explicit videos and images."
"""We're roughly in the 30% range right now,"" Armstrong says in a new episode of CNN's Boss Files with Poppy Harlow. ""I think to get there it requires us to promote from internally, hire from the outside obviously, and then in some cases, for us to create new positions in areas where we're going to go into the new business we're going to have new areas that women can lead."" Oath, the newly merged company formed out of the merger of AOL and Yahoo, is owned by Verizon (VZ, Tech30) and manages media brands like AOL, Huffington Post, Yahoo, TechCruch, and Tumblr. Oath says they have not yet released their diversity report. ""Having more women leaders is actually an enhancement for the entire corporation,"" Armstrong says. ""I think every piece of data you see says having a more diverse workforce and having more women involved in it actually leads to better outcomes, better growth,"" he says. According to a report from consulting firm McKinsey, companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15% more likely to outperform financially in their industry. Armstrong says changes to the ""behavior of the company, or the behavior of individuals"" are key to gender parity in the workplace. Related: Women do ask for pay raises, they just don't get them One example: asking for raises. ""If you have a woman and a man come into a business and over the next five years the man is more aggressive asking for a raise each year, and the women are less aggressive, over time... you start with an immediate gap,"" he says. A recent study by Cass Business School, the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom and the University of Wisconsin, found that men are 25% more likely to get a raise when they ask for one. Armstrong's commitment to elevating women in the workplace came from ""five or six years of understanding the space,"" he says. In 2012, as AOL's CEO, Armstrong launched Makers, a digital platform with original videos and interviews of trailblazing women, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Oprah Winfrey. Armstrong says AOL has put its ""largest investment"" into this brand. The idea was sparked after his daughter met former Xerox CEO Ursula Burns while the family was on vacation. Armstrong recalls his daughter putting Burns' signed autograph over her desk in her bedroom. ""It struck me that I had just walked ten steps down the hall, but my son -- who I love -- may actually end up earning more and having a better opportunity only because he was male, and my two daughters, ten feet down the hall may have not had the same opportunity,"" he says. Related: Former Xerox CEO Ursula Burns: It's a 'time of power' for women in tech Armstrong's initial plan was to launch a separate company in which ""all leadership, all people who work for the company [would be] women."" But after a conversation with actress Marlo Thomas and writer and feminist organizer Gloria Steinem, he changed course. ""Gloria Steinem said, 'Tim that's the opposite of what we need. We need somebody like you in your position to essentially take more risk inside of your own ecosystem. And by the way, companies perform better when there's men and women so don't think about women-only, think about how to combine that,'"" Armstrong recalls. Armstrong's mission comes at a time when the tech sector is grappling with rampant sexual harassment. When asked about the controversial memo by Google engineer James Damore that argued that women are less biologically fit than men for leadership roles in tech, Armstrong says, ""I don't believe it. I don't see it."" ""If you take the time to understand what someone's superpower is, it doesn't matter if they're male or female. And we have great examples of super power women engineers and product people at our company,"" he says. Armstrong says he realizes his goal of parity of men and women in leadership at Oath by 2020 is going to be difficult to reach. But, he notes, ""I honestly think this: We're not the biggest company in the world, we're not the most profitable, but one thing we do have is, we have an investment in the space already. So if there's one company in the world that should try to lead this, it should be us,"" Armstrong tells Harlow."

"This week, the embattled ride-hailing company was sued by three Latina engineers who allege that they, as women and people of color, were paid less than their white or Asian male colleagues. Two of the women -- Ingrid Avenda?o and Roxana del Toro Lopez -- left Uber this summer, while Ana Medina is still employed by the company. They allege that Uber uses a ""stack ranking"" system for evaluating employees, meaning they're evaluated from ""worst to best."" Related: What happens if Uber loses London for good? ""In this system,"" the suit says, ""female employees and employees of color are systematically undervalued....because [they] receive, on average, lower rankings despite equal or better performance."" And those stack rankings are then used, in part, to determine promotions. Additionally, Uber sets employee pay based on their past compensation, which inherently disadvantages women, they say. As a result, the women ""have suffered and will continue to suffer harm, including but not limited to lost earnings, lost benefits, and other financial loss, as well as non-economic damanges."" The suit, which was filed this week in San Francisco County, claims that Uber is in violation of the Equal Pay Act. The women are suing on behalf of all similarly impacted employees under a state law called the Private Attorneys General Act.

"Sidewalk Labs, an urban innovation company owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, is teaming with Toronto to begin planning a neighborhood designed as a model for urban life in the 21st century. Sidewalk Labs will invest $50 million in an initial phase of planning and pilot testing. Alphabet has also pledged to relocate Google's headquarters in Canada to the new neighborhood, called Quayside, which is on the Toronto waterfront. Google has roughly 1,000 employees in Canada. Sidewalk Labs plans to do everything from reduce pollution, commute times and landfill waste to improve the weather. It envisions reducing the impact of wind, increasing shade on sunny days and blocking rain due to smart building design and tree planting. In an ambitious proposal, Sidewalk Labs promised to make the weather more comfortable to enjoy the waterfront. It also believes it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 73%, potable water consumption by 65% and landfill waste generation by 90%. Transportation would be prioritized around walking, cycling and shared electric vehicles. There would be more flexibility in zoning to allow for a blend of land use for residential, commercial and other uses. Related: 10 cities living in the future ""This is not some random activity from our perspective,"" Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said at a news conference Tuesday.

There will be high-speed communication networks, as well as long-range, low-bandwidth connectivity. The latter is critical for placing sensors in public spaces and buildings to report environmental data such as carbon monoxide, noise, vibration and temperature. Leaders from Google and the Canadian government said Tuesday that they hope the model will scale to additional land ripe for redevelopment along Toronto's waterfront, and all over the world."
"Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), the parent company of Google, said Thursday that its sales hit $27.77 billion for the third quarter, a gain of 24% from the same period a year earlier. The sales growth, among its best in recent quarters, was driven in part by Google's continued traction serving ads on mobile devices and YouTube. In a statement, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat also credited the ""strength"" of Other Bets, which refers to the company's various moonshot projects. The category, which includes Nest and high-speed Internet access, saw sales jump to $302 million in the quarter from less than $200 million a year earlier. Losses for these costly bets narrowed slightly as well, but remained high at $812 million for the quarter.

"Richard Branson announced Thursday that he is investing in Hyperloop One, a startup developing a futuristic high-speed transportation system first dreamed up by Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Branson and his company, Virgin Group, are investing an undisclosed sum in the startup to kick off a new global partnership. As part of deal, the startup will rebrand as Virgin Hyperloop One and Branson will join the board. ""After visiting Hyperloop One's test site in Nevada and meeting its leadership team this past summer, I am convinced this groundbreaking technology will change transportation as we know it and dramatically cut journey times,"" Branson said in a statement. Virgin's plan is to focus on using Hyperloop One to transport passengers and cargo. In 2013, Musk pitched an idea for entrepreneurs to create a massive vacuum tube that could one day transport someone from Los Angeles to New York in 45 minutes. He described the hyperloop concept as ""a cross between a Concorde, a railgun and an air hockey table."" Related: Hyperloop: Transportation nirvana, or a pipedream? Multiple startups took up the challenge, including Hyperloop One, cofounded by Musk's friend Shervin Pishevar. The startup had raised more than $200 million prior to Tuesday's announcement. Earlier this year, the company completed its first test track outside Las Vegas. ""You may first have heard of the original hyperloop name through Elon Musk,"" Branson wrote in a blog post announcing the deal. ""Hyperloop technology has been explicitly open-sourced and others have been encouraged to take the ideas and further develop them."" ""Virgin Hyperloop One are leading the way in these efforts,"" he continued, noting that the company is ""working on exciting projects in the Middle East, Europe, India, Canada, and the US."" But Hyperloop One has not been without controversy. The company was embroiled in a messy lawsuit last year between its two founders. The lawsuit claimed Hyperloop One, Pishevar and other leaders mismanaged the company's money, hired family members, and threatened cofounder Brogan BamBrogan. Meanwhile, Musk is now working part-time on a similar project, called The Boring Company. It is building a network for underground tunnels to enable much faster transport between cities. In July, Musk dropped the H-word in a tweet about the project: ""Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins."""

"Now, they want to make sure election infrastructure is better protected. The DEFCON hacker conference in July hosted a Voting Machine Hacking Village, where hackers were encouraged to tinker with election equipment purchased off eBay. The room featured more than 25 pieces of equipment, such as voting machines and electronic poll books. By the end of the conference, each piece of equipment had been successfully breached. Researchers associated with event presented their findings at an Atlantic Council event on Tuesday. They announced that hackers in its community will form a coalition comprised of cyber and national security leaders, academic institutions, and government associations to focus on ways to make elections more secure on the federal, state and local level. The Center for Internet Security, National Governors Association, National Conference of State Legislatures, and the Atlantic Council are among the groups involved with the new coalition. It plans to release information for election security best practices in the next two months. The Department of Homeland Security has said 21 states' election-related systems were targeted by Russian hacking in the 2016 election, but clarified no vote tallies were altered or deleted. Jeff Moss, founder of DEFCON, said on Tuesday that the ability to hack voting machines is not new, but the attention around the issue is growing. ""Now, it's not a conversation between us and state and local officials,"" Moss said at the event. ""This has to be a discussion at a higher, more national security level."" As a part of the village, researchers at DEFCON hacked a decommissioned voting machine within minutes. They were able took control of the machine remotely. States stopped using the old machine, an AVS WinVote model, by 2014 -- but the vulnerability the hacker used to get inside the machine was made public in 2003. Related: We watched hackers break into voting machines Further, hackers discovered that an electronic poll book was improperly decommissioned and contained personal data dating back to 2008 for more than 650,000 voters from Shelby County, Tennessee. Hackers also found foreign-manufactured parts in the voting machines. Researchers said this presents a ""serious possibility"" of supply chain vulnerabilities, meaning a malicious actor could compromise parts before the machine comes off the production line. However, most technologies contain foreign-made parts. ""The bottom line is: No matter the level of nation-state hacking or interference in 2016, if our enemy's goal is to shake public confidence about the security of the vote, they may already be winning,"" researchers wrote in the findings. Researchers hope the voting village becomes a regular occurrence at DEFCON, joining other hacking villages like those focused on cars and healthcare. By sharing expertise, hackers, vendors and election officials can work together to prevent cybersecurity breaches. Many people and organizations are working to prevent future election hacking. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden recently sent letters to six top voting machine manufacturers to find out their protocols for preventing hackers from breaking into their systems. The new coalition joins other efforts to prevent cyberattacks on elections. Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government launched Defending Digital Democracy in July, and Facebook is one of the initiative's main sponsors."
"Facebook (FB, Tech30) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Wednesday the new headset, called the Oculus Go, during its VR developer conference in San Jose. The goal, according to Zuckerberg, is to get one billion people to use virtual reality. But to do so, the company has work on affordability and quality. Oculus Go is Facebook's effort to get closer to that goal. It will cost $199 and ship early next year. There are two types of headsets available on the market: those like Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream View, which require a smartphone to operate, or rigs like Oculus Rift that work with expensive PCs. Oculus Go, which doesn't require you to be tethered to a computer or pop in a smartphone, wants to fit somewhere in between with its all-in-one headset. Facebook hopes that by eliminating the need for a costly PC, the Go can bring VR to a wider audience. To make headsets more compelling, it'll have a more breathable mesh fabric, improved lenses and display. It will ship with integrated audio so you don't have to use headphones with the device. Related: Google admits its new smart speaker was eavesdropping on users The company said will bring some Samsung Gear VR experiences like games and apps to Oculus Go. Despite hype, consumer demand for VR and Oculus products appears to be lackluster. Facebook slashed prices twice on its Rift VR headset bundled with Touch controllers this year, but the second price cut was temporary. Facebook cut prices again on Wednesday by offering a bundle for $399. On stage at the Oculus Connect event, Zuckerberg acknowledged that VR isn't mainstream yet, but said he believes it will one day make the world better by helping with job creation and empathy. ""If you can't think of any way that your reality can be better, then you're not thinking hard enough,"" Zuckerberg said. But this week, Zuckerberg was criticized for his attempt at showing how VR could generate empathy. The executive announced a humanitarian effort for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico from Spaces, a social VR app, while a 360 video of the flooded island played in the background. The stunt was widely panned and many considered it insensitive. He has since apologized. Analysts believe it could still take a few years before VR hits the mainstream. ""We're not going to see a significant growth spurt until 2019 or 2020,"" said Stephanie Llamas vice president of research and strategy at market intelligence firm SuperData. ""This has to do with the technology's accessibility and ease-of-use. Without a killer app -- which we still haven't seen -- this significant growth can't happen, regardless of the tech."" Facebook acquired Oculus, then a small hardware startup, for $2 billion in 2014. In February, Facebook was ordered to pay $500 million in a lawsuit over VR technology. A jury determined Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus, violated his non-disclosure agreement. Luckey left the company in March."
"Amazon is releasing an updated version of its Kindle Oasis e-reader, now waterproofed for all your bathtub, ocean and rain storm reading needs. This is the first waterproof Kindle. The e-ink device was first released 10 years ago. The Kindle Oasis is Amazon's high-end e-reader and it has the price tag to prove it. This new version of the device starts at $250, more than double the cost of the company's popular Kindle Paperwhite. The Oasis has a 7-inch 300-dpi screen (one inch larger than the previous version) and includes a free Audible account. The device has a waterproof rating of IPX8, which means it's been tested for up to 60 minutes under two meters of fresh water. Readers have been requesting a waterproof Kindle for years. In 2009, The New York Times asked Amazon CEO Bezos about the difficulty of reading a Kindle in the bath. ""I put my Kindle in my one-gallon Ziploc bag, and it works beautifully,"" Bezos said. For avid readers who wanted more protection, third-party companies have long made waterproof cases for the devices. There are a number of other changes in the Oasis. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has doubled the starting memory amount to 8GB. There's a new option to invert the display so it shows white text on a dark background and built-in sensors adjust the brightness based on your location. Amazon is also adding new bold and font options, including the OpenDyslexic typeface. One of the signature features of the Oasis is gone: Amazon has dropped the cover that doubled as a back-up battery. The new Oasis battery lasts ""weeks,"" according to Amazon. The device still has its signature asymmetrical design. Kindle Oasis will be available on October 31. In addition to the 8GB model, there's a 32GB version ($280) and a 32GB version with a cellular connection ($350). If the Oasis seems too expensive for a simple e-reader, don't fret. You can still get a bare-bones Kindle for $80 and a box of Ziploc freezer bags for $5 on Amazon."

"As sporting events increasingly go digital -- from the stadium systems to scorekeeping -- experts warn those systems can be hacked. The Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity released new research on Tuesday that says hackers could disrupt everything from ticketing to announcement systems in an effort to cause chaos or win medals at massive sporting events. The study focused on the Olympic Games over the next 10 to 15 years. The research is backed in part by the Los Angeles Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games 2028. The California city is hosting the summer Olympics in just over a decade. Current cybersecurity efforts are still largely focused on areas like protecting websites or email accounts. Betsy Cooper, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity and the paper's lead author, said people should consider a broader range of threats. ""The worst thing that most people think about happening is 'What if the website goes down?'"" she said. ""But just as we've seen in the 2016 election, you have to be really creative in thinking about the types of implications that someone [may] impose on a major sporting event."" The report lists eight key areas of risk for Olympic meddling, including hacks on photo or video replays, athlete care, transportation, and panic-inducing actions. In the not-too-distant future, the report says, the world might see a headline like this one: ""Austrian Swimmer Allegedly Hired Hacker to Gain Access to Competitors' Email."" The Olympics is ostensibly a neutral platform but is often politicized or manipulated. During the Cold War, attention focused largely on the the U.S. and Russia competition. In 1972, a group of Palestinian terrorists kidnapped and eventually killed 11 Israeli Olympic team members at the Munich Olympics. In 2016, the former head of Russia's anti-doping laboratory exposed a state-run drug program designed to make Russian athletes win at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Related: A smart fish tank left a casino vulnerable to hackers Sports is already a focus of hackers. Last year, Russian hackers leaked medical data related to 25 Olympic athletes. Organizations and websites affiliated with the Rio Olympics experienced distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the summer of 2016. Hackers targeted the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The hacker group Anonymous launched a DDoS attack on the Formula 1 website in 2012. Machines monitor a lot of sporting activity, and in one sport, computerized decision making is the norm. A system called Hawk-Eye is used in major sports like tennis and lets players challenge whether the ball was in or out. The digital technology's decision overrules the human umpire. ""If somebody could get into the Hawk-Eye system and manipulate the way it makes decisions, it could actually affect the outcome of the sport,"" Cooper said. ""As we include more digital technologies into sports and use them to detect false starts and to measure the amplitude of a jump, we also incorporate new vectors of possible risk."" Cooper says attackers could also use hacks to cause physical harm. For example, a terrorist hacker could put messages on a scoreboard that cause people to panic and rush out of the stadium. Cooper hopes the research helps people better understand the potential risks of adding digital technologies to sports without weighing the consequences. ""In events like sports, like elections, like all sorts of systems in our world, we need to start thinking about cybersecurity as something everyone has a role to play in, not just the IT manager,"" she said."

"Security analyst Randy Abrams first discovered the malicious pop-up message when he visited the Equifax website to confirm personal data, he told CNN Tech. What he found instead was yet another security issue for the credit agency. A malicious pop-up asked Abrams to download something claiming to be Adobe Flash. But as Ars Technica initially reported, security companies consider the file adware. Equifax says its systems were not compromised and the issue did not affect the consumer online dispute portal. ""The issue involves a third-party vendor that Equifax uses to collect website performance data, and that vendor's code running on an Equifax website was serving malicious content,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""Since we learned of the issue, the vendor's code was removed from the webpage and we have taken the webpage offline to conduct further analysis."" It's the latest security issue for the credit agency after hackers stole data on more than 145 million people through an unpatched hole in the company's software. Equifax announced the massive security breach last month. Federal and state agencies are now probing the hack.

""We are working diligently to better serve you, and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We appreciate your patience during this time and ask that you check back with us soon."" Abrams said he was able to duplicate the pop-up four or five times. Experts initially suggested the security issue may be a result of a third-party analytics or advertising company used by Equifax displaying the adware. Many websites use analytics companies to track people who visit their sites. Consumers should never click on pop-ups that unexpectedly ask you to download software. This type of adware could hijack your browser, serve up fraudulent search results, and lead to more pop-up ads."

It is also launching a new program called ""Grow with Google"" aimed specifically at giving people in the U.S. access to free job training. As part of the initiative, Google is making its largest single donation to date: $10 million to Goodwill for digital skills trainings in the U.S. ""We recognize that there are large gaps in opportunity across the U.S.,"" said Sundar Pichai on Thursday at an event in Pittsburgh announcing the initiative. ""These are tough gaps. For instance, the nature of work is fundamentally changing. And that is shifting the link between education, training and opportunity."" Technology companies play a big role in the changing job landscape. According to CB Insights, at least 10 million jobs in the U.S. could be taken over by automation over the next decade. Meanwhile, World Economic Forum estimates about one third of jobs will require skills that aren't currently mainstream by 2020. Pichar cited an Economist survey that says fewer than half of students ages 18 to 25 believe their education will not give them the right skills for the current workforce.

"The first time I did that, my arm muscles tensed, ready to grab the steering wheel. The second time that happened, I worried a lot less. The third time, it didn't even occur to me to worry.

Similar systems, including Tesla's AutoPilot and Mercedes-Benz's Drive Pilot, automatically maintain a safe distance behind cars ahead on the highway and can keep your car safely in its lane, just like the Cadillac. But they require your hands on the steering wheel most of the time. Cadillac's SuperCruise requires your attention but not your hands. I could take my hands off the wheel but I could not take my eyes off the road. A tiny camera on the steering column watched my face. If I turned away from the road for too long a bar of light in the steering wheel rim began flashing then, after a bit, changed color from green to red. Finally, after about 10 seconds, a tone would sound and Super Cruise would refuse to keep working. This is Cadillac parent General Motors' (GM) answer to the toughest challenge of automated cars, their human drivers. Until self-driving cars are perfect, which won't be for some time, human beings will have to remain mentally engaged in driving even when they're not actually doing it. We'll need to be ready to take control Case in point: That now-infamous Tesla crash in Florida. The Tesla's camera system didn't register a truck turning left into its path. The driver, who had repeatedly ignored warnings to hold the steering wheel, evidently didn't either. There was no attempt to even slow down as the car drove under the truck, killing the driver. That's very unlikely with Super Cruise. For one thing, the driver would have been forced to watch the road. For another, GM's system only works on specific intersection-free highways where crossing traffic doesn't occur. These highways, which include most major U.S. arteries, have been mapped in great detail. The location of every curve, hill and toll booth is locked in. If you're approaching a toll booth, or if the lane you're in is about to end -- the car relies on super-accurate GPS that can tell which lane you're in -- you are alerted that you must take the wheel. If you want to change lanes, that's on you. Super Cruise will take over again when you're done. A Tesla or Mercedes could change lanes for you when you activate the turn signal. The difference seems to be less about any weakness in GM's technology than it is a more cautious approach to using it. GM just doesn't think the tech is good enough, yet. Super Cruise does have one serious issue. Getting it started is, ironically, really distracting. Once you're on an appropriate highway, you have to wait for a little gray steering wheel symbol to appear in the gauge cluster. While it's there, you press a button on the real steering wheel. But the symbol is only there when you're in the dead center of your lane. As you glance down to look, you're likely to drift a little to one side and... it's gone. Still, Super Cruise is further proof that the future is close at hand. But, for now, keep your eyes on the road."
"The short-term rental startup announced on Thursday plans to build a 324-unit apartment building in Kissimmee, Florida -- located near Walt Disney World Resorts. The building, which will be branded as ""Niido Powered by Airbnb,"" is slated to open in early 2018. The modern complex will be built by Miami-based developer Newgard Development Group. It will feature keyless entry and shared common spaces. Here's what makes it distinctly Airbnb: Tenants will be able to rent out their units for up to 180 nights every year. Tenants will have access to a new app that's integrated with Airbnb that will help them manage guest stays remotely, from overseeing check-ins to arranging cleaning and linen services. Those who opt to rent out their apartments on Airbnb will share revenues with their landlord, Newgard said. Newgard CEO Harvey Hernandez told CNN Tech that tenants will keep 75% of the revenue. The rest will go to the development group. Tenants will be required to sign annual leases which will be ""regular market rate,"" Hernandez said. Related: You can now book a restaurant reservation on Airbnb ""This partnership shows how landlords, developers and Airbnb can work together to create value for everyone and better serve tenants,"" said Jaja Jackson, Airbnb's director of global multifamily housing partnerships. Airbnb -- valued at $31 billion -- has run afoul with some buildings and cities in recent years. Critics of the startup argue that its services turn otherwise rentable apartments into unofficial hotels, thereby eliminating affordable housing. Last year, the startup established a ""Friendly Building Program"" to help landlords set the terms for tenants who want to rent out their places on Airbnb. That way landlords can also get a revenue split on the profits. In the announcement, Hernandez said the new model ""eliminates barriers by encouraging home sharing and creating solutions that work for everyone."" Airbnb said the building is the first of a series of developments that will support its home sharing model across the Southeastern U.S. When asked if Airbnb apartment buildings will expand beyond that region, Hernandez said ""absolutely."" Among those markets are Nashville, Tenn.; Charleston, South Carolina; and cities in Texas, he said."
"The company, which employees more than 500,000 across 220 countries, said it will begin testing self-driving delivery trucks in the second half of 2018. To get a fleet up and running, DHL said it will equip some of its existing electric delivery trucks with new self-driving equipment from tech company NVIDIA and the automotive supplier ZF. Deutsche Post DHL hasn't revealed how many vehicles will be used -- or where the tests will take place -- but said the move is expected to make its delivery service more efficient. The experiment will feature self-driving delivery trucks that follow a delivery person en route to deliver packages. The person wouldn't need to get back into the truck between dropping off packages; they'd need to remove packages from the rear of the truck. The company has not revealed how the truck will identify and accurately follow its delivery people. Perhaps one option could include a delivery person carrying a sensor in their pocket that transmits their location to the vehicle. Another potential option: training a vehicle's cameras to identify a delivery person's appearance and follow them. Deutsche Post DHL will also test whether autonomous vehicles can be used to exchange containers in parcel centers. The announcement is the latest reminder of the intense interest surrounding the autonomous vehicles industry. Intel has forecasted self-driving technology will trigger a $7 trillion market by 2050. The rapid gains in computing power is fueling the market. For example, Deutsche Post DHL partner NVIDIA now has a new and more advanced supercomputer that runs a self-driving software program for autonomous vehicles. The brand's technology is widely used among companies developing self-driving services. Amid concern that autonomous technology replacing human drivers, DHL said there will be be roles for its workforce. Related: How free self-driving car rides could change everything Many competitors are circling 2020 as a year to broadly deploy these technologies to the public.

But companies already have a head start: Uber is offering self-driving rides in Pittsburgh and Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google's parent company, has a current ride service in Phoenix. In addition to self-driving technology, DHL rival UPS has also tested drone delivery from atop some of its trucks. Meanwhile, Amazon has spent years developing a drone delivery program and completed its first delivery in Britain last year."
"Huffington, founder and CEO of Thrive Global and an Uber board member, advocated for repeating outfits while on stage at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit on Tuesday. ""Men have a competitive advantage,"" said Huffington, referring apparel choices. ""They don't have to waste the kind of energy we waste."" She said she leads by example, tagging her ensemble duplicates on Instagram with ""#repeat."" The concept has been owned by many successful men over the years. Let's recall Steve Jobs' signature black turtleneck, Mark Zuckerberg's grey T-shirt and President Barack Obama's gray or blue suits. These ""uniforms"" are a way of taking out the guesswork out of deciding what to wear. ""I'm trying to pare down decisions,"" Obama said in a 2012 Vanity Fair profile. ""I don't want to make decisions about what I'm eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make."" But the topic of appearance and fashion has always been a bit trickier for women. Related: Arianna Huffington's role helping Uber try to clean up its mess In male dominated industries like tech, some female entrepreneurs have said they've taken measures to alter their appearance to avoid unwanted sexual attention from male investors. For example, enterprise software startup Glassbreakers' CEO Eileen Carey said she became a brunette and opted to wear glasses, instead of contact lenses, for this reason. Other female entrepreneurs said they have worn more androgynous clothing like suits and black apparel when pitching investors. The Muse co-founder Kathryn Minshew said she A/B tested what she wore when pitching investors to see how her apparel made an impact. Her findings: Wearing all black served her best. Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, however, didn't hide her love for fashion. In 2013, she posed for a Vogue spread, which included a sidebar, ""What Would Marissa Mayer Wear?: A Workweek Guide to Office Dressing."" It sparked a debate over whether it demeaned Mayer's successes or simply exhibited another aspect of her. The topic of how women dress in professional settings came up this week when fashion designer Donna Karan defended her friend Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul fired from his company on Sunday over recently surfaced sexual harassment and assault allegations. ""I think we have to look at ourselves,"" Karan said in an interview with Daily Mail. ""... How do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women ... What are we asking? Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality?"" Related: Uber to add another woman to its board amid crises She has since apologized for her remarks.

"Hundreds of people lined-up outside the Sydney Apple Store, according to local media. As is customary for an Apple product launch, some people camped out the sidewalk for days and even a week before the launch. People who pre-ordered online will also start receiving their devices in the mail on Friday. Apple is trying something new this year, launching two different iPhone models six weeks apart. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus went on sale September 21, but excitement was tepid outside Apple Stores compared to previous releases. Fewer people appeared to line up in person for that device, which cost hundreds less than the iPhone X. The iPhone 8 devices are more traditional than the X. They added wireless charging, better cameras, and faster processors, but nothing as thrilling and futuristic as an animated poop emoji.

"Silicon Valley survived an intense grilling by Congress this week, but the fallout may continue. The top lawyers for Facebook (FB, Tech30), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30), and Google (GOOGL, Tech30) testified before Senate and House committees into how foreign nationals used these platforms to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. The hearings, which focused disproportionately on Facebook, provided the first official glimpses of Russian-bought social media ads and revealed this content reached a larger audience than previously reported. Facebook, for its part, repeatedly pledged during the hearing and on an investor call after to take the issue seriously and invest more heavily in preventing abuses of its platform. ""I've expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tool to sow distrust,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on an earnings call Wednesday afternoon. ""What they did is wrong and we are not going to stand for it."" Related: Why aren't the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter testifying? Yet, the line of questioning this week exposed sincere doubts some legislators have about Facebook's slow response to the problem and whether it's capable of policing an audience that now numbers in in the billions. The prospect of new regulation looms. So does the possibility of Congress requesting Zuckerberg and the CEOs of the other two companies to testify at a later date. Russian meddling impact worse than expected On the eve of the first hearing, Facebook revealed that roughly 126 million Americans may have been exposed to content generated on its platform by a Russian government-linked troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency between June 2015 and August 2017. The figure was then increased during the hearings. Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, said the reach was nearly 150 million with Instagram included in the mix. The disclosure represents a stark shift from the first days after the election, when Zuckerberg dismissed the impact of fake news on Facebook on voters. But this staggering number may still not represent the total Russian activity on the platform. It's just what Facebook has been able to track down so far. Facebook, and the other two companies, told lawmakers they continue to investigate the matter. The tech companies also could not rule out that other countries, including North Korea and Turkmenistan, could have taken advantage of their platforms too. Throwing money at the problem As the final hearing was wrapping up Wednesday, Zuckerberg kicked off Facebook's earnings call with a striking announcement: Facebook intended to invest so much in security that it would cut into profits. ""I am dead serious about this,"" he said on the call. A key part of the investment, first announced during the hearings, will be increasing the number of people who work on safety and security issues from 10,000 currently to 20,000 by the end of 2018. It's unclear how many of these will be full-time employees as opposed to contractors. Zuckerberg also said Facebook is investing more in engineering teams focused on security and artificial intelligence solutions.  While Zuckerberg framed the announcement as being part of Facebook's ""responsibility to society,"" it also may be an attempt to reduce the odds of Congress imposing tough regulation. ""We think the company's forceful response -- much more so than peers -- is a winning strategy in positioning the company more as a friend than a foe in the eyes of regulators,"" James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt, wrote in an investor note Thursday. Congress is not satisfied with tech promises Despite the tech executives pledging again and again to take the issue seriously, it was clear members of Congress -- and particularly the Democrats -- were unsatisfied. ""I've been very proud... to represent this tech community from California, but I must say I don't think you get it,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, said at a hearing Wednesday. ""What we're talking about is the beginning of cyber warfare,"" she continued, before issuing a vague threat. ""We are not going to go away, gentlemen. This is a very big deal."" Related: Seen any of these before? You may have been targeted by Russian ads on Facebook Sen. Mark Warner, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, lambasted the tech companies for not doing enough previously to address concerns about election meddling on their platforms. ""We've raised these claims since the beginning of the year, and the leaders of your companies blew us off,"" Warner said. ""Your earliest presentations showed a lack of resources, a lack of genuine effort and a lack of commitment."" Warner is the co-sponsor of a new piece of legislation called the Honest Ads Act, which would require Facebook and other online companies to provide more transparency for political ads that run on their platforms. Beyond any single piece of regulation, however, this week revealed a more fundamental disconnect between Silicon Valley and Washington over how much social media companies should interfere with content shared and promoted by users. Some in Congress believe Facebook and its peers need to do more to crackdown on misinformation and dangerous content. Stretch said in one hearing that Facebook does not want to be the ""arbiters of truth."""

Earlier today @realdonaldtrump's account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee. The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored.

Others speculated about whether Twitter barred Trump from the platform. My guess: Trump's lawyers told him to delete his account, because he is in serious legal jeopardy Perhaps one of the most defining elements of his presidency, Trump's Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) use consistently makes headlines. Trump often uses the platform to levy attacks publicly. Those on the receiving end of his tweets include Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill who he views as roadblocks to his policy initiatives. The press has often been the subject of vitriolic tweets. And NFL players who kneel during the anthem to protest racial injustice have been targets of @realDonaldTrump. Related: Trump's tweets lead to bad news coverage, study shows Perhaps most notably, however, Trump has also used Twitter to lash out at North Korea, the rogue Asian nation that claims to have a newly bolstered nuclear arsenal.

Trump tweeted in September, using his choice nickname for North Korea leader Kim Jong-un. The North Korean government claimed the tweet constituted a declaration of war. Many called for Trump to be booted from the platform, arguing his tweets -- which often seem to be typed out on a whim -- could plunge America into a nuclear war. But Twitter declined to bar Trump's account, saying it must weigh the newsworthiness of Trump's tweets with its violent rhetoric."
"Apple (AAPL, Tech30) said Thursday it expects sales for the upcoming holiday quarter of between $84 billion and $87 billion, as the $999 iPhone X finally hits the market. The projected revenue generally exceeded Wall Street's expectations, potentially easing concerns about rumored supply constraints for the new high-end smartphone. It would also set a new quarterly sales record for the company. Apple stock popped as much as 3% in after hours trading Thursday. If those gains hold when the market opens, Apple would approach a $900 billion market cap. Apple announced two new phones in September: the iPhone X and the more affordable iPhone 8. The 8 went on sale at the very end of the most recent quarter. The X goes on sale Friday. On a conference call with analysts Thursday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said pre-orders for the iPhone X have been ""very strong."" He cited early reports of lines forming outside its stores ahead of the launch. When asked about the unusually high price tag for X, Cook suggested it amounted to a few coffees a week, when broken down. ""Look at the U.S. carriers. I think you would find you could buy an iPhone X for $33 a month,"" he said. ""That's a few coffees a week. Less than a coffee a day at one of these nice coffee places."" Related: iPhone X first impressions: The highs, lows and quirks The X is the first iPhone in several years with a redesigned look. It has a giant screen, no home button and lets you unlock it by scanning your face. Cook said he was encouraged by Apple's ability so far to ramp up production of the iPhone X, given its new features. ""We're going to get as many of them as possible to the customers as soon as possible,"" he said. The release of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have been somewhat overshadowed by the upcoming IPhone X launch, with reports suggesting demand for the 8 could be weaker than expected. Cook stressed that the devices have been selling well, but admitted the staggered launch of two new iPhone models marks a new approach for the company with certain unknowns. ""We're gonna learn something,"" Cook said. Even without the iPhone X on the market, Apple's smartphone sales are growing. Apple sold 46.7 million iPhones in the three-month period ending September 30, up 3% from the same quarter a year earlier. The increase in iPhone sales, combined with an 11% increase in iPads sold and continued growth in sales from services like Apple Pay and iCloud, helped push up Apple's overall sales by double-digit percentages. Apple's sales for the quarter hit $52.6 billion, up 12% from the same quarter a year ago."
"The company, Iso Rivolta, made very handsome coupes with Corvette engines during the 1950s and '60s, an era that saw the creation of many of Italy's most famous automobiles. The concept car from the now-revived Iso Rivolta looks edgier than the brand's rather understated classics but it sticks to tradition in terms of power. It has a 997-horsepower modified Corvette V8 engine and a 10-speed transmission. Designed by the Italian auto design firm Zagato, the Iso Rivolta Vision Gran Turismo will be available to drive in the video game Gran Turismo Sport on the Sony PlayStation 4. As many as five of these cars will be produced in real life for actual customers. There is no word yet on how much each one will cost. But it will, no doubt, be far cheaper to drive one in the video game. Among more familiar automakers, Toyota (TM) revealed the Fine Comfort Ride concept. Yes. That's its actual name. The van-shaped vehicle envisions a hydrogen fuel cell-powered luxury car with an emphasis on roominess over slick styling. The car's body tapers slightly toward the rear for better aerodynamics while maximizing passenger space. Like all fuel cell vehicles, it emits only water vapor as exhaust. Nissan's IMx concept looks like a boxier version of the Nissan (NSANF) Murano crossover. It is, according to Nissan, a fully autonomous vehicle with entertainment systems controlled by hand and eye movements. It's electrically driven with separate motors for the front and back wheels. (As with most concept vehicles, it's unclear how much, if any, of this technology actually exists in the car.) With little in the way of technological pretensions, Mazda's Vision Coupe concept is purely a design exercise. It shows what Mazda's designers are working on for future Mazda cars. It's supposed to be a more refined interpretation of Japanese design esthetics, Mazda (MZDAF) says. The body has what Mazda calls a ""one motion"" shape implying speed and grace. If you live in America, the Suzuki car you probably remember best was the old Samurai SUV. It was a tiny Jeep competitor. (Suzuki dropped out of the U.S. market five years ago.) The Suzuki e-Survivor concept is, essentially, a modern electric Samurai. Each wheel is powered by its own electric motor. Honda's Sports EV concept is a follow-up to the Urban EV concept unveiled at last month's Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany. Where the Urban EV had a boxy body reminiscent of an early Civic, the Sports EV has a lower, sleeker and more aggressive look. It's designed to be fun to drive even though it does have artificial intelligence technology, Honda (HMC) says."
"The iPhone X, which hits store shelves November 3, is Apple's most expensive phone yet. But the higher price tag isn't reserved just for the phone. Repairs are more expensive, too. A broken screen will set you back $275, according to repair costs posted to the Apple web site. For comparison, a screen repair for Apple's new $799 iPhone 8 Plus, costs $169. The figures were reported earlier by MacRumors. Those repair prices come down if you splurge for AppleCare+ -- an extended warranty program that adds $199 onto the iPhone X's sticker price. Related: 10 things you need to know about iPhone X In return, AppleCare+ covers all but $29 of screen repairs and all but $99 worth of any other type of ""accidental damage."" There's a catch, however. AppleCare+ only covers two instances of accidental damage. If you accidentally damage your phone a third time, the cost of repairing hardware could run up to $549. AppleCare+ extends the basic warranty that covers non-accidental iPhone mishaps -- such as battery issues or a faulty headphone jack -- from one year to two. The iPhone X was unveiled to much fanfare last month. It boasts a radical update to the iPhone models of years past, with an all-glass display and an option to unlock with facial recognition. It also has an all-glass back, so owners run the risk of cracking either side of the phone. However, Apple has claimed the glass on the iPhone 8 and iPhone X is much stronger than earlier models, so it could be harder to break. Pre-orders for the phone began online Friday, and units were selling out quickly. The U.S. Apple Store site said it would take five to six weeks for new orders to ship. --CNNMoney's Heather Kelly contributed to this report."
"The company said Wednesday that it burned through $1.3 billion in the most recent quarter -- far more than Wall Street had been expected -- and posted the largest quarterly loss in the company's history. And its guidance suggested it could burn through another $1 billion in the current quarter as it tries to fix its production woes. That has some worried that the automaker could run into a cash crunch. Related: Tesla sued for Model 3 delays ""At the current burn rate [Tesla] would be below its $1 billion operating cash target in two quarters,"" said Colin Langan, an auto analyst with UBS. He recommends that investors sell Tesla shares. He said that Tesla will need additional cash to execute on its plans beyond the Model 3, such as releasing a new SUV and expanding its network of stores and charging stations. The mass market Model 3 is a make-or-break car for the company, which until now has sold luxury cars. The new model was supposed to be rolling off of assembly lines at a rate of 5,000 a week by the end of this year. But problems at its Gigafactory battery plant will push that target back to at least March, CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday evening. Company officials now can't say when they'll reach their goal of producing 10,000 Model 3's a week. They originally promised that level of output by sometime next year. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) plunged 7% in trading Thursday, although they are still up nearly 40% so far this year. Tesla executives insists it has the cash it needs to get production of the Model 3 up to 5,000 a week by March, and that once it does that, the cash it will get from the increased sales that will generate will give the cash it needs. And they insist they know how to fix their problems, especially in the assembly of batteries that will power the cars. Related: Tesla could face an uphill slog in China ""If you talked to me three weeks ago, I would have been quite pessimistic,"" Musk admitted to investors Wednesday.

The cash burn might not matter as much as long as the company can keep raising the cash it needs from financial markets. Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley auto analyst, wrote that he's ""somewhat concerned"" about the rate of spending cash, but confident about the willingness of capital markets to continue to fund Tesla's growth plans ""for now."" Potential customers for the Model 3 seem willing to wait as long as it takes to get the car, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis. But she said investors won't have the same unlimited patience. ""It does seems [Tesla has] an endless amount of resources since they're such a Wall Street darling,"" she said. ""But it's important for them to prove they can fix this. If they don't show better production by the first quarter of 2018, that would be a red flag for investors."" Musk insisted the growing pains are natural since Tesla is expanding so fast. ""We're talking about a rate of growth faster than the Model T, which is the fastest in history. So these are nutty growth rates,"" he told investors."
"He decided to splurge on a gray sofa from West Elm -- until he realized it wouldn't be available for 12 weeks. Since Chopra was in a short graduate school program at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, it didn't seem worth the wait. Instead, he ordered a red couch on sale from a West Elm store. To avoid paying a pricey shipping fee, Chopra carried it several blocks home. ""After paying a lot of money, this isn't the experience you want to have,"" Chopra told CNN Tech. ""Whether it's a lower or higher price point, no one was really solving the problem of convenience and thinking about the experience from end to end.""

Pieces snap together. (However, some reviewer's on Burrow's site said it took a bit longer to assemble). Its products are customizable and modular, so customers can add or subtract seats and parts based on preferences or the size of a room. ""We want to be the Warby Parker of couches,"" Chopra said. Burrow furniture is made from similar materials used by high-end retailers like Crate & Barrel, but are shipped to customers for free in flat boxes within a week of purchase. The furniture breaks down again for easy move out. Burrow furniture also has built in USB ports. ""[We] designed this around solving every single problem people face when buying and moving furniture,"" Kuhl said.  And so far, the concept is working: Burrow hit $1 million in sales in six months and is on target to reach $4 million in sales by the end of this year. It unveiled on Thursday two new products, its first ottoman ($295) and chaise sectional (up to $1,745, depending on design). Retailers like West Elm also offer modular furniture options, but at a higher price point, and with longer delivery wait times and more shipping costs. Related: Why is Ikea buying TaskRabbit?

"The company's highly anticipated new device is expected to sell well in the world's largest smartphone market. But experts say it's unlikely to reverse Apple's loss of market share to aggressive Chinese rivals. China is one of Apple's most important markets, and CEO Tim Cook pays regular visits. He and other business leaders attended an event with President Xi Jinping just this week. The U.S. tech giant has struggled there in recent years, though. The iPhone suffered six consecutive quarters of declining sales in China through the end of June, according to Canalys research. Apple's overall revenue in the region has followed the same trend, falling by double digits every quarter over the same period.

""It is unlikely to drive Apple's sales volume very high."" Instead, homegrown Chinese brands Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi will continue to chip away at the U.S. company's market share.  When it comes to high-end phones -- defined by Canalys as those that cost more than $600 -- Apple is still the clear leader in China. It commanded more than 80% of that part of the Chinese market in the third quarter of this year. But domestic players are upping their game in that area too, according to He. Huawei recently recently introduced the Mate 10 Pro, which sells for around $800 in China. It's a strong challenger to the iPhone X -- and it's roughly $500 cheaper. Related: iPhone X screen repair: That'll be $275 The other big players -- Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi -- don't have any devices that can go toe-to-toe with the latest Apple offering. Not yet, anyway. ""They've got ambitions in the high market,"" He said. ""But it takes some time."" For now, the Chinese smartphone makers are dominating the market for younger, more cost-sensitive consumers with devices that may not be as expensive as the iPhone X, but still carry price tags between $300 and $500. Oppo and Vivo are particularly popular brands among Millenials thanks in part to targeted promotions, like Chinese pop stars advertising their devices on social media platforms. Meanwhile, Xiaomi is challenging Apple's ecosystem of compatible devices, offering smartphones, fitness trackers, laptops and even rice cookers that all connect to each other. Related: iPhone X pre-orders up to a six week wait Domestic players also have one more advantage Apple just can't match: they're Chinese. Chen Huanzhen, a hotel executive, said she plans buy a Huawei device rather than an iPhone X not only because it's more affordable, but also because it's the patriotic thing to do. ""I am going to switch to a Huawei from an iPhone because I want to support local Chinese products,"" she said. -- Kinnie Li contributed to this report."
"In a blog post earlier this year, Susan Fowler detailed the sexism and harassment she endured at Uber. Now, she'll be delving into her experience at the company in a book from Viking, an imprint of Penguin Books. According to a Viking press release on Thursday, the book will have ""previously unreported details of what happened after she went public with the harassment and discrimination she faced."" A publication date has not been set. Fowler's blog post alleged misconduct at the company and a failure to correct it. She later discovered others had spoken up internally about similar treatment, but Uber did little more than issue a warning. Fowler left Uber in December. Her account was the catalyst for an independent investigation into the allegations. Ultimately, Uber fired 20 employees and CEO Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO.

"When the service debuted in the city on Wednesday, one of the driverless vehicles was involved in a collision with a delivery truck, the Las Vegas government said in a statement. During the incident in downtown Las Vegas, the bus automatically stopped to try avoid an accident after its sensors detected the truck, the city said. ""Unfortunately, the delivery truck did not stop and grazed the front fender of the shuttle,"" it said.

"The business, valued at $20 billion, is most known for leasing buildings and renting office space to tech companies and entrepreneurs. But now it's growing its footprint beyond real estate to education. WeWork has acquired New York City-based Flatiron School, a popular coding education program founded in 2012. It offers accelerated mobile and web development courses at its Manhattan location and online. Classes cost between $12,000 and $15,000. The move is a part of a greater effort from WeWork to offer more services to professionals. Last year, it expanded into the housing market with the company's dorm-like apartment complexes, called WeLive, that are now open in New York and Washington, D.C. Earlier this month, WeWork announced a ""wellness facility"" in New York City called Rise, which includes fitness classes and a spa.

"The travel site has added a new warning message for businesses where sexual assault and other significant safety incidents have been reported. It has so far put the message, which it calls a ""badge,"" on the pages for three resorts in Mexico. The badges are meant to flag all health, safety and discrimination issues, including theft, sexual assault and rape, TripAdvisor spokesman Brian Hoyt told CNNMoney. Businesses will be ""badged for a minimum period of three months, and we hope it will be a catalyst ... to change their ways,"" Hoyt said. The new policy was first reported by The New York Times. The three resorts flagged by TripAdvisor are the Grand Velas Riviera Maya, the Iberostar Paraiso Maya and the Iberostar Paraiso Lindo. They are some of the most popular resorts in the Playa del Carmen area of Mexico, with thousands of reviews on TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor said they are the first -- but unlikely the last -- properties to receive the new warning. ""There's potentially going to be more as we continue to vet properties that come up in the news,"" Hoyt said. The company did an inventory of reviews posted in the last year and found ""thousand of issues come up about health and safety and discrimination,"" he said. Grand Velas Riviera Maya and Iberostar did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of business hours. Related: Uber pledges $5 million to sexual assault prevention The new approach to warning guests about safety concerns comes after The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported last week that TripAdvisor had removed forum posts and reviews warning about rape and injuries at several resorts in Mexico. Following the report, TripAdvisor apologized to Kristie Love, a 35-year-old mother from Dallas. The Journal Sentinel reported the company had repeatedly removed a post by Love from 2010 in which she said she had been raped by a security guard at Iberostar Paraiso Maya. TripAdvisor has since republished her forum post. The company maintains that it does not take down reviews or forum posts because they mention sexual assault or rape. In 2010, however, forum posts were subjected to a family friendly policy, meant to prohibit sexually explicit language, curse words and the posting of nude photos, according to Hoyt. He said the level of moderation was a ""bit of an overreach in 2010."" The policy was changed a few years later to enable consumers to post about issues including sexual assault and rape, he said. Related: How companies can stop sexual harassment before it starts TripAdvisor's new badge appears as a warning in a red box at the top of the page that users see after they click to view a resort's details. It says: ""TripAdvisor has been made aware of recent media reports or events concerning this property which may not be reflected in reviews found on this listing. Accordingly, you may wish to perform additional research for information about this property when making your travel plans."" The message does not explicitly say a business is being flagged for sexual assault or safety incidents. That language may change in the future, but for now the badge is meant to be a warning sign to customers to encourage them to do additional research, Hoyt said. A TripAdvisor committee will be reviewing badges to determine if they need to be kept attached to a business beyond the initial three months. Related: Facebook's imperfect fight against revenge porn TripAdvisor is also rolling out a new policy on communicating with users about why reviews or forum posts are rejected. Reviews are supposed to contain first-hand accounts only, so including a medical diagnosis or relaying a story from another person would lead to the post being taken down and a user receiving a generic rejection notice citing hearsay. Now, users will be told exactly which part of their review violates guidelines. ""Often it's a sentence that can be edited out and that review can be posted,"" Hoyt said. ""We've personally reached out to a lot of folks brought up in the press lately. Several of them have chosen to rewrite their reviews and edit out that second-hand information."" Forum posts are regulated differently from reviews in that they do allow hearsay."
"Four months ago, a flood of women in tech shared their stories, from an investor exposing himself during a meeting to another kissing an entrepreneur without her consent. Companies promised investigations. Some investors resigned. People suggested ways to crack down, like more specifics on what qualifies as inappropriate behavior. But months later, there have been few tangible changes made by those in power, women say. The issue is far from resolved. For example, just this week, VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson confirmed to CNN Tech it is conducting an ongoing independent investigation into ""allegations"" around a founding partner which surfaced last summer. Despite the outrage, entrepreneur Denise Brosseau said the tech industry hasn't done much to make changes that would systemically support women in an industry dominated by men. There's ""too much power, too much money, and too few reasons to change,"" said Brosseau, co-founder of women's network Springboard and CEO of consulting firm Thought Leadership Lab. Similar to the dynamic between Weinstein and the Hollywood actresses who have accused him of harassment, there's often no formal employer-to-employee relationship in tech. But there's a huge power imbalance. What does it take? According to a study conducted by Baloonr, an app for gathering anonymous feedback, about 35% of respondents said the best way to addressing tech's issue is to put more women in leadership roles. The study was conducted among 90 female venture capitalists and founders who've raised funding for their startups. The study found only 17% of participants believe a ""code of conduct"" could facilitate necessary change. Related: Ellen Pao: 'I turned down millions to tell my story' Baloonr is typically used by companies to poll their workers. But founder Amanda Greenberg launched a broader survey following the sexual harrassment allegations. More female venture capitalists Some women who've shared their harassment experiences said they aren't convinced that those in power -- investing partners and limited partners who control the funds -- are ready to make any real changes. ""Everyone is super supportive until they have to put their money where their mouth is,"" said Lisa Wang, cofounder of SheWorx, who spoke as part of CNNTech's Money, Power, Sexual Harassment special. Susan Ho, cofounder of Journy and one of the six women who spoke out against Caldbeck in June, said investors have since asked how they can help. Adding more female investing partners or investing in more female founders are efforts that could help but that many firms are shy about making formal commitments to do so, she said. ""I don't think we're going to see meaningful change unless people really realize they are leaving money on the table,"" Ho added. Policies The venture capital industry has long policed itself, but some hope that will change. The National Venture Capital Association, a tech trade organization, has committed to working on policy templates and trainings. In September, the association announced an initiative called Venture Forward that's devoted to addressing tech's sexual harassment and diversity and inclusion problem. NVCA president Bobby Franklin emphasized that the venture capital industry doesn't have highly regulated rules, unlike lawyers who can be disbarred for misconduct. ""Can you keep someone from being a VC? No,"" Franklin said. ""That's why we're trying to be deliberate."" ""What we'd like to do is help facilitate programs around sexual harassment training that we hope our members take advantage of and use these tools to educate their own firms about sexual harassment on a regular basis,"" said Maha Ibrahim, a general partner at venture capital firm Canaan Partners, who is on NVCA's board and is actively involved with Venture Forward. In August, NVCA held a three-hour sexual harassment workshop in San Francisco with roughly 60 attendees, including Brosseau and entrepreneur Cheryl Yeoh, who helped put the Malaysian startup ecosystem on the map. Yeoh spoke out against investor Dave McClure, who resigned from the firm he cofounded, 500 Startups, in the wake of harassment reports. McClure issued a broad apology for his behavior. Soon after, NVCA published its framework for moving forward. It included developing industry standard HR policies and best practices for startups. Related: Readers react to 'Money, Power and Sexual Harassment' Other ideas that surfaced during the workshop included an industry-wide third-party reporting tool, like Callisto, that could be a resource for reporting harassment. Callisto is already used on some college campuses to track harassment complaints and flag assailants who are repeat offenders. Another suggestion was to create a fund to help women in tech who are victims of harassment and want to pursue legal cases. (Ellen Pao, who sued Kleiner Perkins for sex discrimination, racked up $2.7 million in legal fees -- not something the average woman in tech can afford.) ""While NVCA deserves praise for catalyzing a healthy discussion ... it maintains they're not in a position to spearhead [a] reporting tool or play an industry ombudsman role,"" said Yeoh, adding that some attendees formed a subcommittee after attending the workshop. But those who control the money are the ones who have the power to hold venture firms' feet to the fire, the women said. And most haven't yet, at least not publicly. ""Every firm should publicly commit to publishing their own internal policies and reporting mechanism,"" said Yeoh. ""Most firms still don't have it and have not taken any steps towards it yet. There's no good reason why that should be the case."" Brosseau agrees: ""Until this is an economic imperative, nothing will change."""
"Or you can spend around $3,000 on eBay to buy a phone off of someone lucky enough have secured an early pre-order before they sold out. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) opened up pre-sales for the $999 smartphone at 12 a.m. Pacific Time on Friday. There were a few complaints of technical issues on Twitter, like a screen saying Apple could not reach the ""carrier systems"" but that a phone was reserved. Apparently it was nothing serious enough to stop people from snatching up all the phones available on November 3 in a matter of minutes. That first round of smartphones appeared to sell out in 15 minutes in our tests. On the U.S. Apple Store site, wait times for the phone were already at two to three weeks by 12:15 a.m. Phones that work on Sprint were the last to go. As of Friday afternoon, the wait time was up to five to six weeks. Related: 10 things you need to know about iPhone X It's unclear if the longer wait times are due to unusually high demand for the new phone or a supply shortage.

He cites supply chain issues with the phone, including the camera's infrared dot projector, part of its new face-detecting feature. ""We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts. We're working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible,"" said an Apple spokesman in a statement. The company said it will continue to take orders online. In store orders will start at 8 a.m. local time around the world on November 3.

"In fact, a proposal out of New Mexico offers a facility that spans three cities and two countries. The bi-national campus would include El Paso, Texas; Juarez, Mexico; and Las Cruces, New Mexico. The joint proposal comes from two New Mexico-based nonprofits: the Mesilla Valley Economic Development Alliance (MVEDA) and the Border Industrial Association. ""A bi-national campus that sits on the border [allows] Amazon the benefit of recruiting from two separate countries without barriers,"" said a spokesperson for MVEDA. ""We think this approach pushes the boundaries of how business has operated at a time when there is so much discussion about our border with Mexico."" Related: Gambling site has Atlanta as the favorite in the Amazon sweepstakes The campus would be divided into seven hexagons and the U.S.-Mexico border would run through the middle. The groups envision a 70,000-acre campus with office buildings, parks, bike access and retail stores. The proposal also includes a solar and wind farm that could potentially provide for the energy needs of the majority of the campus.  U.S. Border Patrol agents would be stationed on the campus, according to Davin Lopez, president and CEO of MVEDA. However, other details about how to keep the campus secure on the border will have to be discussed, he said. ""It's not unprecedented to have a private sector border crossing,"" Lopez told CNN Tech. ""With all the different discussions that are taking place in D.C. regarding amnesty and immigration ... This is a different solution. It's an opportunity for the private sector such as Amazon to be part of that answer."" ""Instead of building bridges or walls, we're building a border economy here,"" he added. If chosen, Lopez expects the new facility would boost the economies of both the U.S. and Mexico.  Related: The city Amazon picks for its second headquarters will change forever But some experts aren't convinced that such a proposal would be enough to woo Amazon. ""This is a very novel bi-national approach, but I don't think the region has enough of an advantage over other applying cities in core areas [such as] workforce scale, education levels, aviation connectivity or public transit investment,"" said Joseph Parilla, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. MVEDA argues that its joint bid checks all the boxes Amazon wants, such as a metro area with a population of over 1 million, the ability to attract technical talent and proximity to major highways and international airports. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has received 238 proposals across 54 states, provinces, districts and territories across North America. Bids have come from big metropolitan areas like New York and Los Angeles and smaller cities like Danbury, Connecticut. Atlanta is the favorite to win the new facility, according to Irish gambling site Paddy Power. The company announced plans for a second headquarters in September. It will cost at least $5 billion to construct and operate and will create as many as 50,000 jobs. Amazon plans to make a decision in 2018. CNNMoney's Julia Horowitz contributed to this report."
"Amazon sent cities into a frenzy when it announced plans to build a second headquarters, expected to cost $5 billion to construct. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) said it received 238 proposals from across the continent. Submissions came from major urban centers like New York City and Los Angeles, Canadian metro areas including Toronto, and smaller U.S. cities like Worcester, Massachusetts and Stonecrest, Georgia. ""Bringing in up to 50,000 jobs into a city is pretty much an event you can't duplicate any other way. ... It's akin to winning the lottery,"" said Steve Glickman, cofounder and executive director of the Economic Innovation Group. But hosting Amazon's new facility will also have its disadvantages. A lot depends on which city the company ultimately picks. While the project will bring high-paying jobs, it won't hit all places with equal force. In smaller cities where housing is more limited, home prices could rise. Meanwhile, big cities like New York that already employ a lot of white collar workers aren't likely to see a major economic transformation -- they'll just get richer. Related: Cities are doing wacky things to host Amazon's second headquarters A 50,000-job stimulus The expected 50,000 jobs the new headquarters will bring is impressive in and of itself. The fact that they will pay well makes the opportunity even more attractive. ""People often just count the number of jobs, but not the quality. ... These are high-quality, high-paying jobs. That is a huge benefit,"" said Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. As a result, the new facility would bring more highly-skilled workers to town. Some Amazon employees could eventually leave the company and start their own businesses in the city, according to Ravi Madhavan, a professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. ""It just takes a few people to launch a business and for one of them to become really successful,"" Madhavan said. Amazon could also act as an ""anchor"" company, and attract its suppliers or other big tech companies to the winning city. But the effect of 50,000 jobs will depend on the size of the winner's local job market. ""The smaller the town, the bigger the impact. In a city like New York with over 8 million people, the impact won't be as dramatic as a Danbury, Connecticut, as an example,"" said Rob Adams, director of Texas Venture Labs at the University of Texas at Austin. Related: 8 cities fit for Amazon's second headquarters Housing gets pricier At the same time, the city that scores the second headquarters can expect housing prices, along with other costs of living, to increase. New research from Apartment List, a site that catalogs apartment rentals across the country, forecasts an annual rent increase of up to 2% per year in the city that houses HQ2. That's on top of organic price increases that already occur from year to year. ""Rents are already rising rapidly nationwide,"" Apartment List said in a report that analyzed data from the U.S. Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Half of renters are considered ""cost burdened,"" spending 30 percent or more of their income on rent, according to the firm. Apartment List said Raleigh, Pittsburgh and San Jose would experience the highest rent increases if HQ2 comes to town. The impact would be smaller in cities like Washington D.C., Los Angeles and Dallas. The largest increase in housing costs would be in Raleigh, which wouldn't be able to build enough homes to sustain the influx of workers, according to the report. Meanwhile, housing costs would stay lower in places like Dallas, which has lax building restrictions and a cheaper labor pool. Related: Amazon could put its second HQ in Canada. But will it? The Seattle example Those curious about how Amazon can transform a city need look no further than Seattle. Though the metropolitan area is home to other major employers, such as Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) and Starbucks (SBUX), locals often attribute rising prices and congestion to the online retailer. Amazon arrived in the Seattle area in 1994. Now, home prices are rising more there than anywhere else in the country, according to the most recent data from S&P CoreLogic. In July, home prices in Seattle increased 13.5% compared to last year. In Portland -- the city with the next highest level of growth -- home prices increased 7.6%. New York, known for its tough housing market, saw prices increase 3.9%. ""A few years ago, [Seattle] was one of the most affordable West Coast markets. That's becoming less and less the case,"" said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist with online real estate company Zillow. The influx of Amazon workers has also snarled traffic and put more pressure on public transit. The Seattle Times reported that the local transit service had to add buses this summer to accommodate all of Amazon's interns. And then there's the construction. Constant building is a sign of economic growth, but it can also change the character of a city. In May 2017, Seattle was home to 58 cranes -- far and away the highest count in the country, according to the Rider Levett Bucknall Crane Index. Amazon now occupies a staggering 19% of all prime office space in the city, according to an analysis conducted by the Seattle Times. ""I hope that cities eager to lure Amazon's second headquarters are ready for the Amazon fallout we've experienced in Seattle: skyrocketing housing costs that push residents out of the homebuying and rental markets; worsening traffic gridlock; an increased gap between the rich, middle class and poor; and the dulling of any unique local character that the city is desperately trying to retain,"" Susan Fairo of Seattle wrote the Seattle Times in a letter to the editor published Sept. 15. For its part, Amazon estimates that its investments in Seattle from 2010 through 2016 added $38 billion to the city's economy, which was worth $330 billion in 2016. Will it be worth it? So will the benefits of HQ2 outweigh the costs? Depends on the city -- and the tax incentives and other perks they offer. ""A city or state has to be careful not to give so many tax benefits that they give away their actual advantage that they had in getting Amazon,"" Jensen said. To pay for local tax cuts, cities may have to raise taxes elsewhere or cut spending on public services like education and infrastructure. For that reason, cities and states should push Amazon to invest in these services as part of their agreement, according to Megan Randall, a researcher with the Tax Policy Center. They should also bake in provisions to ensure the promised high-paying jobs actually materialize. Overall, HQ2 will be a ""net positive"" for the winning city, said John Lettieri, cofounder and senior director for policy and strategy at the Economic Innovation Group. ""[But] it should be tied to a larger, more robust economic development strategy, where this is a means to a broader end than just winning Amazon itself,"" he said."
"Both mothers and fathers will now have 12 weeks of paid leave, up from six weeks under the previous policy. Mothers who give birth get an additional six to eight weeks off under medical disability coverage. Parents have up to a year to take the leave, with extra flexibility for scheduling the additional time off for employees whose children were born months ago. ""The market is changing and we're watching what other companies are doing,"" said said Barbara Brickmeier, vice president of benefits at IBM. ""It's important to keep women in the work force."" Related: Paid parental leave may be one of the few ideas to transcend politics She added that the additional benefits were also in response to requests from employees. IBM is also beefing up a number of other benefits for parents. It is increasing financial assistance for parents adopting children to up to $20,000 to cover those costs, from the previous $5,000 benefit, and it is making that benefit available to parents who use a surrogate to have a child. Additionally, it's expanding a program for mothers who are traveling abroad for work to let them ship breast milk home for free using temperature-controlled packaging. Previously the program was available only to mothers traveling within the U.S.. Employees based in some foreign countries also will be able to use the program for the first time. The extended leave policies apply to both full-time and part-time U.S. employees. The company has 380,000 employees worldwide, but does not disclose how many are based in the United States."
"Here's why you should care: A handful of tech companies have power and influence as editorial gatekeepers and amplifiers. That power is growing and, increasingly, it's coming under scrutiny. This week, executives from Twitter (TWTR, Tech30), Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Google (GOOG) were grilled on Capitol Hill. The topic at hand: Were the platforms weaponized by a hostile nation to affect the 2016 presidential election? And then, while we're asking if tech companies have too much power, an employee at one of those companies was able to take the President's Twitter microphone away. Trump's account only disappeared for 11 minutes. But it was a telling moment and has become part of the conversation about tech companies and their uncomfortable (and seemingly uncontrollable) role as gatekeepers. Some lawmakers -- not to mention the public -- believe the companies aren't always just neutral platforms, and that they are not transparent enough about how they work and the decisions they make. Related: How did this happen? 3 questions for Twitter after it deleted Trump's account A Twitter employee with the power to silence the president may be an extreme example, but every day the company makes decisions on content. The gatekeepers are increasingly being asked to explain those decisions. Internally, Twitter is scrambling to figure out what happened with @RealDonaldTrump on Thursday night. The company will probably add new safeguards so fewer employees can access an account like Trump's going forward, but it's a moment worth looking at. On Thursday, Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) CEO Jack Dorsey sent two separate emails to employees that were obtained by CNN. ""We are working to understand what happened and will share more as we know more. We are taking steps to make sure this can't happen again,"" he wrote in one. No matter what steps they take in the immediate aftermath of this, though, the fundamental questions will remain: How much power should these companies have over speech? And are they able to control the platforms they've built? One Twitter employee with whom CNN spoke expressed frustration that the president could tweet about North Korea in a way that potentially increases the likelihood of hostilities -- which could be interpreted as inciting violence, a violation of Twitter's terms of service -- and that Twitter would do nothing about it. But another employee told CNN that, from a policy perspective, Trump hasn't violated the rules of Twitter and won't get kicked off it -- at least not by someone who isn't a rogue employee. ""Twitter's core job is to keep people informed, he's held to the same rules as everyone else,"" this employee said. Related: Conservatives in Silicon Valley speak in shadows Tough questions like what Twitter should do about Trump's use of the service are emblematic of an era in which decisions made behind closed doors in Silicon Valley are perceived as political -- and often do have a direct effect on politics, even if that's not the intention. Being the referee of free speech is difficult, and the stakes are high. ""I think it is really risky if you have a group of essentially 10 tech CEOs, that if you somehow offend all 10 of them, that you can effectively not be on the internet anymore,"" Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince told CNN recently, referring to his own decision to kick The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site, off his platform. Trump has been a divisive president, but he didn't have to bother all 10 tech CEOs to lose his spot on one of their platforms. Twitter had enabled an employee to make that decision instead. It was for only 11 minutes, but it matters because it shows that even the president isn't immune. ""We have a lot more work to do,"" Dorsey said in his second email, thanking employees for trying to get to the bottom of Twitter's latest drama. "
"President Trump's Twitter account briefly went offline Thursday night. Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) later said it was deactivated by a customer support employee on his or her last day at the company. The incident has raised concerns about whether random Twitter employees have the power not just to suspend the president's account, but also take it over. Twitter declined to comment beyond its tweets on the incident released Thursday. A source close to Twitter told CNN that this particular employee would not have had the ability to access or tweet from another user's account. It's unclear if the employee in question was full-time or not. The New York Times reported Friday that the person was a contractor. Twitter did not return requests for comment on the Times story. In a tweet on Friday, Twitter said it has ""implemented safeguards to prevent this from happening again"" and was conducting a ""full"" review of the incident. Multiple former Twitter employees threw cold water on the notion that random staffers could post from Trump's account, or any other. ""Nobody can tweet from those accounts,"" a former Twitter executive told CNN. A former Twitter engineer, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, called it ""highly unlikely"" that a Twitter employee could get access to Trump's account, but noted it was theoretically possible, at least as of a couple years ago. Any access would need to be logged, however, especially for a VIP account. As for checking direct messages employees would need to get legal permissions. The source close to Twitter said the company regularly updates and improves its security measures, and cautioned against assuming that what was true two years ago remains true today. Related: How did this happen? 3 questions for Twitter after it deleted Trump's account According to another former Twitter employee, additional controls were put on Trump's account after the election. Twitter tightened the circle of people who could access it. A former consultant for Twitter told CNN that employees who review accounts for abuse typically have the power to suspend users. The consultant said that many of these employees tend to be relatively junior ¡ª a common practice across social media firms. There's ""just a tool that naturally a small group of people for safety and abuse and hacking etc have access to that got abused by one person for eleven minutes,"" the former Twitter executive told CNN. When CNN asked if some VIP accounts require greater clearance to suspend or remove than others, another former Twitter executive replied: ""You'd think,"" followed by a sad face emoji. -- CNN's Samuel Burke and Laurie Segall contributed to this report."
"The social network on Friday outlined how it defines harassment and threats, and its policy toward adult content. Twitter also said it will now send an email explaining which policy has been violated when it suspends an account. Last month, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey promised more transparency and aggressive policies after actress Rose McGowan's account was temporarily blocked for violating Twitter polices. Although some users assumed she was suspended for tweeting about the Harvey Weinstein scandal, Twitter later said the action was taken because she posted someone's phone number -- a policy violation. ""Online behavior continues to evolve and change, and at Twitter, we have to ensure those changes are reflected in our rules in a way that's easy to adhere to and understand,"" the company wrote in a blog post. Related: Twitter: Employee briefly shut down Trump's account Twitter's rules now explicitly say threats to expose someone's personally identifiably information are banned, such as a home address or Social Security number. It's also known as ""doxxing."" The terms outline that users cannot make unwanted sexual advances on its platform or engage in child sex exploitation. Also banned: wishing for the death, serious harm or disease of a person or group of people. The promotion of self-harm or suicide is also prohibited. Although the company still allows some graphic violence and adult content, it will continue to push out a warning and asks users to opt in to view. Twitter is taking this a step forward by cracking down on this type of content in live video, profile or header images. The company has long been criticized for not taking effective action against hate speech and harassment on its platform -- and it continues to walk a sensitive line. For example, it aims to police harassment but positions itself as a service that celebrates free speech. Meanwhile, Twitter's own internal controls have been brought into the spotlight this week following news that an employee temporarily deleted President Trump's account. Twitter's latest is a part of its ""safety calendar"" it made public two weeks ago, which tells people when to expect policy updates. Later this month, Twitter said it will explain how it will review and enforce its policies. It will also share an updated version of its rules that includes new rules around violent groups and hateful images."
"Saipov also passed Lyft's background check -- and made 180 trips using the service, the company said. On Tuesday, Saipov allegedly killed 8 people driving a rented pickup truck to mow down cyclists on a busy Manhattan bike path. Records show Saipov had received traffic citations in the past, but Uber and Lyft said they were not disqualifying based on its criteria or under local and state law in New Jersey. News of the attack is nevertheless again drawing attention to how the companies vet their drivers. Both companies still mostly shun the idea of fingerprinting drivers. However, they've made some exceptions like in New York City, where Uber and Lyft drivers are fingerprinted because they are subject to the same standards as taxi drivers. Although the criteria for background checks varies by state, Uber mostly conducts digital background checks via a startup called Checkr. Lyft contracts with Sterling Talent Solutions for screenings. Both background check companies did not comment. According to its website, Checkr screens applicants by using Social Security numbers to identify associated addresses. It then reviews driving and criminal histories in national, state and local databases. Those databases include the U.S. Department of Justice National Sex Offender Public Website and ones that flag suspected terrorists. Sterling checks similar databases. Checkr and Sterling are bound by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law that regulates how reporting agencies use a person's information. Still, Uber makes the final call on whether to hire a driver based on Checkr's screening results, a source familiar with Checkr said. It's unclear what Lyft's decision making process is. In general, Uber drivers can't have DUIs or major moving violations within the last seven years. They're also not permitted to have more than three minor violations, such as speeding tickets, within the past three years. Drivers also can't have a criminal record that includes a conviction for a felony, violent crime or sexual offenses in the last seven years. Uber does not list on its website every type of driving incident or violation that would disqualify drivers. Lyft re-runs background and DMV checks for drivers annually. Uber doesn't have such a policy. Related: New York attack suspect drove for Lyft as well as Uber Many drivers work for both Uber and Lyft. While the companies follow similar guidelines, it's not uncommon for a driver to pass a background check for one company and not the other, according to Harry Campbell, who blogs at The Rideshare Guy and drives for both companies. ""It is not consistent,"" Campbell told CNN Tech. ""It shows you there are definitely some discrepancies. It's a gray area."" Further complicating matters: The background process varies by state, too. For example, Massachusetts runs government background checks on drivers who are already approved to work for Uber and Lyft. Thousands of drivers failed these government screenings for inappropriate criminal charges and driving histories. While most states do not do government checks on drivers, some advocates think they should. ""Governments should be running background checks on Uber and Lyft drivers, not the companies themselves,"" said Dave Sutton, spokesman for ""Who's Driving You?"" an initiative from the Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association. ""Uber and Lyft's background checks consistently miss things."" Last week in Chicago, Lyft acknowledged it approved a driver with a federal conviction for aiding someone with ties to terrorism. Lyft said the man should not have passed the background check, and this was due to an error made by its screening provider. Lyft said it deactivated the driver and is re-running background checks on all drivers in Chicago ""out of an abundance of caution."" However, the man did not pass screening by Uber, which said he was rejected ""and barred from ever joining the Uber platform."" Related: 8,000 drivers fail Massachusetts background check Uber said it is quickly and aggressively reviewing Saipov's history with the company. So far, it hasn't found any safety reports that raise concerns. Lyft also didn't find any red flags associated with his account. His last background check with Uber was in July 2017 -- and he passed. His previous driving offenses include one in Platte, Missouri, for failing to equip a motor vehicle carrier with or maintain a required brake system, according to online records. Saipov also wasn't on any U.S. government terror watchlists, according to two sources familiar with the investigation. In addition, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Counterterrorism and Intelligence John Miller said Saipov was not the subject of NYPD Intelligence Bureau or FBI investigations. Both Uber and Lyft are in contact with law enforcement authorities over the attack, the companies confirmed. -- CNN's David Shortell contributed reporting."
"The new House tax bill would do away with a tax credit of up to $7,500 for plug-in vehicle purchases. If the bill passes, the credit will only apply to electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles purchased through the end of this year. The change comes just as longer range, lower-priced electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the redesigned Nissan Leaf are hitting the market. Tesla is also just starting to roll out its Model 3 which, with a starting price of $35,000 for a stripped down model, aims to attract new buyers to the EV marketplace. The tax credit is capped at the first 200,000 electric vehicles that each manufacturer sells overall. No manufacturer has reached that threshold yet, but Tesla is expected to run out of tax credits for its customers some time next year. The tax credit is most important to buyers in the mid-range part of the market, said Michelle Krebs, a senior industry analyst with AutoTrader. Until now, the high-priced Tesla (TSLA) Model S has been the top-selling electric vehicle in the U.S., and for buyers willing to spend six figures for a car, the tax incentive probably wasn't that big of a deal. Currently, plug-in cars are a tiny, but growing, part of the automotive marketplace. For EV sales to grow beyond the committed ""green car"" audience requires incentives for now, she said. Getting more people to buy EVs has helped lower battery prices, because more battery factories are coming on line. It's also created more demand for more public charging stations so they are being built. These developments should make electric cars more attractive to buyers even without incentives, but that will take time. General Motors (GM) executives have said that they are preparing for a future in which all cars will be electric. Doing away with tax credits could hamper those plans. ""Tax credits are an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles. Because General Motors believes in an all-electric future, we will work with Congress to explore ways to maintain this incentive,"" the automaker said in a statement. Krebs said she's not optimistic the credit will survive. She and her colleagues have long thought it would not likely last through the current Republican administration, she said. In a statement, the Electric Drive Transportation Association said it was extremely disappointed with the news. ""Abolishing the plug-in credit will hurt consumers who want electric options and threaten the economic potential of the electric drive industry, which already employs more than 215,000 Americans,"" said Genevieve Cullen, president of Electric Drive Transportation Association. ""The tax credit is also critical to our energy security, providing an alternative to dependence on the world oil market."""
"To start, it wants to make more eye contact than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to overlook this to have its small, powerful cameras in my back pocket. Apple (AAPL, Tech30)'s latest iPhone, which hit stores on Friday, introduces some of the biggest changes to its smartphone line since it was first launched 10 years ago. Gone is the Home button that doubled as as a fingerprint sensor. It's replaced with face detection and new gestures for getting around. The screen itself pushes much closer to the edges of the device, and the camera is fantastic. I've been using and testing the iPhone X all week. But more than any other iPhone upgrade, it takes some getting used to. Apple has changed the way key features work, primarily to cram more screen onto a small phone. It also cranked up the price tag to $999 for the 64 GB model and $1149 for the 256 GB version. Face detection is neat, but is it necessary? Unlocking the device with Face ID is the most hyped new feature on the iPhone X. However, it's not a terribly compelling reason to buy the device. The collection of cameras and sensors takes a 3D scan of your face to make sure you're who you say you are. It then unlocks the phone. It also replaces the fingerprint sensor to make room for the screen. You can also enter a passcode or turn off the security features altogether. In my tests, Face ID was impressive but not perfect. My phone unlocked in a variety of lighting situations, but there were a multiple times when it just wouldn't read my face. It feels slower than using a fingerprint. After it confirms your face, you're stuck staring at the lock screen until you swipe up to get into the device. A setting on other iPhones lets you go directly to your home screen when it's unlocked with a finger. That's not an option for your face. Perhaps I'm lazy, but I don't want to lift up the device every time I use it. It will also make checking Instagram during meetings harder, too. On an iPhone 8 and earlier models, a finger scan made unlocking easy. The iPhone X is not the first smartphone to add face detection. Samsung's Galaxy S8 has a similar but less secure feature. Apple has made a far superior version of the technology. Still, unlocking a phone with your face feels like an answer to a question nobody asked. Other uses for your face The technology behind Face ID has other impressive uses. My favorite is the addition of the Portrait mode to the front-facing camera. Using Face ID technology, the iPhone X takes beautiful selfies with a blurred out background and dramatic lighting effects, just like the back camera. Apple's new ""Attention"" features are a clever touch, too. If you're staring at the phone, say reading a webpage, the phone knows you're paying attention and will keep the display from automatically dimming or shutting off. It also automatically lowers the ringer volume. Of course, there's also Animoji, a collection of 12 animated emoji characters that mimic your expressions by tracking up to 50 different muscle movements. It's cute but an ultimately forgettable feature. What it does best is demonstrate what other apps can do with the Face ID cameras. Snapchat is already using the technology to add masks that look like they're part of your face, and that's just the start. It'll be interesting to see what other developers do with it. Related: iPhone X goes on sale around the world The main camera is a bit better, but it's all about size The most popular selling point for Apple's top-of-the-line iPhone is that it has the best camera. The iPhone X has a slightly better camera than the iPhone 8 Plus, packed into a smaller body. More than face detection or a larger screen, this might be what convinces people to spend $999 on the iPhone X. The iPhone X also has dual lenses, but the telephoto lens has an f 2.4 aperture and adds image stabilization. You might notice that lower-light photos have less blur as a result. But for the most part, the images from an iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X are close in quality. About that screen Apple has fit a large of a screen onto the phone in a way that doesn't make it feel huge. It's just slightly larger than the iPhone 8 with a 5.8-inch display that's taller and more narrow than the iPhone 8 Plus screen. The combination comes with some odd tradeoffs. The corners of the screen are rounded, which crops parts of any movie or photo you're viewing. The Face ID cameras and sensors are also in a small black rectangle on the front of the device, which cuts into the top of the screen. There is a tiny bit of usable display left on each side of this notch where you can see the time or how much battery you have left. But if you watch a movie full screen, the notch creates a distracting dead space. I opted to make videos smaller rather than look at it. This is Apple's first OLED screen, which shows more vivid colors and can be thinner than an LCD screen. The colors pop and images are sharp, but if you glance at it from an angle, it displays a blue-ish hue. This is a known issue with OLED screens, but it's surprising that Apple didn't think it was a deal breaker. A learning curve that isn't very Apple To fill the void left by the Home button, the iPhone X has added new gestures (the different swipes you make with a finger). The process of learning them is a pain, and some of the new options are more work than before. Instead of pressing the button once to go back to your home screen, you do a small swipe up from the bottom of the display. Another example: To bring up the Control Center, you swipe down from the top-right corner of the device, which is out of the way for most thumbs. I don't doubt anyone's ability to master a few new finger movements. But these changes feel like a move away from the dead-simple interface that's made the iPhone the easiest smartphone to use. OK, but should I buy it? If you want the best smartphone camera but find the iPhone 8 Plus size to be too bulky, the iPhone X is a solid choice. Early adopters and and selfie fans will likely find joy in the front-facing camera's features and integration with apps in the future. Overall, you must be comfortable re-learning some navigation basics and have no qualms about dropping a few hundred dollars extra on it too. But because the iPhone X is Apple's vision of the future, these features and design choices will likely show up in more devices soon, like it or not."
"Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Angus King of Maine both used that term this week to describe Russian accounts and advertising that sowed division among Americans by promoting fake news and even protests. ""This country has to have some kind of cyberwarfare deterrent capacity,"" King said at an Intelligence Committee hearing. ""Right now, there's no price to be paid for meddling in our democracy."" But there's no explicit definition or legal framework in the United States for what constitutes cyberwar. So far, there are no reports of physical injury as a result of the Russian campaigns. Two protests organized by Russian trolls in Texas were reportedly non-violent. But they targeted American democracy by relying on Facebook and Twitter's power to share information to large audiences. Andrea Little Limbago, chief social scientist at the security firm Endgame and former analyst at the Defense Department, says the word ""cyberwar"" is overused. Related: McCain: Russian cyberintrusions an 'act of war' ""We need to change how we think about this because it's not helping and we leave everything so vague,"" Limbago said. There are a number of digital tools one country can use to target another: A hack that penetrates computers, ransomware and malware that destroy files, social media manipulation that distributes false information. Sometimes these tools are used together. Online hacks could have real-life consequences. Earlier this year, NSA director Admiral Michael Rogers highlighted two worst-case scenarios for cyberattacks: Outright destruction of critical infrastructure, such as shutting down a power grid to create chaos, and data manipulation on a massive scale. NATO could consider cyberattacks a potential trigger for Article 5, the organization's mutual defense agreement. This means allied countries could respond to a cyberattack with force. Because there are no rules for how to respond to threats, there's no clear way to handle certain threats and challenges, Limbago said. ""We should focus on what happened, what the effects were, and what tools in our foreign policy tool belt we have to respond,"" she said. Related: Fake black activist accounts linked to Russian government Two U.S. representatives recently introduced a ""hack back"" bill to make it legal for companies to retaliate against hackers, unrelated to foreign policy regarding cyberwar. Security experts agree the bill could have serious negative consequences, such as accidentally targeting innocent third-parties. In 2016, King co-sponsored a bill, the Cyber Act of War Act, to define what constitutes cyberwar. It didn't pass, but it would have given the president the power to determine when the effects of a cyberattack are equal to those of a traditional war with conventional weapons. In August, the U.S. approved sanctions on Russia following election interference and human rights violations. Some experts said the response was inadequate. Related: Facebook, Twitter, Google face aggressive questioning at Senate hearing Actions could include publicly attributing groups or individuals behind the attacks, increased sanctions against the country, and formally charging members of intelligence agencies who played a role in the actions, according to Eric Rosenbach, director of Harvard's Defending Digital Democracy Project and former chief of staff to the Secretary of Defense. ""You could work your way up to even more aggressive [moves] such as a counter-cyberattack,"" he said. ""But you'd have to think about that very carefully."" ""We definitely aren't doing enough,"" Rosenbach said. From Washington to Silicon Valley, experts say Russia's actions in the 2016 election are not a one-time activity. Hackers targeted this year's French election, and Spanish media reported on Russian influence in the run-up to the Catalan independence referendum on October 1. Lawmakers want to make sure it doesn't happen again. ""The U.S. needs to take leadership in how to counter this kind of weaponized information across the board,"" Limbago said. ""There are plenty of other governments copying what Russia is doing."""
"A report released this week from the National Association of City Transportation Officials, a nonprofit representing cities on transportation issues, lays out a vision for the future of city streets as autonomous vehicles arrive. Some cities look to NACTO for recommendations, but it's unclear if cities will adopt its guidance. The blueprint suggests generally limiting self-driving vehicles to 20 mph and allowing pedestrians to cross streets anywhere, rather than only at intersection crosswalks. The speed restriction would be a noticeable decline in top speeds in many cities. This may extend trip times in vehicles. The technology in self-driving cars will be able to identify when a person is trying to cross a street, and slow down. This could impact the concept of jaywalking. ""The instinctive human act of walking straight to one's destination, pejoratively known as 'jaywalking,' becomes simply 'walking,'"" write the authors. The organization sees the adoption of autonomous vehicles as a chance to rethink how streets function. Under its plan, the big benefactors are those most vulnerable on roads: pedestrians and bicyclists. When pedestrians want to cross a street, it's not uncommon for them to walk several hundred feet out of their way. This wasn't always the case. A century ago, when cars first emerged, crossing a street mid-block was normal. Related: How free self-driving rides could change everything In 1920, the term ""jaywalker"" was controversial, according Peter D. Norton, author of ""In Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City."" It was popularized as a putdown for someone who didn't know how to walk properly in a city. In some cases, Boy Scouts handed out cards to jaywalkers, alerting them of their risky behavior. In 1925, a law passed in Los Angeles making the move illegal and police arrested some offenders. Jaywalking is still generally illegal, but not the rule is often not enforced. If streets are occupied by self-driving cars in the future, perhaps the biggest shift in city culture, according to NACTO, would be how easy it would be to cross streets. But the report warns that the future could also play out differently, depending on city and government policies. Traffic and emissions could skyrocket, and pedestrians could be forced to cross streets on bridges. Current transportation systems could also be replaced by new services that aren't as affordable or accessible. The Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets -- which represents self-driving vehicle companies such as Ford, Uber, Waymo and Volvo -- said in a statement responding to the report that autonomous vehicles should be able to follow the rules of the road, such as speed limits. Individual self-driving car companies declined to comment. Experts believe self-driving vehicles will significantly change city life, but many details are yet to be worked out. Cities may find themselves weighing tradeoffs, choosing whether to prioritize vehicles, pedestrians and other uses of streets. ""We have a historic opportunity to reclaim the street and to correct the mistakes of a century of urban planning,"" said Janette Sadik-Khan, NACTO's chair, and the former commissioner of New York City's transportation department, in the report."
"The manhunt led investigators to the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek, where three of the Paris attackers lived. News outlets called the neighborhood ""Jihadi Central."" It was also Ouassari's hometown. ""I just wanted to call the media and say, 'This is the wrong photo,'"" said Ouassari, the 39-year-old son of Moroccan immigrants. ""I never would have thought these guys from my part of town could do something like that. I started to do some reflection."" After the attacks, he sought a way to cut down on the stigma surrounding the community. He opened a coding school and tech incubator called MolenGeek. It has since attracted funding from companies like Google and Samsung. Classes are free. The city, known for its reputation of organized crime, hasn't made it easy for young people with good ideas to pursue careers. Ouassari's goal was to offer an alternative for those who wanted to get ahead. The classes aren't taught like a typical school. Sessions on coding, website development and engineering are conducted in small groups or one-on-one trainings. About 600 students, varying in age, have enrolled since it launched. Although the school doesn't charge students to attend, they're asked to pay with time. This includes helping to keep the school clean and coming back to speak to classes. ""The criteria is motivation,"" Oussari says. ""We don't need people with a lot of skills. We need people who want to share and be a real part of this community, who want to change something in their life."" MolenGeek caught the attention of Belgium's Vice Prime Minister Alexander de Croo, who oversees the country's counter terrorism program. He started supporting the school with funds. ""One of the measures is to see just how many people are part of the community, [and] month after month more people are coming there,"" De Croo told CNN Tech. ""There are projects are moving out from the school and trying to become businesses."" For example, an app developed at MolenGeek called QuickLyric, which serves up song lyrics, has already become a hit in Belgium. It's been downloaded a half a million times across all mobile platforms, according to MolenGeek.  Related: Millennials are shaking up these 7 industries Although tech companies have poured money into the center, some said the interest stems from not what comes out the program but the mission itself.

Ouassari recently returned from the U.S. where he spoke at the U.N. about best practices for public-private partnerships. But his biggest problem is now an obstacle any successful startup faces: scaling up. He wants to open centers in more countries.

"The first car from the new brand, called Polestar, will be a limited-edition plug-in hybrid with an electric driving range of 93 miles. Only 500 of these cars, called the Polestar 1, will be built starting in mid-2019. In all-electric mode, the Polestar 1 will use two electric motors driving the back wheel making a total of 218 horsepower. A total of 600 horsepower will be available using the four-cylinder engine that will power the front wheels. Many of the car's body parts will be made from carbon fiber, a lightweight but expensive material. Polestar's second car, Polestar 2, will be a fully electric car designed to compete directly against the Tesla Model 3, Volvo said. Polestar 3 will be a fully electric SUV. The cars will be built in a factory in China financed by Volvo's parent company, Zhejiang Geely Holding. (GELYF) They'll share much of their engineering with Volvo, but will still be substantially different, the company said. The Polestar 1, for instance, will share about half its parts with Volvo cars. Polestar was originally the name of a separate Swedish company, Polestar Performance, that created race-tuned versions of Volvo cars. Volvo bought that company in 2015 and added its name to performance-tuned versions of its own cars. Those cars carried a Polestar badge in addition to the Volvo badge. Polestar will now be a completely separate car brand offered in separate dealerships from Volvo cars, but these cars won't be for sale Instead, they'll only be offered a lease-like subscription basis. Monthly payments will include costs such as maintenance and insurance and even the temporary use of rental cars. Volvo has said that, beginning in 2019, all of its own new and redesigned models will be electric or hybrid."
"The email, first reported on by Wired and obtained by CNN Tech, details where the policy updates stand -- including plans to treat hateful imagery and hate symbols on the platform as ""sensitive media."" As with adult content and graphic violence on the platform, the content will be blurred and individuals will need to manually opt to view. But what Twitter considers to be a hate symbol isn't detailed in the email. Two other new categories that Twitter broke out: Violent groups, or organizations that use or have historically used violence to advance their causes, as well as tweets that ""glorify"" or ""condone"" violence. The company says that it already takes action against threats like ""I'm going to kill you"" (though how effective it has been at doing this has been up for debate). But, as part of the policy update, it said it will soon take action against tweets that are perhaps more vague, but no less threatening, such as ""Murdering <x group of people> makes sense. That way they won't be a drain on social services."" The company, which is toeing a sensitive line as it works to police harassment on its platform while positioning itself as a service that celebrates free speech, notes these three new categories will be fleshed out in more detail. It said it plans to roll out the finalized updates in the coming weeks. Related: Twitter CEO says new rules coming to curb harassment ""We hope our approach and upcoming changes, as well as our collaboration with the Trust and Safety Council, show how seriously we are rethinking our rules and how quickly we're moving to update our policies and how we enforce them,"" Twitter said in a statement. The swift action comes after an outcry from users last week when actress Rose McGowan's account was temporarily blocked for violating Twitter polices. Twitter said she tweeted a phone number. McGowan had been very engaged on the platform in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, posting tweets including an accusation that Weinstein raped her. And users weren't happy. Many reacted to her suspension with a hashtag #WomenBoycottTwitter. This is just the latest complaint against the company, though, which has long been criticized for not taking effective action against hate speech and harassment on its platform. In addition to the new categories outlined in the email, Twitter also plans to make significant updates to existing policies around non-consensual nudity and unwanted sexual advances on the platform. Notably, any individual can report something they suspect is non-consensual intimate photo of someone: ""Given that people appearing in this content often do not know the material exists, we will not require a report from a target in order to remove it,"" the email reads. It will also widen the scope of what is considered non-consensual nudity to include ""creep shots,"" or images taken with cameras angled up a person's skirt."
"Revenge porn is the term for the spread of intimate, nude or sexual images that are distributed without a person's consent -- and it is an epidemic in Australia. One in five Australians between the ages of 16 and 49 are affected, according to a recent study. Facebook's head of global safety shared details about its new pilot program with the Australian eSafety Commissioner's Office and other experts in a blog post on Thursday. The pilot works in collaboration with eSafety's new online reporting portal announced in October, a part of a $4.8 million effort to crack down on the problem. Here's how it works: If a user suspects that they're the target of revenge porn, they alert the eSafety commission. Next, they can send the image or images to themselves on Facebook Messenger so that Facebook can register and block them from being posted. Related: Australia takes on revenge porn The Commissioner's office notifies Facebook (FB, Tech30) that the images are submitted. Then, Facebook reviews and ""hashes"" the image, which creates a numerical fingerprint of it that's stored and used to prevent anyone from ever uploading the picture across Facebook, Messenger or Instagram. ""If someone tries to upload the image to our platform, like all photos on Facebook, it is run through a database of these hashes, and if it matches we do not allow it to be posted or shared,"" the company said in a blog post. The company said the program is a ""small pilot"" to explore ""a protective measure that can help prevent a much worse scenario where an image is shared more widely."" This program could be risky. But, said Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos in a tweet, ""We are trying to balance against the serious, real world harm that occurs every day."" Stamos also cautioned users, saying, ""We are not asking random people to submit their nudes. This is a test to provide *some* option to victims to take back control."""
"Looking at cybercriminal black markets and public forums, the company found millions of usernames and passwords stolen directly through hacking. It also uncovered billions usernames and passwords indirectly exposed in third-party data breaches. For one year, Google researchers investigated the different ways hackers steal personal information and take over Google (GOOG) accounts. Google published its research, conducted between March 2016 and March 2017, on Thursday. Focusing exclusively on Google accounts and in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley, researchers created an automated system to scan public websites and criminal forums for stolen credentials. The group also investigated over 25,000 criminal hacking tools, which it received from undisclosed sources. Google said it is the first study taking a long term and comprehensive look at how criminals steal your data, and what tools are most popular. ""One of the interesting things [we found] was the sheer scale of information on individuals that's out there and accessible to hijackers,"" Kurt Thomas, security researcher at Google told CNN Tech. Even if someone has no malicious hacking experience, he or she could find all the tools they need on criminal hacker forums. Related: Google strengthens security to keep you from getting phished Data breaches, such as the recent Equifax hack, are the most common ways hackers can get your data. In one year, researchers found 1.9 billion usernames and passwords exposed by breaches. The company continued to study this through September 2017 and found a total of 3.3 billion credentials. But digital criminals can be much more proactive in stealing your information. Two popular methods are phishing, which is posing as a trustworthy person or entity to trick you into giving up your information; and keylogging, or recording what you type on your computer. Google researchers identified 788,000 potential victims of keylogging and 12.4 million potential victims of phishing. These types of attacks happen all the time. For example on average, the phishing tools Google studied collect 234,887 potentially valid login credentials, and the keylogging tools collected 14,879 credentials, each week. Because passwords are not often enough to access online accounts, cyber criminals are trying to collect other data, too. Researchers found that some phishers try and siphon location, phone numbers, or other sensitive data while stealing login credentials. Mark Risher, director of product management at Google, said this was one of the study's key findings. Google can automatically recognize when you're logging in from somewhere unusual -- if the company sees you attempting to login from Russia when you usually login from California, Google will ask to verify it's you. As a result, Google has tightened the location radius around what it considers to be usual login areas. Related: Why hacks like Equifax will keep happening Google has also implemented additional layers of email security on its official Gmail app. The company said that applying the research insights to its security protections prevented 67 million Google accounts from being abused. Last month, the company launched a handful of tools for people to further protect themselves, including a personalized account security checkup, new phishing warnings, and the Advanced Protection Program for Google's most at-risk users. Although experts have suggested using multi-factor authentication (a layer of security in addition to your password) for a long time, public adoption lags behind. According to recent data from Duo Security, most Americans don't implement the extra layer of protection. But that might be changing. Risher said Google is seeing more people adopt less convenient options in order to keep themselves safe. For example, Google said Amazon sold out of the Advanced Protection Program kits soon after they launched. The kit contains two physical security keys a person would be required to have in order to access to their account. Google said it is sharing its latest findings so other companies can also implement better protections to guard against account hijacking. ""We talk a lot about how airlines don't compete over which one crashes more frequently,"" Risher said. ""Likewise, we don't think security is something to keep to ourselves."""
"Mayer, the former CEO of Yahoo, testified before a Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday about a security breach that compromised three billion user accounts, making it the single largest breach in history. ""As CEO, these thefts occurred during my tenure and I want to sincerely apologize to each and every one of our users,"" Mayer said in opening remarks at the Senate hearing. The breach took place in August, 2013 and was disclosed by Yahoo in 2016. Yahoo initially said it impacted more than one billion accounts. Verizon, which acquired Yahoo in June, revealed last month that the breach actually compromised all accounts. At the data breach hearing, which also featured the current and former CEOs of Equifax (EFX), Mayer was pressed on why it took so long to disclose the breach and how it could have underestimated the impact by billions of accounts. Related: Why Marissa Mayer couldn't save Yahoo ""Yahoo did not know of the intrusion in 2013. We learned of the intrusion by files presented to us in 2016,"" Mayer said. She deflected the increased estimate by noting it was revealed after her tenure at the company had ended. Mayer left Yahoo when the acquisition closed in June. She walked away from the company with nearly $260 million at the time in stock and severance. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, called it ""unfathomable to the average person"" that the CEOs of Yahoo or Equifax could walk away with ""possibly a quarter of a billion dollars"" despite the data security failures. ""You harm consumers and you walk away with the amount of money that a small city or county uses for their annual operating budget,"" Schatz said. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, pressed the Yahoo and Equifax executives on whether consumers can expect their data to be safer today in the wake of the breaches. Verizon's chief privacy officer, Karen Zacharia, stumbled and stopped short of saying yes. In her remarks, Mayer said companies are effectively in an ""arms race"" with private hackers and state-sponsored actors as their methods ""become more sophisticated."" ""The threat from state-sponsored attacks has changed the playing field so dramatically that today I believe all companies, even the most well defended ones, could fall victim to these crimes,"" Mayer said. The Justice Department previously indicted two Russian spies for a separate 2014 breach of Yahoo's data. The source of the 2013 breach remains unknown."
"But now Spiegel seems to be admitting to some significant flaws in his vision. After Snap (SNAP) released its earnings report on Tuesday, Spiegel got on a conference call with analysts and acknowledged a series of mistakes and shortcomings. In no particular order: The messaging app is too difficult to use. The company hasn't done enough to attract users on Android, the dominant platform in many international markets. And its transition to an automated advertising system has been bumpier than expected for sales. The problems were evident in Snap's dismal third quarter results. Its losses more than tripled, sales fell short of Wall Street's estimates and the audience has flatlined. Snapchat added just 4.5 million new daily active users in the three month period. Spiegel is now planning to redesign the Snapchat app. Or to put that another way: Snap is planning a massive overhaul of its core product and primary moneymaker just eight months after it raised billions in a public offering. Call it the corporate equivalent of a Hail Mary pass. ""There is a strong likelihood that the redesign of our application will be disruptive to our business in the short term, and we don't yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application,"" Spiegel said on the call. Related: Snapchat plans major redesign as user growth stalls The stock dipped as much as 20% in after hours trading Tuesday. Snap pared its losses somewhat Wednesday on news of Chinese tech giant Tencent amassing a 10% stake in the company, but shares were still down 15% in early trading. So how could Snap and Spiegel have gotten it so wrong? The answer may be a mix of hubris and shortsightedness. Consider Spiegel's response to yet another setback: Spectacles. The smart sunglasses marked Snap's first foray into hardware and enjoyed some buzz early on. But on Tuesday, Snap said it was taking a nearly $40 million writedown for excess inventory of the product after misjudging demand. ""We were very excited about Spectacles by the initial reception, [and] because we were so excited we made I guess the wrong decision,"" Spiegel said on the call. ""Ultimately, we weren't able to sell as many Spectacles as we thought we had been able to based on our early adoption."" Ross Gerber, the CEO of investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki, was blunt in his assessment: ""Management is garbage."" (Shortly after the call, The Information reported Snap's head of engineering is stepping down.) Even those who remain positive on the company suggest its leadership has been in some form of denial until now. ""We wouldn't be so quick to write off Snap just yet,"" James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi Hardt, wrote in an investor note Wednesday. ""We believe this is the first time the company is fully self-aware by acknowledging and appreciating the points of friction."""
"At an event in Goshen, New York on Wednesday, parent company Merlin Entertainments announced the Lego-inspired theme park will open in 2020. Merlin also operates Legoland parks in California, Florida and several international locations, including Japan and Dubai. The parent company also operates Madame Tussauds wax museums and U.K. theme park Alton Towers. A planning board for the town of Goshen, which is about 60 miles north of New York City, voted unanimously last week to move forward with the $500 million Lego theme park. The board granted a site plan, special use permit, and clearing and grading permit approval to Merlin for the project. The company plans to start construction ""soon,"" according to a spokesperson for Legoland. Legoland New York is expected to attract between 1.5 million and 2.5 million people every year. Related: Lego's new kit teaches kids to code But not all residents are welcoming the theme park with open arms. Groups like Stop Legoland and Concerned Citizens for the Hudson Valley oppose the project. Their concerns include an increase in local traffic, loss of active agricultural lands and environmental damage. Merlin has said the park will bring hundreds of ""high-quality"" jobs to the county. This will include entry-level park positions and hospitality roles. It also expects to generate $283 million in sales tax and hotel occupancy tax for Orange County, New York over 30 years. The review process for the project began in June 2016."
"This week, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services advised its officers to ""apply the same level of scrutiny"" to extension requests for the H-1B visa, among other sought after visas. In other words, officers are instructed to review requests for renewal as thoroughly as they would initial visa applications. The H-1B is a common visa pathway for high-skilled foreigners to work at companies in the U.S. It's valid for three years, and can be renewed for another three years. It's a program that's particularly near and dear to the tech community, with many talented engineers vying for one of the program's 85,000 visas each year. The directive rescinds the previous guidance, which gave ""deference"" to previously approved visas ""as long as the key elements were unchanged and there was no evidence of a material error or fraud related to the prior determination."" ""This updated guidance provides clear direction to help advance policies that protect the interests of U.S. workers,"" said new USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna, who was sworn in this month. President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate Cissna last spring. Related: Alphabet's Eric Schmidt says H-1B visa cap is 'stupid' In April, Trump directed federal agencies to implement a ""Buy American, Hire American"" strategy, which included proposing new rules and guidance for preventing fraud and abuse of work visas. The H-1B program, in particular, is one that President Trump has eyed for reform, criticizing abusers of the program who use the visa to replace American workers. Other visas impacted by the new guidance include L-1, for intracompany transfers, TN for Canadian and Mexican citizens, and O-1, for those with ""extraordinary abilities."" Some say the new policy will be unnecessarily burdensome and is aimed at limiting foreign workers. Betsy Lawrence, the director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told CNN Tech that the previous guidance made it efficient to review cases. Even then, USCIS had the authority to question prior decisions and request additional information in reviewing extensions. Related: Tech's beloved H-1B visa is flawed -- here's why ""[With the update], we are going to much greater scrutiny of these cases, and thus delays, even when the underlying facts have not changed,"" Lawrence told CNNMoney. Immigration attorney Chris Wright of The Wright Law Firm told CNNMoney that it fits a broader pattern: ""It seems clear that USCIS have been instructed to push back wherever they can..."" he said, noting that ""the prevailing attitude seems to be, 'How might we be able to deny this petition?'"""
"But tools from Google and Facebook sometimes struggle to appropriately insert themselves into conversations. For example, the smart reply feature in Google's Allo messaging app last week suggested I send the ""person wearing turban"" emoji in response to a message that included a gun emoji. My CNN Tech colleague was able to replicate the exchange in a separate chat. Google has fixed the response and issued an apology. ""We're deeply sorry that this suggestion appeared in Allo and have immediately taken steps to make sure nobody gets this suggested reply,"" the company said.  Smart replies are separate from the company's Google Assistant, its Siri and Alexa-like voice activated service. Instead, smart replies are real-time suggested responses based on the conversation you're having. It's unclear what provoked that suggested emoji response in Google's Allo, but there are a few issues that could be at play. Bots, smart replies, and virtual assistants know what humans teach them -- and because they're programmed by humans, they could contain biases. Google smart replies are trained and tested internally before they are widely rolled out to apps. Once on our phones, they learn responses based on the individual conversations taking place in the app. You tap on the suggested response to send it. I had never used the emoji before Allo suggested it. Learning algorithms aren't transparent, so it's hard to tell why exactly smart replies or virtual assistants make certain suggestions. ""When a reply is offensive, we'd like to explain where that came from, but typically can't,"" said Bertram Malle, co-director of the Humanity-Centered Robotics Initiative at Brown University. ""[The Allo exchange] may have occurred because of a built-in bias in its training database or its learning parameters, but it may be one of the many randomly distributed errors that present-day systems make."" Jonathan Zittrain, professor of law and computer science at Harvard University, said the issues around smart replies are reminiscent of offensive automated suggestions that have popped up while conducting Google (GOOG) searches over the years. There are preventative measures apps can take to avoid offensive responses in messaging, but there's no one-size-fits-all solution. ""[There are] red flag associations you specify up front and try to preempt,"" Zittrain said. ""But what counts as offensive and what doesn't will evolve and differs from one culture to another."" Related: Can tech be biased? Facebook has a virtual helper in its Messenger app, too: Facebook M. The feature runs in the background of the app and pops up to make suggestions, such as prompting you to order an Uber when it knows you're making plans. Suggested responses might be useful if you're in a hurry and on your phone -- for example, an automated response could offer to send ""See you soon."" But emoji and stickers and may complicate matters by trying to infer sentiment or human emotion. ""A lot of [complication] arises from asking machine learning to do its thing and advise us on not just on shortcuts to obvious answers but on emotions, emoji and more complicated sentiments,"" Zittrain said. Facebook (FB, Tech30) debuted its latest version of M in April, nearly two years after launched the feature as an experiment. Although it began as a ""personal digital assistant"" and was operated partially by humans, suggestions are now automated. It's available to Facebook Messenger users in a handful of countries. Google Smart replies and Facebook M are trained and tested internally before they are widely rolled out to messaging apps. Once on our phones, they learn responses based on the conversations taking place in the app. You tap on the suggested response to send it. I've been using Facebook M for months, and it often recommends responses that don't fit. In one instance, my friend and I were discussing a fiction book that involved exsanguinated corpses. M suggested we make dinner plans. It also missed the mark on more sensitive conversations. M suggested a vomit sticker following a description of a health issue affecting millions of women each year. A spokesperson for Facebook said the company is planning to roll out a new way in the coming weeks for people to explicitly say whether M's suggested response was helpful if they dismiss or ignore a suggestion. Companies have struggled with artificial intelligence in chat before. Apple's predictive autocomplete feature previously suggested only male emoji for executive roles including CEO, COO, and CTO. Microsoft's first attempt at a social media AI bot named Tay failed when the bot started to learn racist and offensive language taught by the public. The company tried a second time with a bot named Zo, and the company said it implemented safeguards to prevent bad behavior. However, that bot picked up bad habits, too. Google works to combat bias in machine learning training by looking at data more inclusively, through characteristics including gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity. But as with any big data set, errors can get through to the public. Flaws in these messaging apps show AI assistant technology is still relatively nascent. If not properly programmed and executed, automated chat services like bots and assistants will be ignored by users. ""It's already very hard to build trust between machines and humans,"" said Lu Wang, an assistant professor at the College of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern University. ""A lot of people are skeptical about what they can do and how well they can serve society. Once you lose that trust, it gets even harder."""
"It's also making it easier for local governments to have a say in whether deliveries should even be allowed. The White House announced Wednesday it's launching a three-year pilot program to create ""innovation zones"" for test drones around the country. The move aims to spur the development of the drone industry in the United States. Many drone companies have moved their operations overseas amid complaints that U.S. regulators are too slow to allow the new technology. In the pilot program, state, local and governments will partner with drone companies to evaluate operating at night, taking flights over people, and flying outside a pilot's line of sight. Package delivery is a possible service under consideration. The U.S. Department of Transportation will field applications for the program and grant at least five partnerships. This means, in theory, Google and the city of Detroit could be inspired to team up to offer burrito deliveries. The program is a step toward resolving who is in charge of what drones do. The federal government has long governed the skies rather than state and local leaders. The approach works as planes fly thousands of feet above the ground, so they have little impact on matters below. But small drones complicate things -- they can fly directly above homes, sidewalks, and public events. Many state and local governments have pushed for a say in how drones are regulated. Related: Parrot's new drones could save lives (and crops) ""This is a clear recognition that drones are different than manned aircraft and the regulatory structure needs to reflect that,"" Gregory McNeal, a co-founder of the drone startup AirMap and law professor at Pepperdine University, told CNN Tech. If cities and states have no say in when and where drones fly, troubling situations could result. For example, a fire department responding to a blaze may not be able to launch a drone because another one is delivering a package nearby. Some cities are also concerned they won't be able to restrict drone flights at certain times, such as during parades, fireworks displays, sporting events and public gatherings. To address these concerns, pilot tests will include restrictions surrounding when and how drones are flown. The program will help the federal government better understand how local governments can be involved. In a classic script, drone technology has developed faster than related regulations, forcing governments to play catch up. DJI, the world's drone maker, announced a new technology Wednesday that could make it easier for law enforcement to ensure drones are being used safely. DJI's AeroScope system creates a virtual license plate for drones. Law enforcement can use a suitcase-sized device to monitor all DJI drones within five kilometers, and know who is flying it, where it's flying and its purpose. Perhaps a police officer on your block will one day know if that drone headed toward your backyard just wants to drop off a chicken burrito."
"An assembly line worker says others mocked his pants as ""gay tight."" An engineer says she was taunted and catcalled on the factory floor, and was fired from the company after she sued for gender discrimination, including unequal pay. Four lawsuits filed in recent months describe a toxic culture at the plant in Fremont, California, where Tesla manufactures its electric cars and where about 10,000 people work. The suits also make Tesla the latest Silicon Valley company to come under scrutiny after workers alleged discrimination. The best-known example is Uber, where complaints of sexual harassment ultimately forced out the CEO. In statements, Tesla told CNN Tech that it takes all complaints seriously. But it said that, ""in the history of Tesla, there has never been a single proven case of discrimination against the company. Not one."" The workers are suing for mistreatment on Tesla's factory premises, alleging inaction by the company and, in some cases, the third-party staffing companies it contracts with. Those companies are also named in the suits. Related: Readers react to 'Money, Power, and Sexual Harassment' The plaintiffs, in some cases, say they were retaliated against after they came forward. At least four workers claim they were discriminated against at the factory because of race. DeWitt Lambert, a former electrician, alleges that coworkers called him the N-word and flashed gang signs at him, and that one worker threatened to ""cut Mr. Lambert up into pieces and send his body parts to his family members."" Tesla, in response, says Lambert frequently socialized with the men he's accusing, that other employees say Lambert used ""the same racially insensitive language that he had complained about,"" and that his complaint to the company about them was an ""attempt to turn the tables"" because he thought they had reported him first. The company said it fired several employees after investigating, adding ""...it's also clear that DeWitt's version of events is not supported by the facts."" ""There was no objective evidence that anything inappropriate occurred"" toward Lambert, the company says in a statement, noting that he was transferred to another work area after complaining to HR about the employees. Tesla said it has suspended Lambert with pay while it continues to investigate the situation. When asked for comment, Lambert's lawyers -- Lawrence A. Organ and Navruz Avloni of the California Civil Rights Law Group -- questioned Tesla's response. ""Tesla has admitted to the press that Mr. Lambert's harassers were disciplined. If this wasn't harassment, why did it discipline his harassers?"" In another lawsuit filed last week, three people who worked for a Tesla contractor allege that coworkers called them racial epithets. That suit was filed by Demetric Diaz, a production associate, and two elevator operators, Lamar Patterson and Owen Diaz. Tesla said it only learned about the complaints in that suit through media reports, and that the three men never raised a complaint within the company. According to the suit, the plaintiffs did report the problem to Tesla and, in some cases, the third-party staffing companies who employed them and put them to work inside Tesla. Organ and Avloni -- the lawyers representing Lambert in his suit, as well as the other three men alleging racial discrimination in their separate lawsuit -- say they've received an outpouring of calls from current and former employees about discrimination at the factory since Lambert filed the suit in March. Related: Another billion-dollar startup upended by sexual harassment ""At some point, we were receiving dozens of calls per day,"" Avloni, a managing attorney at the ?California Civil Rights Law Group, told CNN Tech. ""Most of the calls from Tesla employees are related to race harassment issues, which is reflective of how serious this problem is at the company."" The complaints against Tesla go beyond race. AJ Vandermeyden, an engineer at the factory, sued the company in the fall of 2016 for gender discrimination while she still worked there. She alleged that male engineers were paid higher salaries and promoted ahead of women who were equally or more qualified. In addition, she said, she endured ""inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls"" on the factory floor, she said. Vandermeyden was fired in May, she claims in retaliation for her lawsuit. Her case is in arbitration, according to her lawyer. The company goes on to say that after hiring an outside investigator, it became ""absolutely convinced that Ms. Vandermeyden's claims were illegitimate,"" and had no choice but to fire her. In fact, Tesla claims that Vandermeyden ""was given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications."" Related: Bill seeks to curb tech's sexual harassment problem In another lawsuit, Jorge Ferro, an assembly line production worker, alleges that a supervisor repeatedly harped on his sexuality, telling him that everyone suspected he was gay, and commenting that his pants were ""too tight -- gay tight."" He was threatened with taunts to watch his back, according to a lawsuit filed in May and revealed by The Guardian this week. After reporting the harassment to a superior, he claims, he was fired because of an ""injury"" -- which Ferro said was a scar he'd had for 16 years. He's suing to get his job reinstated, as well as for damages. The case is in private mediation. A Tesla spokesperson said that while Ferro and the supervisor are employed by a third party, ""Tesla still stepped in to try to keep these individuals apart from one another and to ensure a good working environment."" In its statement, as with the other statements provided for this article, the spokesperson alluded to the misuse of its name in lawsuits to garner media attention. ""... it maximizes the chances of generating publicity for their case,"" the company said in a statement. ""They abuse our name, because they know it is catnip for journalists. Tesla takes any and every form of discrimination or harassment extremely seriously. There is no company on Earth with a better track record than Tesla."""

"She was one of Twitter's first employees. Somewhere around number 50. Over five years at the company, she got the Pope to join Twitter, live-tweeted the birth of her daughter, and wrote at length on how organizations can use Twitter to spark positive social change. She wrote a book called ""Twitter For Good."" But Diaz-Ortiz says she finds it harder to defend the social network these days. She attributes it to President Trump and his use of Twitter as a ""bully pulpit,"" from which he may hurl shocking insults at critics and threaten nuclear war. ""Everything about the last year has made me stop and think about that [book] title, and how it would be received now,"" Diaz-Ortiz said. ""In 2017, those of us embedded in the world of social feel the need to defend the medium. Meanwhile, a small blue bird is chattering away on our shoulders, asking, 'Is this Twitter for bad?'"" It's not simply the role social media has played in providing a platform for Trump, a president many leaders in the industry openly oppose. In the year since the election, there's been a steady drumbeat of damaging headlines about fake news, polarizing filter bubbles and Russian propaganda campaigns across social media. Related: Russian meddling on Facebook: What we learned this week The latest innovation in Silicon Valley may be doubt. After years of maintaining an unwavering optimism about technology, some who've worked at Twitter, Facebook and Google have spent much of 2017 reckoning with the unintended consequences of the products they built. It reached a fever pitch last week as executives from the three tech companies were grilled by Congress over Russian meddling in the 2016 election. As Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from the companies' home state of California, put it in one hearing: ""You've created these platforms, and now they are being misused. And you have to be the ones to do something about it, or we will."" Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and influential venture capitalist, says it's been ""gut-wrenching"" for tech employees to see tools intended to connect people instead be abused by bad actors to tear at the very fabric of American society. ""Do I feel guilty? Absolutely I feel guilt,"" Palihapitiya told CNN. The tech industry fails to predict the future For Silicon Valley, part of the sting comes from being blindsided. Suddenly, an industry that prides itself on predicting the future has been forced to admit its failure to foresee the darker side of its products. The same social media tools that helped propel the candidacy of the first African American president, who the industry widely supported, could also help the campaign of a populist celebrity real estate developer. The same algorithms that surfaced the most relevant content for users could create seemingly impenetrable ideological echo chambers. And the same advanced ad targeting tools powering dominant billion-dollar businesses could be weaponized to sow discord among voters. Wesley Chan, an early product manager at Google who left the company in 2014, says he was always more concerned about people abusing Google for economic reasons, not ""political sabotage"" from foreign actors. ""This political stuff never crossed my mind once,"" he says. ""You only deal with things when you get burned. It's a terrible lesson to learn."" Related: 'Kill them all' - Russian-linked Facebook accounts called for violence Palihapitiya says the sense of shock is evident among tech leaders. ""Nobody ever thought that you could have such a massive manipulation of the system,"" he says. ""You can see the reaction of the people who run these companies. They never thought it was possible."" In the first days after the election, Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark Zuckerberg dismissed as ""crazy"" the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the election. Nearly a year later, he walked back the comment. And in a remarkably candid post for Yom Kippur, he apologized for ""the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together."" ""I think Facebook's techno-utopianism blinded itself,"" says Antonio Garcia Martinez, a former product manager at Facebook who helped develop its ad targeting system. ""Everyone thought Facebook was always a force for good."" The same can be said of Twitter. For years, Twitter saw itself as a haven for free expression. A popular slogan internally described Twitter as ""the free speech wing of the free speech party."" Employees were particularly proud their service helped fuel the pro-democracy protests that swept across the Middle East in 2011, dubbed the Arab Spring. ""That fact has at times prevented the product from progressing for fear of upsetting or impeding the next Arab Spring,"" says Nathan Hubbard, a former VP at Twitter who left in mid-2016. ""Of course, it's the same features that gave rise to the Arab Spring that gave rise to the fringes of Trumpism,"" he adds, referring to the activity of white supremacists. ""It's just that the good came before the 'bad' organized."" The American awakening Yet, the potential for the internet to corrode civil society was apparent years ago in some of the same Middle East countries where the Arab Spring movements previously took root. Wael Ghonim, an Egyptian activist who became a leading voice in the Arab Spring, began noticing the polarizing impact of social media on politics in Egypt as far back as 2013. Ghonim, a former Google executive, raised his concerns in public speeches, but found it ""wasn't hitting home"" in the tech community. Related: Twitter: Employee briefly shut down Trump's account on last day of work ""No one is incentivized to believe that their work has negative contributions to society,"" Ghonim said. The industry's thinking, he added, was that ""it could be attributed to so many things,"" and may be ""just something that has to do with Egypt."" It's only this past year, with social media being accused of warping political discourse in Silicon Valley's backyard, that the industry is taking these concerns more seriously. Facebook, Twitter and Google have each worked to crack down on fake news and continue investigating Russia's activity. Twitter is finally issuing new rules to curb harassment. Facebook has taken its first modest steps to ease the filter bubble and pledged during the hearings to double the number of people working on safety and security issues to 20,000 next year (which would still average out to just one safety worker for every 100,000-plus Facebook users). ""We are moving from the age of denial into the age of realization,"" Ghonim says, ""but it's not full realization yet."" Case in point: One early Facebook employee agreed that fake news, filter bubbles and disinformation campaigns are ""very real problems,"" but stressed that ""these issues ... are as old as the concept of media itself."" ""It is completely misunderstanding the nature and threat of 'fake news' to suggest that Facebook and the people behind it, past and present, bear any personal responsibility for what happened in last year's election,"" the former employee said, ""and the general state of political discourse in America today."""
"He launched an investigation into alleged Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property earlier this year. But some experts say a bigger concern is Beijing's huge bets on the technologies of the future. The Chinese government is throwing its weight behind sectors like artificial intelligence, electric cars and computer chips, pumping in money to create tech champions with global clout. Related: China wants to build a $150 billion AI industry Western companies have already raised concerns about the plans, warning they may give Chinese companies an unfair edge at home and abroad. Some analysts have called for the U.S. to ramp up spending on technology research in order to keep pace. As Trump prepares to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, here's a look at some of the key areas where China is giving the U.S. a run for its money. Artificial intelligence Russian President Vladimir Putin recently predicted that whoever becomes the the leader in artificial intelligence ""will become the ruler of the world."" China wants to be that leader. It laid out its plan this summer to become an artificial intelligence superpower by 2030. Related: Elon Musk says AI may cause World War III The country's AI industry has ""government support that most other countries don't really have,"" said John Choi, an analyst who covers Chinese internet companies for Daiwa Capital Markets. ""The level of funding is not even comparable to most other nations."" The Chinese government's 2030 plan aims to build a domestic AI industry worth nearly $150 billion. ""China leads in the area for the simple reason -- it's a government push,"" said Chwee Kan Chua, global research lead for artificial intelligence with research firm IDC.  China is pouring resources into intelligent video. The sector is developing ""smart"" cameras that can detect unusual patterns and flag them to officials or law enforcement. It shows how China's ruling Communist Party can brush aside privacy issues in order to gather tons of footage to fuel AI research. In the name of public safety, the Chinese government ""will have cameras everywhere in every single corner that can track movements, objects and people so it can build huge database analytics to train artificial intelligence,"" Chua said. The push isn't just coming from the public sector. Like their U.S. rivals, Chinese tech giants Alibaba (BABA, Tech30), Baidu (BIDU, Tech30) and Tencent (TCEHY) are investing heavily in AI and setting up research centers in the U.S. Related: These three countries are winning the global robot race Electric cars There's a reason why Tesla (TSLA) is eager to have a manufacturing plant in China. The country has the world's largest market for electric vehicles, thanks to years of generous tax credits and government subsidies. China's efforts are yielding results for its homegrown industry. Domestic companies are among the leading makers of electric vehicles in the world, and Chinese consumers are increasingly interested in buying them. Related: China wants to ban gas and diesel cars Beijing is doubling down on the industry. The country's ""Made in China 2025"" plan calls for domestically produced hybrid vehicles and electric cars to account for at least 70% of total sales by 2025. Major global automakers like Volkswagen (VLKAF) and Ford (F) have recently announced plans to develop electric cars in China with local partners, bringing their technological know-how into the country.  The government is also building a nationwide network of public charging stations. The number of outlets stood at 150,000 at the end of last year and authorities aim to add another 100,000 this year, according to state media. In the U.S., meanwhile, the tax reform bill wending its way through Congress would kill a federal tax credit of as much as $7,500 for Americans who buy an electric car. Computer chips China is far and away the biggest buyer of semiconductors, the computer chips used in everything from iPhones to automobiles. It consumed nearly 60% of the $354 billion global semiconductor market in 2015, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. But the U.S. has the largest semiconductor industry, with U.S.-based companies accounting for about half of the global market, according to research from the Semiconductor Industry Association. If Beijing has its way, that will soon change. Related: Trump stops China-backed takeover of U.S. chip maker The Chinese government has set out ambitious targets, pledging billions of dollars to help develop a globally competitive semiconductor industry. After it twice tried to invest in U.S. semiconductor companies -- and was twice blocked -- state-backed company Tsinghua Unigroup secured $22 billion from Chinese government investors to help it build China's first advanced memory chip factories. The U.S. Department of Commerce has flagged China's ambitions as ""a real long-term threat to not only U.S. firms but the entire global semiconductor ecosystem."""
"The company announced on Tuesday it is doubling how many characters users can cram into a tweet. Most tweets will now fit 280 characters, up from 140. The new limit will roll out to Twitter users in almost all 40 languages Twitter supports. In late September, Twitter began a test of 280-character tweets with a small group of users. Like many Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) changes, some users complained about the move. Interestingly, Twitter said that after the novelty of tweeting more characters wore off, most people in the test stopped tweeting the full length. According to the company, only 5% of tweets sent from people in the 280-character test group were longer than 140 characters, and just 2% were over 190 characters. Related: Following backlash, Twitter clarifies what violates its policies The new character length won't apply to Japanese, Korean or Chinese-language tweets. Those languages can convey twice as much information in less space, so tweets will remain at 140 characters, Twitter said. Of course, the change means America's highest-profile Twitter user, President Trump, will have more space. Twitter cofounder Biz Stone had said the prolific Twitter user was not in the test group. The move modifies a fundamental aspect of Twitter. Aside from the test, the social network's character limit hasn't changed since the company launched in 2006. The 140-character length wasn't a random choice: Twitter's founders wanted tweets to fit in a text message, which can only hold 160 characters. So Twitter chose 140 characters for the tweet, and 20 characters for the user name. During the 280-character test, some users argued Twitter should focus less on the length of the tweets and more on the content. The platform continues to be rife with harassment and abuse, despite the company's efforts to better police it. Twitter recently updated its rules to be more explicit in its definitions and policies towards harassment, threats, and adult content. Everyone affected by the new length should have it by Tuesday evening."
"Snap (SNAP), the parent company of Snapchat, said Tuesday that it is planning to redesign the messaging application to make it easier to use after facing several consecutive quarters of anemic user growth. ""One thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback,"" Evan Spiegel, Snap's CEO, said in prepared remarks for an earnings call Tuesday. Spiegel added that the redesign could be ""disruptive"" to Snap's business in the short term. ""We don't yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application,"" he said. No timetable was provided for the redesign. The goal is to make it easier to discover content on the social network and also to create more opportunities for content creators to make money. Related: Snapchat adds features as rivalry with Instagram intensifies Snap's decision to overhaul its core product is particularly startling as it comes barely eight months after Snap went public. Snap has struggled for much of its life as a public company, falling below its IPO price in July. ""There has been a ton of change in a very short period of time,"" Spiegel admitted on the call. ""That's been the case over the life of the business... We're not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business."" The announcement followed yet another disappointing quarter for the company. Snapchat added just 4.5 million new daily active users in the third quarter, bringing its total audience to 178 million daily users. Instagram Stories, a Snapchat knockoff product, recently hit 300 million daily users. The company's losses more than tripled from the previous year to $443 million in the third quarter, while its sales fell well short of Wall Street estimates. Even Snap's first foray into hardware appears to be a failure. The company took a nearly $40 million writedown for excess inventory of Spectacles, its smart glasses. ""Unfortunately, we misjudged strong early demand for Spectacles and purchased more inventory than we now anticipate being able to sell,"" Drew Vollero, Snap's CFO, said on the call. Snap stock plunged as much as 20% in after hours trading Tuesday following the earnings report."
"The account, which has more than 41 million followers, was restored after just 11 minutes, and Twitter says it's conducting an internal review. But the company's statements have raised more questions than they've answered: How did this happen? And could it again? Here are three key questions Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) has yet to answer: How could this happen? The fact that one worker was able to take down the president's account left people asking whether Twitter has appropriate internal controls. The early consensus seems to be ""no."" ""This is a case of human negligence and lack of process in place,"" said Subramanian Udaiyappan, a Bangalore-based cybersecurity specialist at Cisco. ""Twitter needs to ensure that only the right people have access to such actions and these have to go through process permissions, approvals and logging before any action is taken by an employee."" Related: Twitter employee briefly shut down Trump's account on last day of work People are also puzzled over how Twitter detected the issue so quickly. ""Eleven minutes? Does that mean he checks his Twitter account every 60 seconds?!? How did they get it back up so fast and HOW could this happen?"" asked a Twitter user named Luke Tucker. Who did it? Twitter didn't name the staffer who deactivated Trump's account, but it did describe the person as a ""customer support employee."" One big question: How many employees at Twitter have the same power? Employees that review accounts for abuse typically have the power to suspend users, according to a former consultant for Twitter who asked not to be identified. The consultant said that many of these employees tend to be relatively junior ¡ª a common practice across social media firms. The situation ""raises bigger questions on privacy as to what level of information access does a normal Twitter employee get,"" Udaiyappan said. Related: Twitter accidentally suspends its own CEO's account Has it happened before? High-profile accounts have gone offline before, causing confusion and uproar. Twitter temporarily suspended the account of actress Rose McGowan in October after she tweeted about sexual harassment allegations made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The move caused a huge backlash, and Twitter later reversed it. The company said it suspended McGowan's account because the actress had tweeted a private phone number, a violation of its terms of service. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey would later announce new rules over ""unwanted sexual advances, non-consensual nudity, hate symbols, violent groups, and tweets that glorifies violence."" Dorsey has had his own problems using Twitter. His account was abruptly suspended last year in what he later described as an ""internal mistake."" My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.  Trump addressed his account's suspension in a tweet early Friday. ""My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee,"" he wrote. ""I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact."" -- Samuel Burke contributed to this report."
"Hundreds of new emoji -- such as gender neutral options, a woman in a headscarf and more food items -- are available starting Tuesday with the iOS 11.1 update on iPhone and iPad. Earlier this month, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) previewed more than two dozen of the new emoji, including more expressive smiley faces, mythical creatures and clothing. The emoji announced on World Emoji Day earlier this year, such as a breastfeeding mom, will also be included in this update.

Google's version of the burger emoji on Android shows the cheese under the burger and above the bun. Over the weekend, a debate went viral over the proper placement of toppings on a patty. Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, even weighed in on Twitter, saying he would ""drop everything"" to address the discussion, clarifying ""if folks can agree on the correct way to do this!"" No action has been taken so far. Android also recently redesigned its emoji after criticism that they looked like blobs. It added new options like an orange heart, T-Rex and vomiting face."
"Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) thinks so. The company says it has a safe way for you to allow delivery drivers inside your home, even when you're not there. The service is called Amazon Key and launches November 8 for Prime members. You buy a kit that includes an Amazon security camera, the Cloud Cam, and a compatible smart lock. The kit starts at $249.99. You order something for delivery and click the ""in-home"" shipping option. When the delivery driver arrives, Amazon verifies the address and delivery time and allows him or her into your home. You can watch from your phone as the camera records the whole thing. Related: Cool or creepy? Walmart to deliver food and put it in fridge Amazon says the delivery driver will not be given an access code or key. The service isn't just for deliveries.

Amazon Key will be available in 37 U.S. cities to start, and Amazon says it will add more. It's not the first major retailer to experiment with remote delivery access. Last month, Walmart (WMT) announced that it was testing a service that allows a delivery driver from the startup Deliv into your home, mostly for groceries. It will even give the delivery person access to your refrigerator. In the Walmart service, the driver gets a one-time passcode for a smart lock, and you can watch the delivery on security cameras."
"A new drone from Parrot has the potential to help. Outfitted with a thermal camera, the Bebop Pro Thermal can fly over devastated areas and feed a live image back to an app, providing up-to-date status information and identifying hot spots -- including the heat given off by a survivor's body. Parrot announced a pair of new mid-range professional drones on Tuesday. The two devices have very specific jobs and are meant to fill in a need between consumer drones and pricy commercial offerings. The $1,500 Parrot Bebop-Pro Thermal is for construction, inspection, and public safety workers. In addition to search and rescue, its two cameras can be used to see where heat is escaping from a roof, or what areas are still too hot after a fire. The company is also releasing a drone for farmers with mid-sized crops. Small enough to fit in a carry-on suitcase, the $5,000 Bluegrass drone uses a front-facing camera and built-in sensor for precision agriculture. It can fly for 25 minutes on one charge, covering 30 hectares of land. The drone feeds footage back to a companion app and can tell a farmer if a crop is healthy. It can even be used to keep an eye on livestock. Parrot (PAOTF) is a 23-year-old French technology company that has shifted almost entirely to drones in recent years. It's also investing heavily in innovation -- of it's 700 employees, more than half are working in research and development, according to the company. It is mostly well known for its consumer drones ¡ª fun and affordable quadcopters that can be used to shoot video and take photos. It also makes commercial drones including fixed wing unmanned aircraft. Those devices typically cost more than $10,000 and are used by large companies, like industrial farms. Now the company is trying to appeal to commercial operations that aren't big enough to justify dropping that much money on larger, more elaborate devices. The new line is priced at $5,000 and under, and is meant to be as easy to use as consumer drones while including powerful cameras and software like the professional options. That price point could be especially useful for public safety agencies, which don't have as much budget as large corporations. The idea of using drones in public safety is not new. Parrot has been working closely with public safety workers in France to find out the best ways a drone can help during an emergency. In 2016, parts of Paris experienced extreme flooding. Parrot worked with the local Fire and Emergency Department to send drones out to monitor water levels and help gather information that was later used to decide on an evacuation. Now the company is hoping a drone built just for those kinds of tasks can take off, and maybe even save lives."
"The concept may seem playful, but industrial designer Berk Ilhan invented the Smile Mirror to uplift the spirits of cancer patients. The plug-in device looks like a tablet with a built-in camera and an opaque surface made with a smart material triggered by proprietary software. It includes facial recognition technology that captures the face. The surface becomes reflective, like an traditional mirror, when it recognizes a smile. Just like a conventional mirror, it can hang on the wall or sit on a table. Ilhan, originally from Turkey, spent two years designing and developing the product. Related: 23andMe wants to develop drugs based on your DNA While attending the School of Visual Arts in New York for a master's degree, he conceptualized a portfolio of products aimed at improving the quality of life of cancer patients on an emotional and social level. He spent a few weeks at various cancer hospitals in Turkey speaking with patients, oncologists and caregivers. ""I learned morale and social support are two very important factors that can positively change a patient's experience,"" Ilhan told CNN Tech. He honed in on laughter, calling it a ""powerful tool."" Research indicates smiling and laughter can decrease stress and boost the body's immune system. The Smile Mirror was inspired by Ilhan's conversation with a cancer survivor. ""She told me in the first days after her diagnosis, it was difficult for her to look in the mirror and acknowledge she had cancer,"" he said. ""Our facial expressions affect how we feel. If we flex our facial muscles to smile, our brains think that something good happened and as a result, [we feel] happiness."" Related: Amid opioid crisis, some patients turn to tech alternatives Ilhan is currently producing the Smile Mirror in limited quantities. The price, however, is expensive. As of now, it costs between $2,000 to $3,000. But the product will soon launch on crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, where Ilhan hopes to raise enough funds to produce it in larger quantities and bring down the price to under $500. Ilhan's goal is to donate Smile Mirrors to hospitals. He intends for it to appeal to larger audiences. ""Anyone can buy one,"" he said. ""If you give it to someone, you are gifting them a smile."""
"That's one of the company's eight new ""cultural norms,"" which CEO Dara Khosrowshahi unveiled publicly on Tuesday following an internal all-hands meeting. The CEO was charged with reformulating Uber's controversial company values after a months-long investigation into Uber's culture following sexual harassment allegations in February. Gone is the ""win at all costs"" mindset. In are the notions of persevering and valuing ideas over hierarchy. When Khosrowshahi took the company's helm in August, Uber's problematic values included Always Be Hustlin', Meritocracy, Superpumped and Toe-stepping. ""...'toe-stepping' was meant to encourage employees to share their ideas regardless of their seniority or position in the company, but too often it was used an excuse for being an asshole,"" said Khosrowshahi in a post. Related: Uber pledges $5 million to sexual assault prevention The eight new norms are purposefully not referred to as values. Khosrowshahi says that's because ""we fully expect them to evolve as Uber continues to grow."" Notably, there's no more mention of a meritocracy, a Silicon Valley aspiration that the best and brightest rise up based purely on their skills. Instead, Uber now says: ""We celebrate differences."" ""We ensure people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome. We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build."" Khosrowshahi said the new list was created with the help of employees. More than 1,200 staffers sent in submissions, and 22,000 votes were cast, Khosrowshahi wrote in his post. The company also said it held more than 20 focus groups with representatives from employee resource groups and Uber's international offices. Here's the full list of the company's new norms: We build globally, we live locally; We are customer obsessed; We celebrate differences; We do the right thing; We act like owners; We persevere; We value ideas over hierarchy; We make big bold bets."
"But a history of controversial legislation could hold some of them back. Amazon says 238 cities and regions across North America put in bids to become its second headquarters, the company's largest expansion outside Seattle. The winner gets tens of thousands of jobs and a lift for the local economy. Texas and Georgia are among the competition's heavy hitters. Several cities in each state were part of bids for HQ2, and Austin and Atlanta have been floated as top contenders by analytics firms and gambling sites. One potential snag: Both states recently tangled with bills that met fierce opposition from major corporations, including Amazon in one case. State officials in Texas this year considered a ""bathroom bill"" that would have required people to use school restrooms that match the sex on their birth certificates. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) was among dozens of companies that knocked the bill for discriminating against transgender people. One of the company's top executives, Jeff Wilke, signed onto a letter in May that called such laws ""bad for our employees and bad for business."" The company has supported protections for LGBT people. Last year, Amazon joined a coalition of other businesses backing a federal anti-discrimination bill. And at a dinner last month, the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights organization, gave Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos its National Equality Award. ""Across the United States, more people now support gay and trans rights than ever before,"" Bezos said. ""I believe that the idea of equality is ingrained deeply within all of us. It is inalienable."" Amazon did not respond to a request comment for this story. The Texas bill was eventually defeated. But some experts say it could have lingering effects. ""Even failed legislation is costly for a state's reputation and image,"" said Mark Jones, the political science fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""Efforts like the 'bathroom bill' in Texas would make it difficult for Amazon to attract the best and the brightest in the Lone Star State."" That's the fear for Byron Cook, a Republican state representative in Texas who opposed the bill. In an op-ed for the Austin American-Statesman in September, Cook suggested Amazon wouldn't take the state seriously until the governor shut down any chance that the bill might return. ""We heard universally from industries that they are opposed to discriminatory legislation, particularly when it solves no problems,"" Cook told CNNMoney. ""I don't think this company is going to take a risk with something being polarized."" Cook's concerns aren't unique. In Georgia, Governor Nathan Deal, a Republican, vetoed a ""religious liberty"" bill last year that would have given religious organizations in Georgia the option to deny services and jobs to LGBT people. It was roundly criticized by companies like Disney, Salesforce and Coca-Cola, which considered it discriminatory. But Deal leaves office after next year. And some of his potential replacements have reportedly said they would support similar legislation. That led a top aide for Deal to warn that any future efforts to pass similar bills could hurt the state's chances with Amazon, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The aide, Chris Riley, declined to comment to CNNMoney. Some of the cities that have bid for the Amazon site, like Austin and Dallas, have their own ordinances that prohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity. But Jones, the public policy fellow, said even those measures might not be enough to assuage concerns. He pointed to the city's recent spat with Uber and Lyft, the ride-hailing companies. After city residents voted last year to require such companies to fingerprint drivers, the two services pulled out of Austin. Austin moved on -- at least until state lawmakers overturned the local regulation. ""Austin is an island, but it's an island surrounded by the sea of Texas,"" Jones said. ""Austin can only do so much to buttress or hold back statewide policies."""
"Navya, a French technology company, unveiled a self-driving sedan Tuesday, and it doesn't have the usual feature of a driver's seat. Production of the six-passenger electric vehicle will begin in early 2018, accelerating the arrival of autonomous vehicles onto streets around the world. Navya already makes a driverless shuttle, which is similar to a small bus and generally travels at the pace of a good jogger, making it ill-suited for most driving conditions. There are 50 of the shuttles in operation, according to Navya. The new sedan, called the Autonom Cab, is capable of speeds up to 55 mph. It will sell for 250,000 euros and is designed to be used in a ride-sharing service rather than sold to an individual. ""We're in the race for the robotaxi,"" Navya?CEO Christophe Sapet told CNN Tech. ""It was disappointing to be seen as just as shuttle maker."" Related: The case for rushing self-driving cars onto streets Experts forecast that the autonomous vehicle industry will be worth trillions. This has fueled an intense race, and $80 billion has been invested in autonomous vehicle research, according to a Brookings Institute report released this fall. Navya will be demonstrating the Autonom Cab at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this January. In April, it will begin testing the vehicle in France and the United States. Navya is hoping to test six vehicles in five different cities, according to Sapet. The Autonom Cab will still have to prove that it can drive safely on roads. They haven't announced a target date for broadly reaching consumers after the tests in April. It won't have a steering wheel or pedals, but a Navya employee will ride in the vehicle and be able to control it with a joystick. Navya is far from the only competitor looking to perfect the right vehicle for giving self-driving rides. Waymo, the self-driving company from Google's parent company, has transitioned from two-seat vehicles to roomier Chrysler Pacificas minivans. Cruise Automation, the self-driving arm of General Motors, uses its Chevy Bolt, an electric five-seat vehicle it has described as perfect for ride-sharing. Uber has tried Ford sedans and now a Volvo SUV. Experts forecast that autonomous vehicles will help save many of the 1.25 million lives lost each year in motor vehicle crashes. Navya was far from the only autonomous vehicle company making news this week. Waymo announced Tuesday that it is now testing vehicles with a test driver in the driver's seat."
"The ridesharing company announced the effort on Monday on the heels of sexual harassment and assault reports hitting Hollywood, media and the tech industry. The funds, which will be distributed over the course of five years, will go to various groups, including Raliance, the National Network to End Domestic Violence and NO MORE. In 2016, the National Football League donated $10 million to Raliance amid domestic abuse scandals impacting its industry. The organizations have been in talks with Uber since June, the company said. Uber's team of 150 customer service agents have taken new trainings for handling calls related to harassment issues. Tracey Breeden, head of global safety communications at Uber, told CNN Tech the ability to respond with empathy to calls from drivers or riders that pertain to issues as sensitive as sexual violence is ""critically important."" Uber has also created a new specialized team to handle ""more severe"" incidents reported by drivers or riders. Meanwhile, Uber's executive leadership team participated in trainings last week facilitated by the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence and the National Network to End Domestic Violence, Breeden said. Related: What we know (and don't know) about Uber background checks Raliance spokeswoman Kristen Houser said it's a rare move for big firms to recognize sexual violence prevention.

"But as a queer black woman, she found the industry wasn't in her favor. ""I tried earnestly and with wide eyes,"" Hamilton told CNN Tech. ""But I just got doors slammed in my face. Nobody was interested."" Hamilton, then 34, also struggled to afford a place to live. Even as she tried to set up meetings with potential partners, she spent nights on the floor of the San Francisco Airport. Later that year, her first investment came through. She started Backstage Capital, a firm dedicated to funding underrepresented founders who identify as LGBTQ, women and people of color. Since its launch in 2015, the company said it has invested over $2 million in more than 50 startups. This includes ShearShare, a platform that connects stylists to salons, and Astral AR, an augmented reality piloting system for drones. Its goal is to reach 100 founders by 2020. Starting her own fund meant facing a system that has not been fair to people of color, especially black women. According to a study by researchers from Babson and Wellesley colleges, female CEOs receive 3% of all VC funding. Meanwhile, black women founders made up only 0.2% of all VC deals between 2012 to 2014, according to #ProjectDiane. The study, which published last year, examined more than 60,000 startups in the U.S. ""I realized that [access to] opportunities were only for certain people. If anyone else wanted in, they'd have to create their own access and their own experience,"" Hamilton said. ""I said, 'I could not do this, but then I won't see any change. If they wont let me in, I'll start my own league.'"" Backstage Capital has since attracted support from Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield and Marc Andreessen, an investor in Twitter, Skype and Facebook. Related: Tech's diversity efforts are 'a failure' Starting her ""own league"" wasn't and still isn't easy. The few black women founders who receive VC funding get significantly less of the pie. The average amount of money for a failed startup raises $1.3 million, but the average black female founder received $36,000, the #ProjectDiane study showed. Part of the battle is explaining diversity can be good for business, said Hamilton. For example, companies with female founders saw 63% higher returns than companies with all men did, one study showed.

"Broadcom has made a $130 billion unsolicited bid to buy Qualcomm. If completed, it would tie up two seemingly complementary chipmaking behemoths. Qualcomm made its name inventing the 2G and 3G wireless network technology used by Verizon and Sprint. Now the bulk of its sales come from mobile chips powering the brains in smartphones and the radios that enable cellular communications. Broadcom primarily makes chips for wired broadband communications, including modems, Wi-Fi, switches and routers. The deal comes just as every wireless carrier in America is about to unleash its 5G technology. Unlike 4G, 3G and 2G before it, 5G will rely on wired and wireless technology working in tandem. Because of how 5G technology will be built, wireless carriers will have to deploy small radios -- essentially mini cell towers -- all around the covered area. Each of those towers will need an Ethernet connection. If Broadcom and Qualcomm combine, it could market itself as an end-to-end 5G technology provider. Qualcomm has endured a miserable 2017, mainly because of an epic standoff with Apple (AAPL, Tech30). Qualcomm claims Apple violated some its patents and is trying to block iPhone sales in China. Meanwhile, Apple is rumored to be building a future iPhone without Qualcomm components. Although Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30) briefly became the world's largest chipmaker, it was leapfrogged by Intel (INTC, Tech30) and then Samsung earlier this year. The company's stock has fallen 5% this year -- an opportune time for Broadcom to buy it. Monday's announcement comes days after President Trump revealed that Broadcom would move its legal headquarters back to the United States. It had previously incorporated in Singapore. Related: Broadcom moving legal headquarters back to U.S. That legal maneuver helps Broadcom (AVGO) avoid increased regulatory scrutiny levied on foreign companies that want to buy American corporations. Still, the deal could invite antitrust concerns. Both companies are big players in the high-end Wi-Fi market, notes Christopher Rolland, semiconductor analyst for Susquehanna. Another complication: Both companies are in the middle of buying other chipmakers. Qualcomm has agreed to buy NXP (NXPI), and Broadcom is buying Brocade (BRCD). The only larger deal in U.S. corporate history was AOL's $162 billion deal for CNN parent company Time Warner (TWX) in 1999. The Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would be tied with Verizon's $130 billion purchase of half Vodafone's Verizon Wireless stake in 2013, and Dow's $130 billion merger with DuPont in 2015."
"Son's company, SoftBank (SFTBF) -- which already has an 83% stake in Sprint -- said Monday that it will buy more of the stock but will keep its holding below the 85% threshold that would trigger a public offer for all the remaining shares. Son, who some analysts recently described as the Warren Buffett of tech, has been trying to bring Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) together for years. But the Oracle of Tokyo failed to make his vision a reality: merger talks were abandoned over the weekend. ""Sprint could well end up as an albatross around Softbank's neck,"" said Dan Baker, an analyst with research firm Morningstar. The risks include fierce competition in the U.S. wireless industry and Sprint's need for investment as carriers shift to 5G technology in the coming years, he added. Related: Sprint and T-Mobile abandon merger talks Son, who's often referred to as ""Masa,"" has made a name for himself as an ambitious tech investor. He put money into Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) early on and launched a massive tech fund, worth close to $100 billion, with Saudi Arabia this year. Some analysts were optimistic Son could pull off the Sprint-T-Mobile merger, which he had said was more likely to happen after President Trump took office. Research firm Bernstein, which likened Son to Buffett, said last month that Sprint and T-Mobile joining forces ""would eliminate a major headache and once again prove Masa's prowess in deal making."" Instead, Son spent the start of SoftBank's quarterly earnings presentation Monday explaining the failure to reach a deal. ""Even though in the short term, Sprint and SoftBank share prices might drop, I feel good about this decision,"" he said. SoftBank shares sank 2.6% in Tokyo on Monday, adding to losses last week when reports suggested the Sprint deal was in trouble. Related: Japanese tycoon wants to invest $880 billion in tech The SoftBank earnings report also showed Sprint is sucking in money. Investment in its network and other physical assets jumped a whopping 71% in the six months that ended in September compared with the same period a year earlier. Son insists that even without T-Mobile, Sprint fits into SoftBank's strategy. ""We are entering an era where billions of new connected devices and sensors will come online throughout the United States,"" he said in a statement. ""Continuing to own a world class mobile network is central to our vision of ubiquitous connectivity."""
"Instead, the body of the Lamborghini Terzo Millennio concept car, made from exotic carbon nanotubes, would be used as a supercapacitor. Supercapacitors store and release energy in a manner different from that employed by batteries. They have certain advantages, but also serious disadvantages. It could be years, if ever, before scientists from MIT and Lamborghini, which is part of the Volkswagen Group (VLKAF), can overcome the downsides. But the effort would be worth it, said Mauricio Reggiani, Lamborghini's head of research and development. ""At the moment, we are really optimistic,"" he said. Even the best batteries won't work in a supercar, Reggiani said, because they're too heavy and bulky. If the car used only small batteries, so as not to add too much mass, he said, they would get drained quickly and wouldn't provide peak performance for very long. ""If I have a super sports car and I want to go the [race track], I want to go one, two, three laps without having to stop and recharge after every lap,"" he said. Supercapacitors, which can be made from carbon, have the flexibility to be formed into body panels, which the car needs anyway, thereby limiting their impact on the car's weight and design. Supercapacitors also take in and release energy much more quickly than batteries which is helpful in a performance car. Batteries can get hot, and their performance can suffer, when high-powered electric motors, plus heavy-footed drivers, try to draw too much power from them too quickly. Supercapicitors have some major drawbacks, though. They aren't very good at storing large amounts of energy long term. Today, supercapacitors are usually used in roles that involve quick, short bursts of energy such as to quickly restart a gasoline engine. Making supercapacitors that are as good at holding energy as they are at doling it out is one of the biggest challenges the scientists are working on, said Reggiani. Each of the car's four wheels would be independently powered by an electric motor. This would give the car all-wheel-drive, a traditional feature of modern Lamborghinis, while also providing more design freedom, since a big electric motor wouldn't need to be housed in the body of the car. Another interesting function of the carbon nanotube body, according to Lamborghini, is that it can be made ""self-healing."" Sensors in the body could detect cracks that, provided they were tiny enough, could immediately be filled through small internal tubes. More serious damage would be reported to the driver and to Lamborghini technicians who could make needed repairs. Besides simply making all of this technology work, the challenge will be making it feasible for a production car, even at Lamborghini prices, Reggiani said. Automakers of all types are being pressed to reduce emissions and offering all-electric cars would be one way to do that. In the more distant future, it's conceivable this technology could eventually be used even in more mainstream electric cars. The car's name means ""Third Millennium"" in Italian. Lamborghini hopes to have it all working long before then."
"But one city known for the maritime industry is emerging as one of the fast-growing tech scenes outside the U.S. Oslo, Norway's capital city, experienced a 160% uptick in startup investments in the past year, according to Oslo's 2017 State of the City report. That's the second biggest jump in the Nordic region behind Sweden, up 171%. ""There's a booming startup scene in Oslo,"" said Tellef Thorleifsson, a founding partner of the Norwegian VC Northzone. ""But it's still in the early stages."" Norway is the eighth wealthiest nation in the world due in part to its biggest export: oil. It was recently ranked as the happiest country on Earth by the United Nations 2017 World Happiness Report. The country's sovereign wealth fund just topped $1 trillion dollars last month. But in recent years, Norway has had to compete with lower oil prices in the Middle East and Venezuela. Now, its leaders are looking to eco-friendly tech as the next big money maker -- a natural evolution for the country, which has long been committed to sustainability. It's currently one of the only countries to have a tax on carbon emissions, and the government offers a 25% subsidy for fuel efficient vehicles. Related: Where are the world's happiest countries? ""If you're gonna solve the world's biggest issues today, you really need technology and innovation,"" Crown Princess of Norway Mette-Marit told CNN. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are encouraging more entrepreneurs to take advantage of investors interested in funding socially minded startups. Last year, there were 78 investments in Norwegian tech companies -- totaling $100 million, according to the 2017 State of the City report. About 15% of tech investments in the country were focused on sustainability, the highest among all the Nordic countries, research firm Nordic Web finds. Other northern European cities such as Denmark and Helsinki have some cache for producing successful tech startups like Spotify and Rovio, maker of Angry Birds. ""The quality of the entrepreneurs we see [in the country] now compared to 10 years ago is a lot higher, "" said Thorleifsson of Norwegian VC Northzone. Thorleifsson was an early investor in Spotify and has a diverse portfolio of digital tech companies -- the majority of which are from Scandinavia. Northzone is an investor in the Norwegian company Kahoot!, a game-based learning platform primarily used in schools. It boasts 50 million monthly unique users. ""There's a lot of capital in Oslo and a lot of money going into tech,"" said Kahoot! CEO Erik Harrell. ""I think those elements helped make Oslo a good place to start companies."" While most of Kahoot!'s users are in the U.S., 85% of their funding is from Scandinavia. ""We found getting funding in Europe was fairly easy,"" said Harrell. ""The Nordic venture capital community is fairly small so getting access to [VCs] wasn't that difficult."" While Norway's startup scene has a lot of momentum, the country has only produced one unicorn: the blockchain platform, IOTA. Blockchain is a data base for cryptocurrency, which is not regulated by a central governing body and is used heavily in developing countries. This year alone, Silicon Valley added 44 unicorns. A unicorn is a startup valued at over $1 billion. But since 2014, Silicon Valley's share of global unicorns has decreased by almost 50%, according to Northzone's analysis of data published in the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, the number of unicorns in Asia and Europe has grown significantly -- up 400% and 700%, respectively -- in just three years.

""[Norway] is still much less mature compared to many other parts of the world, which opens up great opportunities for attentive investors,"" said Kveim. One of those investors was Nordic Impact, a VC firm that invests solely in companies with sustainability-focused business models. It was an early investor in the nearly year-old startup CHOOOSE, which focuses on eliminating the carbon footprint of big businesses. The company works with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the EU Emissions Trading System to sell carbon emission quotas to the average person and socially-conscious companies. The process of purchasing carbon quotas is typically reserved for big corporations with a large carbon footprint. The move makes the carbon quotas less available for big polluters. Related: How Norway is changing the way we drink coffee ""[We've had investor interest] because we've found a good way to connect idealism with green capitalism,"" said Kveim.

""[Young people] want to buy good products that are good for the planet, and they're willing to pay premium prices for it,"" Lier said. As startups continue to grow and look for funding, some are attracting attention from outside the country, too. ""Many investors we're [talking to] now are coming from outside of Norway,"" said Kveim of CHOOOSE. ""The vision and mission of the company seems to have no borders."""

"But the bottlenecks and delays getting the new assembly lines up and running have prompted at least one shareholder lawsuit alleging that Tesla and Musk improperly hid its problems from its investors. And six other law firms have issued statements recently seeking investors to be plaintiffs in planned class action suits against the electric car maker. Tesla said on Oct. 2 that it could only build 260 of its Model 3 cars during the third quarter, rather than the 1,500 it had forecast to investors earlier in the year. The company claimed that ""a handful"" of assembly lines had taken ""longer to activate than expected."" Related: Tesla factory at center of discrimination lawsuits On Oct. 6 the Wall Street Journal did a story, quoting unnamed sources within the company, saying that the problem was that major portions of the new cars were still being built by hand rather than on automated assembly lines. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) lost 4% the next trading day, and have lost an additional 6% since then. At that time, Tesla issued a statement disputing that article, saying that every Model 3 is being built on an automated assembly line. ""However, every vehicle manufacturing line in the world has both manual and automated processes,"" said the company's Tuesday statement. ""As we've always acknowledged, it will take time to fine-tune the line for higher volumes."" The company said it is confident it can correct bottlenecks soon, and that it laid out potential short-term problems for investors back in July when it unveiled the first Model 3. ""There's a reason it's called production hell,"" said its statement.

"I'm testing the new $250 Kindle Oasis, the high-end e-reader from Amazon. After 10 years, the company has finally made a waterproof Kindle presumably so you can read at the beach, during a water-balloon fight, or in a tub. Everything is going great. The wedge-shaped Oasis is lightweight and fits snugly in one hand. Once I get past the busy home screen and plunge into a book, the text looks amazing. The screen is matte with subtle backlighting that feels like a relief after staring at computer and smartphone screens for hours. It seemed like the perfect reading device for the bath. Then I made the mistake of getting it wet. Water, it turns out, triggers the Oasis touchscreen. One small splash can turn the page, change the font size, exit the book or do anything else a rogue hand might. In my tests, it didn't take more than one fat droplet to activate the 7-inch touchscreen. The Oasis can be submerged in two meters of fresh water for up to an hour and not break, according to specifications. But if you had dreams of reading underwater, cancel them. When I dunk the Oasis the screen gets hopelessly confused, the font goes up and down, and I lose my place. (Update: Amazon notes that the Oasis is not meant to be read while underwater.) Sensitivity to water is not an uncommon issue for capacitive touchscreens like the Kindle's. They work by sensing electrical charges from fingers and hands. Like our fingers, water can also conduct electricity. That makes the Kindle Oasis almost unusable in wet environments. Related: Kindle's new app still won't let you buy books on an iPhone Newer smartphones have engineered their screens not to react to water. Waterproof phones from Samsung and Apple might actually be a better fit for bathing than the Kindle Oasis. (Never use devices in a bath while they are plugged in.) Amazon says the devices were ""thoroughly tested"" for water sensitivity. ""While a large amount of water on the screen may trigger the display, most customers will not encounter issues when reading near water. On the off chance the display is triggered, simply wipe the water off and continue reading,"" said an Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) spokesperson. E-readers may have already peaked in popularity. E-book sales dropped 15.6% in 2016, according to the Association of American Publishers. Waterproofing seemed like the one thing that could actually make the $250 Kindle Oasis worth the steep price. It's by far the most expensive Kindle, and it's hard to justify the cost when Amazon still makes the excellent $120 Paperwhite. The Oasis does add support for audio books over Bluetooth connected headphones or speakers. Maybe you're best off listening to a book in the tub."
"It's called Project Loon, and it was developed by X, a former branch of Google that became part of Alphabet (GOOG) when the company restructured. The idea is to broaden coverage using balloons that function like mobile cell towers. To bring the service to Puerto Rico, X needed a telecommunications partner in the area. That's where AT&T came in. The companies said Friday they are ""now supporting basic communication"" for ""some people with LTE enabled phones."" People will be able to use the ""limited"" Loon service to access the internet and send text messages, though the companies couldn't say how many customers may have gained new access to coverage. The Federal Communications Commission said up to 30 balloons can fly. An X spokesperson said there's already a ""handful"" of balloons in the region and more are on the way. Puerto Rico's cash crisis: 35% of banks still closed One month after Hurricane Maria ripped through the island, more than 68% of Puerto Rico's cell sites are still out of service, according to the FCC. (Cell sites are pieces of equipment, like cell towers, that provide coverage.) The island's fragile infrastructure continues to impede companies, including AT&T, from restoring service to many areas of the island. So, they've turned to alternative technologies. Temporary satellite-based cell sites are serving some areas. And the goal for Loon is to reach the hardest hit parts of the island. But there are limitations. A spokesman for AT&T (T, Tech30) said the balloons work via solar power, so they cannot provide service at nighttime. Loon did prove to be effective for flooded areas of Peru earlier this year. Misery in Puerto Rico: No power, no job, 'enormous' lines X said the reason Loon was up and running so quickly in Peru was because the group had already been working alongside Telef¨®nica (TEF). Their systems were already integrated and tests were conducted in the months before Loon ramped up its internet coverage. In Puerto Rico, however, X essentially had to start at square one. The Federal Communications Commission issued an ""experimental license"" to X on October 7, and at that point, X still did not yet have a telecommunications partner for the project. ""We've never deployed Project Loon connectivity from scratch at such a rapid pace,"" Loon project director Alastair Westgarth said in a blog post Friday. ""Project Loon is still an experimental technology and we're not quite sure how well it will work, but we hope it helps get people the information and communication they need to get through this unimaginably difficult time."" (AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending regulatory approval.)"
"The city announced on Thursday a program called NYCx to help the city better prepare for and shape the future. NYCx will focus on coming innovations such as 5G connectivity, self-driving cars or artificial intelligence, and how they can make the city equitable and sustainable.

In an unlikely move for a city, New York is also hiring a senior futurist to gather insights on possible cultural, economic and environmental changes ahead. Futurists say that good forecasting can save cities billion of dollars by making prescient policies and decisions that can have an impact for 40 or 50 years. Some of the world's best businesspeople, such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, are considered futurists. They use a forward-looking philosophy to chart their companies' strategies.

Gami?o, a former entrepreneur in the voice-over-IP space, has a background in municipal tech roles in El Paso, Texas, San Francisco and now, New York. He said he's familiar with how governments often find themselves trying to catch up to new technologies. ""The phrase 'the only thing that's constant is change' needs to be adjusted to 'the only thing constant is the increasing pace of change,'"" Gami?o said.

"One startup thinks it has a solution that will reduce damage caused by monster storms. U.S.-based Opti has developed technology that helps cities predict flooding, and better control where rain water is diverted and stored. Opti has already attracted over $11 million in funding from impact investors, who want to prevent destruction and help the environment while achieving a financial return. ""We felt like it had the potential to have a really tremendous positive impact on resilience and pollution associated with storms,"" said Jeff Possick, managing director at MissionPoint Partners. Possick, whose firm is Opti's largest investor, said the tech firm also represented an ""attractive investment."" How does it work? One way that cities protect against flooding is by using retention ponds. When a storm hits, rainwater runs into these ponds, which store the water. But major storms can bring too much water for the ponds to handle, and the resulting overflow often ends up in rivers or streams that burst their banks and cause flooding. Opti helps prevent overflow with software that monitors weather forecasts and predicts how water levels in retention ponds should be adjusted. As a big storm approaches, the Opti system will remotely open a discharge valve and drain ponds to make room for the expected rainfall. When the rain stops, the system will gradually release excess water in a way that doesn't overwhelm nearby rivers.  Reducing harm The technology won't eliminate flooding after a major natural disaster, but Opti says it can help limit the damage. It has already been installed at over 130 sites across 21 states in the U.S. Hurricane Irma recently provided a real life test when it swept through Ormond Beach, Florida, where Opti systems are installed at five interconnected lakes. The system drained the lakes as Irma approached, leaving them able to handle the eight inches of rain brought by the storm. Opti founder and CEO Marcus Quigley said there was no localized flooding in the area. He predicted that roads would have been inundated with water if the system had not been in place. The benefits could multiply with scale. CFO Chris Holden said that installing Opti systems at hundreds of sites across a city would provide a more complete picture of how each should be regulated. ""We've been very successful at proactively controlling individual sites and the plan is to be able to scale that to be able to control whole watersheds,"" said Holden."
"Larissa May, who was a student at Vanderbilt University, had an enviable Instagram account. In addition to studying, May was a fashion blogger known for her site ""Livinlikelarz."" She covered high-profile events such as New York Fashion Week. Her perfectly curated posts showed a glamorous lifestyle. But the other side of her story was different. May worked 17-hour days, struggling to balance schoolwork with her blog and interning. She felt sleep deprived and suffered from severe anxiety. She noticed a disconnect from reality and what was shown on her life online. It led her to launch ""Half the Story,"" a brand that lives primarily on Instagram and Facebook. Alongside beautifully filtered photos, captions shine a light on topics not often discussed like depression, anxiety, envy and feelings of inadequacy. ""My friends and family know I'm entrepreneurial,"" one caption reads. ""They've listened to my countless business ideas and have seen me start, stop, start, stop projects throughout my adult life. The fact is, I've mostly been a 'wantrapreneur.'"" The accounts, run by May and her team of five, are based on user submissions. Although it's common to use social media to portray an ideal version of oneself or ""build one's personal brand,"" the platforms also have ""an impact on the presence of our spirits."" May said some Instagram users have reached out and shared thoughts of self-harm. ""We respond to every message and have a protocol for how to handle those,"" said May, who sends them online mental health resources.

One of the assignments during May's workshop at Fordham was for attendees to write down the five most important values to them and two things with which they're struggling. Sheedy said it helped create a dialogue to openly discuss the issues they're battling. Nance Roy, chief clinical officer at JED, a nonprofit focused on emotional health and suicide prevention among teens and young adults, stressed that social media can be used in a multiplicity of ways. This includes encouraging conversations like those on Half The Story or offering more tech solutions, like Facebook's pattern recognition algorithm, that can help detect individuals who may on the brink of self-harm. ""[Students] aren't running to counseling sessions,"" said Roy. ""There are tons of kids [counselors on college campuses] are not reaching.""

"As a candidate, Donald Trump repeatedly attacked the Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) CEO and threatened to create ""such problems"" for his company if he was elected president. Then he became president. Now, Bezos is standing on top of the world. Literally. On Thursday, Bezos tweeted a dramatic video of himself wearing a hard hat and smashing a champagne bottle (price tag unknown) on top of a windmill hundreds of feet in the air. The ""christening"" video was intended to showcase Amazon's latest wind farm, but it is also just the latest example of one of the world's most influential billionaires appearing to flaunt his impact and success this year. In March, Bezos shared a photo of himself testing out a giant mechanical robot suit at a conference, prompting more than a couple dystopian headlines. In August, he tweeted a picture of his meeting with Defense Secretary James Mattis, looking like a president in waiting. And then there was the photograph of Bezos walking through the elite Sun Valley Conference this summer sporting big sunglasses and bigger biceps beneath a polo shirt and unbuttoned vest. The image inspired one meme about Bezos as an action hero and another about how much Bezos had evolved from his, shall we say, bookish beginnings.

The Washington Post, which Bezos bought in 2013 for $250 million, is now profitable and topping one billion pageviews a month. Just this week, his rocket company Blue Origin announced a game-changing rocket engine.  Despite occasional Twitter attacks from President Trump, Amazon has only become more of a juggernaut this year. Trump's Federal Trade Commission promptly approved Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, paving the way for it to upend yet another industry. One analysis found Amazon was mentioned on more than 100 earnings calls last quarters as businesses and investors weigh the ""Amazon effect"" across a wide range of industries. How powerful is the Amazon effect? All it took was a whisper of its interest in meal-kit delivery services to shatter Blue Apron (APRN)'s stock. While top execs at Facebook (FB, Tech30), Google (GOOGL, Tech30) and Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) wrestle with greater scrutiny over their potential impact on the 2016 election, city officials across North America are throwing cactuses and tax breaks at Bezos. It's all part of a billion-dollar corporate sweepstakes where Bezos is the judge and the prize is Amazon's next headquarters. Soon enough, Bezos may share a picture of himself standing beside a beaming mayor or governor with an ambitious construction site in the background.

Even if Mexico was in the running, the language barrier would pose a concern, said Joseph Parilla, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. But a number of Canadian cities seem like they could fit the bill. Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Halifax, Montreal and Ottawa have all submitted formal proposals for the new facility. Called HQ2, it will cost at least $5 billion to construct, and create as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs. Related: Cities make last-ditch effort for Amazon's second headquarters Canada could be an attractive option given both its ability to bring in foreign workers and the uncertainty surrounding America's immigration policy, said Ravi Madhavan, a professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. ""If [Amazon] wants to hire tens of thousands of tech employees, it has to be thinking about the visa environment. [Canada] will give them a terrific hedge,"" he said. ""I would be very surprised if the people at Amazon would rule that out."" Representatives for Canadian cities echoed that sentiment. ""Canada's immigration system, with a two-week turnaround time for tech workers' visas, is incredibly welcoming,"" a spokeswoman for the Vancouver Economic Commission said. The Toronto region published a nearly 200 page bid for the headquarters on Thursday. It highlighted Canada's immigration policy as a major draw, and calculated that Amazon could save up to $600 million per year from Canada's universal health care system. Related: 8 cities fit for Amazon's second headquarters But given the current political environment in the U.S., going with Canada would be tricky. President Trump, who campaigned on a doctrine of ""America First"" and promised to create 25 million jobs, has publicly derided U.S. companies with foreign outposts. He's also criticized Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Twitter. ""I don't know if Amazon wants to get in a Twitter back-and-forth with the president, but I'm guessing if they announce that they're going to put 50,000 jobs in Toronto instead of the United States, there would be backlash,"" Parilla said. Sean Speer, a senior fellow for fiscal policy at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in Ottawa, said uncertainty surrounding the North American Free Trade Agreement may also make Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) uneasy. The U.S., Canada and Mexico are in the process of renegotiating the trade pact. ""[Amazon] might feel safer staying in the U.S. market,"" Speer said. Incentive packages could also be a factor. Canadian cities may not be able to offer tax breaks of the same magnitude, said Laura Dawson, director of the Wilson Center's Canada Institute. ""It's a war they have a really hard time winning, because they don't have pockets that are as deep as other [U.S.] competitors,"" Dawson added."
"You may also get a fact about otters or elbow licking, and hear a dad joke. This oddball feature is one of the few unique things on the new Harmon Kardon Invoke. The $200 smart speaker, available October 22, is the first to use Microsoft's Cortana voice assistant. Microsoft has taken a different approach from Amazon, Google and Apple for its first foray into voice-activated speakers. Instead of building its own device, Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) let speaker company Harman Kardon design one specifically to work with Cortana. Other brands are also working on Cortana speakers. The result has sound superior to smart speakers made by Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Google (GOOG). The Cortana assistant has the most natural sounding voice of the bunch but sub-par assisting powers, at least for now. A tall tapered column of black metal, the Invoke looks similar to the original Amazon Echo, including the undulating blue LED light on top. Inside there are three tweeters and three mid-ranger drivers pointed in different directions for 360-degree sound. It has seven microphones, also arranged to pick up the wake phrase from any direction. (Speaking of the wake phrase, making it ""Hey Cortana"" and not just ""Cortana"" is a puzzling decision). Released three years ago, Cortana has been available on Windows 10 devices and in smartphone apps. The company has put a lot of work and resources into the assistant. Cortana's responses are very smooth and natural sounding, often more human-like than Alexa or Google Assistant. If voice assistants have personalities, Cortana is super friendly, hyper and a little corny. It can talk too much and some answers go on a bit too long, like the way it prefaces each song request with ""And now ..."" It will sometimes use the opportunity to make a groan-worthy joke when it doesn't know an answer to a question you ask it. It's a big fan of animal sounds and enthusiastic expressions like ""Woo-hoo!"" It also told my child a very terrible bedtime story (""You're getting sleepy, very sleepy... good night.""). It could use about 25% less cute. Microsoft's angle is that the Invoke is a smart speaker for professionals. It does a solid job adding events to your Outlook calendar and integrating with Microsoft services. You can't ask Cortana to send emails, but it does integrate with Skype for phone calls and lets you set reminders. There are some rough spots. Sometimes its reaction time can be extremely slow. Tapping the top of the device doesn't always work. Since Microsoft has no music service of its own, the Invoke defaults to Spotify, TuneIn or iHeart Radio. Pandora isn't currently supported. While the sound quality is tops compared to the current Alexa and Google Assistant-powered devices, it might have more competition from the new Sonos with Alexa, the Google Home Max and Apple HomePod -- the latter two coming later this year. This speaker will work best for anyone tied-up in the Microsoft ecosystem. People who use Outlook, Skype and the Microsoft owned Wunderlist. Currently, it only has about 100 third-party skills (that seems to be the agreed upon term for voice assistant apps), but more are expected soon. By the end of this year, there will be four major competing voice assistants in speakers. Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. All but Siri will be available in third-party speakers. (Samsung has teased the idea of a Bixby speaker, but there's no launch date.) As the competition heats up, things are getting prickly between the companies, potentially forcing customers to choose a side. You could end up choosing a smart speaker based on what works most with the services and smart gadgets you already have. Microsoft is a late arrival, but it has a natural audience of people already using Windows devices and Cortana. For everyone else, it's probably worth waiting to see what skills come out, and how the HomePod and new Google and Amazon speakers perform before committing to living in a Cortana home. Unless you're really into cute animal sounds. Cortana is the best in the field at those."
"According to a report, an overheating laptop battery could cause a significant fire in a cargo hold that fire fighting equipment aboard the plane would not be able to extinguish. That could ""lead to the loss of the aircraft,"" according to the proposal. The ban will be considered by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations organization, at its meeting this month. Even if the organization endorses the proposal from its Dangerous Goods Panel, which is making the recommendation, it would be up to regulators in individual nations to pass rules to enforce it. The U.S. FAA has no comment on the proposal. But it is represented on the panel that is supporting the ban, and its research on the risk of fires from laptops is included in the proposal. Specifically, the FAA's report raises concerns if a laptop battery were to catch fire in a bag that also holds aerosol cans, it could cause the kind of catastrophic fire that could bring down a plane. One of the fears is that by being in the cargo hold, the fire could build past the point where it can be extinguished before it could be detected by the plane's crew. The good news is that the FAA found that there is a relatively low frequency of laptops being checked in baggage. Most people prefer to carry the laptops with them in the cabin, where any problem can be quickly detected and a fire put out before it spreads. Related: Researchers create battery with built-in fire extinguisher The concern that lithium batteries pose a fire hazard on planes isn't new. There have been studies on the risk of fires on planes posed by lithium batteries going back years. In 2015 U.S. airlines banned hoverboards from their planes due to concerns about the fire risk posed by their lithium batteries. The fear that terrorists could try to hide explosives in laptops prompted the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to ban laptops from the cabin of planes coming from certain international airports earlier this year. That prompted more people to check the laptops in their bags. At that time some argued the rule posed its own safety problems due the risk of fires from those laptops Those rules banning laptops from cabins have been removed for most of those airports due to new screening procedures."
"But over the past seven months, Reitano has told business partners, his girlfriend of four years, investors, and now the world. He's even created a business, called Roman, to help men discretely seek treatment. The startup connects them with doctors online who can diagnose ailments and write prescriptions, and Roman sends medication to their doorsteps. The startup has received $3.1 million in venture capital. The funding news came the same week as another major investment in men's health: hims, which prescribes and sells men's hair loss prevention medications, received $7 million. Erectile dysfunction and hair loss are not topics men typically feel comfortable discussing. But entrepreneurs see them as business opportunities and hope to eliminate the stigma associated with the conditions along the way. Reitano knows first hand the challenges of having a health issue tied to how many view masculinity. ""[The ability to achieve an erection] is associated with being a real man,""said Reitano. But erectile dysfunction is often a warning sign to serious health issues such as heart disease, high cholesterol and diabetes. In Reitano's case, it was related to a heart condition. Related: At 78, investor tackles something personal: hearing aids According to Doron Stember, an assistant professor of urology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, patients often don't seek treatment for years due to the stigma. Erectile dysfunction affects as many as 30 million American men, according to the James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute at Johns Hopkins University. But experts and researchers report only a small percentage (about 25%) seek treatment. ""Many patients don't seek care because they're embarrassed or don't know where to go,"" Stember said. ""Some patients have been told it's a problem in their head so they suffer but don't follow up for years."" Counterfeit medication is also a big problem, with some online retailers peddling cheap, fake pills which may be filled with toxic chemicals. The condition is traditionally associated with older men, but Reitano experienced it for the first time at age 17. About 26% of those who seek treatment for the first time are under the age of 40. To ask a doctor's opinion on Roman, users answer questions about their medical history and sexual health, upload a photo of themselves to verify identity, scan a picture of an ID such as a driver's license, and list medication preferences. A licensed physician reviews the information and can chat with a patient through the site. A doctor can ultimately prescribe medication, such as Viagra or Cialis. The process costs $15, plus the cost of the medicine. It's available in New York, California, Florida and Pennsylvania. Roman ships the medication directly to customers in discrete packaging. Prescriptions can also be filled at a pharmacy. Telehealth services are increasingly popular, offering up digital connections to licensed professionals that consumers can take advantage of in the comfort of their homes. But some warn that not all telehealth companies provide the same level of care. ""Telehealth can increase access to excellent sexual health care for men who have emotional or geographic barriers keeping them out of the office,"" Stember said. ""But medications have real risks, and some patients have specific conditions that should be considered as part of treatment decisions. ... Patients should only use telehealth platforms that can provide the standard of individualized care they'd expect in specialists' offices."" Its investors include Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, VC firm General Catalyst and publisher Forbes. (Along with sportswear startup Outdoor Voices, Roman is one of Forbes' first two startup investments). Related: STDs are at an all-time high: At-home tests want to help Similarly, Andrew Dudum, founder of hims, the hair loss prevention startup, wants to talk more about men's health. ""We hope to enable a conversation that's currently closeted,"" the company's site states. ""Men aren't supposed to care for themselves. We call bull----."" Hims launched last week with investment from Forerunner Ventures, Thrive Capital and shaving products startup Harry's. Users of hims complete a free online questionnaire. Doctors then suggest a treatment plan and possible prescription. Hims' medical team is available for questions before and after products are prescribed. While hair loss is not something men can control, products can slow the process: Hims sells hair loss pills, shampoos, supplements and other products.  For Dudum, like Reitano, hims' mission is personal. ""Ever since the age of 10, I've been terrified of losing my hair,"" said Dudum. His mother's father became bald at age of 30. He's not alone in his fear: ""I've watched [friends] really struggle with it."" The platform plans to expand into skincare and sexual wellness, including erectile dysfunction treatment. Roman and hims join the growing list of startups taking on stigmatized topics. For example, myLABBox sells at-home STD tests, while Addicaid's app helps addicts log and track their recovery process."
"The tech company has partnered with NASA to help it develop air traffic management systems for its flying taxi initiatives, chief product officer Jeff Holden said on Wednesday. Holden made the announcement at Web Summit, a technology conference in Lisbon. In April, Uber unveiled its plans to introduce flying taxi fleets, known as uberAIR. The four-person ridesharing flights won't become a reality anytime soon but Holden said there are plans for demos coming to Los Angeles in 2020. Uber previously announced cities Dallas, Texas and Dubai as other partner cities. The tech firm has agreements to work with other aviation companies, but this is the first time it has formally partnered with a federal U.S. agency. Uber's partnership is part of NASA's Space Act Agreement, a consortium of industry players working to ensure ""safe and efficient operations"" of its taxis and other small unmanned aerial systems flying at low altitudes. ""These are exactly the kind of partners we need to make uberAIR a reality,"" Holden said of NASA. A NASA spokesman said Wednesday the agency will help create a framework for the air traffic management of drones. This will help pave the way for air vehicles carrying passengers, such as uberAIR. In 2019, the recommendations developed by NASA and its partners will be shared with the Federal Aviation Administration, which will determine how they should be integrated into existing air traffic systems. Known for its unmanageable traffic, Los Angeles will make for an interesting test bed for the flying vehicles. To get a sense, Uber projects that trips from the Los Angeles airport to the Staples Center during rush hour will take less than 30 minutes -- down from 1 hour 20 minutes by car. It expects to offer rides in the flying taxis for prices comparable to its UberX service. The goal is to make transportation fast, and inexpensive -- and it hopes the service will be ready for commercial operations ""several years ahead"" of the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. Updated: This story was updated to add more details about NASA's involvement in the project."
"The actress, who was recently named in a New York Times expose alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, has been tweeting about the scandal since it broke. Weinstein was forced out of his company after several women came forward alleging he had harassed them and acted inappropriately. More accusations, including alleged rape, have since surfaced. McGowan Instagrammed a photo of a notification from Twitter late Wednesday saying the site had ""determined that this account had violated the Twitter Rules, so we temporarily limited some of your account features."" This left McGowan unable to tweet for 12 hours, according to the notification. The caption on her official Instagram account said: ""TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE."" The company has since tweeted an explanation. ""We have been in touch with Ms. McGowan's team,"" Twitter said in a tweet on Thursday. ""We want to explain that her account was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates of our Terms of Service."" Twitter clarified that McGowan's account had been unlocked and the offending tweet was removed. ""Twitter is proud to empower and support the voices on our platform, especially those that speak truth to power,"" the final tweet said. ""We stand with the brave women and men who use Twitter to share their stories, and will work hard every day to improve our processes to protect those voices."" Related: Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal grows Twitter does not typically comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons. Twitter can temporarily block a user for a variety of reasons, including abusive content and threats. But speculation on why her account was suspended became the center of online chatter. ""We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future,"" Twitter said in a tweet. Some of McGowan's tweets alleged that people in the industry, including Weinstein's brother Bob and actor Ben Affleck, were aware of what's been called Hollywood's open secret. pic.twitter.com/f5AgemRXds The Weinstein Company's board of directors -- which includes Bob Weinstein -- issued a statement Tuesday stating ""these alleged actions are antithetical to human decency."" ""These allegations come as an utter surprise to the Board,"" the statement said. ""Any suggestion that the Board had knowledge of this conduct is false."" Affleck later posted a message on social media about Harvey Weinstein, who helped launch his career with the 1997 film ""Good Will Hunting."" ""I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades,"" Affleck wrote. ""The additional allegations of assault that I read this morning made me sick."" Dear most of Hollywood, this is happening. You cannot sweep this under the rug.

We have just begun. #ROSEARMY pic.twitter.com/r5yPL2A3bC McGowan called for the board of Weinstein's company to be dissolved in a tweet. She believes it was complicit in Weinstein's alleged behavior. The actress urged people to support a petition started by an anonymous person on the website iPetitions. ""If you believe The Weinstein Company should completely dissolve after 30 years of sexual abuse against innocent women please join me in signing this petition to honor the victims and their bravery,"" the petition reads. TWC You don't get to change your company name & be done with it. Every man there has the blood of sorrow on their hands. You are dirty. As of Thursday morning, it had more than 13,000 signatures, exceeding its goal of 10,000. The ""Charmed"" star was not quoted in the Times story. CNN has not spoken with McGowan about the alleged sexual misconduct. Film director Paul Feig, who has condemned Weinstein, tweeted about the move to block McGowan's Twitter account. Wow, @Twitter, seriously? THIS is the account you suspend but not Trump who threatened to wipe out another country? Suspend me too, please. https://t.co/ZHhvIkfEcN ""Wow, @Twitter, seriously,"" Feig wrote. ""THIS is the account you suspend but not Trump who threatened to wipe out another country?

"On Thursday, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) released an iOS update to fix an issue some people experienced where a lower-case letter ""i"" automatically corrected to an ""A"" and a question mark symbol. The issue seemed to impact iPhone users on its most recent mobile software, iOS 11.1. The new software launched last week and includes hundreds of new emoji options. Related: iPhone bug frustrates users typing 'i' Not only did the bug frustrate many people, some complained on social media that Apple was taking too long to fix the issue. ""iPhone [has] face recognition but still hasn't fixed the letter glitch,"" wrote one Twitter user.  Before releasing the update, Apple suggested a workaround. Users could select the Keyboard settings and add a text replacement to circumvent the issue. ""For Phrase, type an upper-case 'I,'"" Apple said on its website. ""For Shortcut, type a lower-case 'i.'"" The new update also fixed an issue where ""Hey Siri"" -- which alerts Apple's voice assistant -- stopped working. It's not unusual for new software to have bugs. A previous version of iOS 11 had a problem with the calculator app and miscalculated the result of 1+2+3. CNN Tech's Selena Larson contributed to this report."
"The company announced Thursday that it is pausing all ""general verifications"" because of ""confusion"" over the policy. The decision comes days after Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) authenticated an account belonging to the man who organized this summer's white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Critics attacked the company for a move they said gave credibility and significance to white nationalism. ""Verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance,"" Twitter said. ""We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it."" In another tweet, CEO Jack Dorsey said the company ""realized some time ago the system is broken and needs to be reconsidered."" ""And we failed by not doing anything about it,"" he added. We should've communicated faster on this (yesterday): our agents have been following our verification policy correctly, but we realized some time ago the system is broken and needs to be reconsidered. And we failed by not doing anything about it. Working now to fix faster. https://t.co/wVbfYJntHj  Related: Twitter's plan to police hate speech and symbols Twitter has long verified accounts belonging to celebrities, journalists, government officials, companies and other noteworthy people. Such accounts receive a small, coveted blue badge with a white check mark. But that system came under fire this week after Jason Kessler, who put together the August ""Unite the Right"" protest in Charlottesville, said he had been verified by the company. ""Looks like I FINALLY got verified by Twitter,"" Kessler tweeted. ""I must be the only working class white advocate with that distinction."" Other users immediately took Twitter to task. ""This is disgusting,"" tweeted the comedian Michael Ian Black. ""Verifying white supremacists reinforces the increasing belief that your site is a platform for hate speech. I don't want to give up Twitter, but I may have to. Who do you value more, users like me or him?"" Hey @jack: very active user, 2.1M followers here: this is disgusting. Verifying white supremacists reinforces the increasing belief that your site is a platform for hate speech. I don't want to give up Twitter, but I may have to. Who do you value more, users like me or him? https://t.co/5ymcNfFvH0  Kessler did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Twitter's latest decision. Twitter has long grappled with questions and controversy about speech on its platform. Last month, Dorsey promised that there would be more aggressive rules to address ""unwanted sexual advances, non-consensual nudity, hate symbols, violent groups, and tweets that glorifies violence."" His company said it would blur hateful imagery and symbols as it does adult content and graphic violence, meaning users would need to manually opt in to see it. But Twitter didn't outline in its policy memo what it considered to be a hate symbol. --CNNMoney's Sara Ashley O'Brien contributed to this story."
"CEO Dara Khosrowshahi confirmed on Thursday that the company's ""target"" is to go public in 2019. The move is a departure from his predecessor, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, who had tried to put off an IPO as long as possible. ""We have all of the disadvantages of being a public company, as far as the spotlight on us, without any of the advantages of being a public company,"" Khosrowshahi said on stage at the New York Times DealBook Conference in Manhattan. ""Travis and the whole board now agree that we should just go public,"" he added. Uber currently has a valuation of $70 billion, which makes it the most highly valued startup in the world. The company has raised more than $10 billion in capital since its founding in 2009. SoftBank (SFTBF), the Japanese conglomerate, has also been in discussions with Uber for a massive private investment expected to total in the billions. Khosrowshahi expressed confidence about getting Uber's entire board on the same page and closing the deal. Related: Uber's next CEO: Who is Dara Khosrowshahi? ""There's negotiations going on,"" he said. ""They've probably taken longer than they should have, but we're gonna get there."" The event marked Khosrowshahi's first extensive interview since taking over as Uber's CEO two months ago. In the conversation, he spoke candidly about his early doubts about the job given Uber's numerous PR crises at the time. ""It was this media circus that honestly I didn't want any part of,"" said Khosrowshahi, describing his initial feelings when he received a call about the CEO search. Khosrowshahi was then the CEO of Expedia (EXPE). A friend, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, later talked him into taking the opportunity seriously. Before joining the company, Khosrowshahi reviewed the company's financial and legal issues, as well as reading the blog post from a former engineer that rocked Uber with allegations of sexual harassment. However, he did not ask to read a report on the failures of Uber's reckless company culture put together by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. ""The culture went wrong, and the governance of the company went wrong and the board went in a very bad direction,"" Khosrowshahi said. ""But if the product is good, then if you can bring in good leadership, you can ultimately bring it together."" Earlier this week, Khosrowshahi published a new set of ""cultural norms"" for the company, replacing Uber's ""win at all costs"" mentality with greater emphasis on corporate responsibility and inclusion. One of the norms: ""We do the right thing. Period."" But one of the biggest obstacles for Khosrowshahi's turnaround effort at Uber may be Kalanick. The former CEO continues to serve on Uber's board. In late September, Kalanick blindsided the company by using his power to appoint two new board members. Khosrowshahi admitted Kalanick wants to be more a part of the company than he currently is. ""It's a good relationship, but it comes with balance. What I told Travis very early on is that any new CEO needs space and needs distance from the old CEO,"" Khosrowshahi said. ""I was a little worried about that conversation, but actually he took it very well and he's been very respectful."" Khosrowshahi said he does anticipate leaning on Travis for insights on the business at a later date. ""Over a period of time,"" he said, ""I would be foolish not to use Travis's incredible genius and his knowledge that really was largely responsible for getting the company to where it is now."""
"The Federal Communications Commission has issued an ""experimental license"" to X, the moonshot outfit owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOG), to try and provide service to the ailing island. The project -- called Loon -- could help restore some communications capabilities after Hurricane Maria wiped out Puerto Rico's infrastructure. More than two weeks after the storm, about 82% of the island is still without cell service, the FCC said Saturday. ""We need to take innovative approaches to help restore connectivity on the island. Project Loon is one such approach,"" Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. ""It could help provide the people of Puerto Rico with access to cellular service to connect with loved ones and access life-saving information."" Related: Project Loon helps bring the internet to flooded Peru The project, however, is not without its challenges. Loon works like floating cell towers. Giant balloons are sent about 12 miles up into the Earth's atmosphere. From there, they must work with an on-the-ground telecommunications system. For that to happen, X needs to partner with a telecom company that can provide that connectivity. The system has been proven to work. Earlier this year, X said balloons over Peru were able to provide key coverage as the country was plagued by floods. But the reason Loon was up-and-running so quickly in Peru was because X had already been working alongside Telef¨®nica (TEF). Their systems were already integrated and tests were conducted in the months before Loon ramped up its internet coverage to help flooded areas. In Puerto Rico, however, X essentially had to start at square one. Spokesperson Libby Leahy said X is making ""solid progress on this next step,"" but the company declined to indicate a potential time frame for when the project could come online. --CNN Tech's Selena Larson contributed to this report."
"Inside, the specifications are pretty standard fare. But the devices are running a lovely, uncluttered version of Android that weaves in the very latest Googley innovations and a handful of inspired tricks. The Pixel is Google's answer to the iPhone. When the first Pixel-branded phone came out last year, its closest competition (Samsung's Note 7) was yanked off the market for bursting into flames. The Pixel launch should have been an easy opening, but getting one proved problematic due to limited supplies. Now, the device only makes up less than 1% of the global smartphone market, according to Comscore. After years of Google's somewhat erratic approach to phone hardware, is the company finally ready to commit? The basics The new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are Google's flagship smartphones. The smaller Pixel 2 has a 5-inch screen and starts at $649, while the Pixel 2 XL features a 6-inch screen and starts at $849. Both devices are available with 64 GB or 128 GB of storage. Unlike iPhones, the two Pixels have almost identical features, including the cameras and processors, but the XL does pack a bigger battery. Both phones are waterproof and dust-proof. Last year, the company rebranded its hardware line as ""Made By Google."" The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL are technically manufactured by HTC and LG, respectively, but Google says it is completely in charge of the design for the line. The previous flagship Google phone was the Nexus, which it made in partnership with major manufacturers from 2010 to 2015. The company's other adventures in phone hardware include buying and then selling Motorola, and its modular Project Ara phone, which never made it to market. The cameras Smartphones live or die by their cameras, and the Pixel has added a handful of new features to stay competitive. Overall, the Pixel's camera takes excellent photos with good dynamic range and warm colors. In low light, the Pixel's images have a bit more noise than iPhone 8 shots. It mimics the iPhone's ""Live Photos"" feature, making mini 3-second motion clips for each still photo. It doesn't have dual lens cameras like the higher-end iPhones, but the Pixel is still imitating one of those devices' most popular features. The new Portrait mode fakes a shallow depth-of-field effect, throwing the background out of focus to draw attention to the subject. In our tests, the Pixel wasn't always as effective as an iPhone at separating the subject from the background. The front camera has a new retouching option that intends to smooth out flaws like wrinkles and acne. In a test, we tried the feature and the results were surprisingly subtle. The fun bits At its event announcing the new Pixel phones earlier this month, Google acknowledged that the next big smartphone advancements won't be about the hardware. They're about software and smarts. On the Pixel, most of those smarts are connected to the Google Assistant. Squeeze the body of the device and bam, Google Assistant appears like an eager puppy. (It would be nice to customize this feature, called Active Edge, to trigger something specific like the selfie camera.) It may be doomed to wander this earth without a relatable human name like Alexa or Siri, but Google Assistant is constantly improving. That, and the company's willingness work with developers, gives it an advantage over aging Siri. One advantage of the Pixel is being the first to test out the latest Google inventions, like Google Lens, the company's image recognition tool. Available only in Google Photos to start, Lens can identify text and objects, like a reverse image search. And you can't have a phone without a silly emoji update, so the Pixel is adding AR stickers like veggies with eyeballs that dance their way onto your videos. The feature actually won't be available for a few months. The Pixel is busy, even when it's asleep. It has an always-on screen that shows the time, and its microphones are constantly listening. If you say ""OK Google"" the phone will spring to life. It will also hear any song playing nearby and name that tune in about 15 seconds. Perhaps Google is betting that the popularity of smart speakers has made the public less uneasy about a device that constantly listens to them. And Google says the phone isn't recording anything and all the listening and processing is done on the device, using a downloaded music catalog. But some people will, rightly, still have privacy concerns. They can turn it off in Settings. The looks The physical design of smartphones is almost irrelevant at this point. The biggest differentiators are the location of buttons and sensors, and what color body you'll obscure with a case (the Pixel comes in black, white or blue). The Pixel design is inoffensive. The back is a nice matte aluminum with a glass panel over the sensors ¡ª an advantage over the latest all-glass iPhones. The fingerprint sensor is in the same awkward spot on the back. After days of frustrated missed attempts to unlock my phone, I started thinking face detection was a good idea for the very first time. Phone manufacturers are fighting over who has the thinnest bezel (the frame around the smartphone screen), but they're overestimating how much casual customers will care about a few millimeters of black space. That said, Google has left quite a bit of bezel on the top and bottom of the screen for its (clear and loud) speakers. The drawbacks The Pixel 2s are higher-end devices, but don't have any specs that will blow other Android phones away. From the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor to the 12.2 megapixel camera, these are all pretty standard. Unfortunately, one of the newest ideas Google borrowed from Apple is that headphone jacks are pass¨¦. Like the recent iPhones, the Pixels include an adapter in case you want to use your old headphones. The single USB Type-C port recreates the same frustrating problems, such as not being able to listen to headphones and charge at the same time. The conclusion If you're searching for the best Android smartphone, the Pixel 2 is a solid choice that packs in the best of Google's apps and AI smarts. This year's Galaxy S8 does not catch fire, so there are more options at this level. The Pixel is fun, the best way to use Google software and test early Google experiments, and freed from the annoying junky apps third-party manufacturers or carriers like to pile on. If you're an iPhone user considering a switch, there's enough to recommend the Pixel 2. But with the iPhone X's release just weeks away, it's worth waiting to see how the devices stack up, especially the cameras."
"The popular peer-to-peer payments application is rolling out a new option this week that lets users make online purchases from more than two million retailers. The initial list of stores includes Lululemon, Foot Locker and Forever 21. The announcement moves Venmo, a service that connects to bank accounts and cards, closer to being a full-fledged payments platform for a broad range of transactions. It also positions Venmo, and its parent company PayPal (PYPL, Tech30), to generate revenue from merchants who are eager to tap into millennial consumers. Related: Move over Venmo. Meet Zelle, the latest mobile payment app ""Our vision for Venmo is to not only be the go-to app for payments between friends, but also a ubiquitous digital wallet that helps consumers spend wherever and however they want to pay, regardless of device,"" Bill Ready, PayPal's COO, said in a statement Tuesday. The shopping option works by tapping into PayPal's existing payments network. When users are shopping on their phones, they can tap on the PayPal checkout button and will see an additional option to pay with Venmo instead. The Venmo option is said to be available ""almost everywhere you see the PayPal button."" As with other transactions on Venmo, you can choose to split the purchase with friends and share playful status updates about what you bought. Venmo, an early darling in the peer-to-peer payment market, now competes with similar offerings from Square (SQ), Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30)."
"Research firm Gartner on Tuesday said worldwide sales of PCs, tablets and smartphones will rise 2% in 2018. That's the highest year-over-year growth since 2015. According to Gartner, it's a ""misconception"" that people rely on PCs less than smartphones. ""Our latest online end-user survey shows that users depend just as much on PCs or tablets as they do on smartphones,"" Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, said in the report. Related: Microsoft tries again with troubled Surface Book line About 40% of the survey's respondents said they mostly use a PC or tablet to read, watch videos and write lengthy emails. Meanwhile, about 34% of study participants said they use a smartphone for its convenience while on the go. Gartner also said the PC market will grow 0.8% in 2018. This would be the first year that PC sales rose since 2011. The study was conducted among more than 16,500 people in the U.S., U.K., Germany, China and India this past summer. Users holding onto their PCs for longer continues to be a major issue for the PC market, according to Atwal. Traditional PC shipments are expected to drop 4.4% in 2018, while mobile phone shipments are projected to grow 2.4%. ""In contrast, users continue to replace their smartphone quite frequently,"" he said. Businesses are starting to buy computers again. Corporate PC shipments are expected to return to growth by the end of 2017, due to faster Windows 10 replacement in regions like Western Europe, according to the firm."

"The new Surface Book 2, announced Tuesday, is a powerful laptop meant to be a daily workhorse computer for professionals. The device's key feature is a detachable screen that can act as a tablet. It will come in two sizes and pack some heavy processing power. Microsoft hopes it can take on the MacBook Pro. The original Surface Book came out two years ago. But in August, Consumer Reports pulled its recommendation for the product, as well as other Surface devices. It made the decision after a survey of more than 91,000 laptop and tablet owners found that 25% of Surface devices have issues by the end of their second year. Related: Is Google's Pixel 2 a worthy iPhone alternative? Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), which hasn't been making laptops for very long, is going to try again. The new Surface Book 2 will start at $1,499. That's the exact same staring price as the original, and $200 more than a MacBook Pro. It comes in 13-inches or 15-inches, and can have Intel i5 or i7 dual-core or quad-core processors. Microsoft says it has five times better graphics performance than the previous Surface Book. It has a backlit keyboard, works with the Surface Pen, and will be compatible with the coming Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Is being able to decapitate your Windows 10 laptop worth the price? The touchscreen can only last up to 5 hours on its own, according to Microsoft (the laptop gets up to 17 hours). If your usual computer use involves creative tasks like retouching or sketching, the tablet feature might be a huge draw. Pre-orders start November 9 and ship the following week."
"The tool, which rolled out as a test for some iOS users, shows how many calories users would burn if they decided to walk to their destination. Then it converts those calories into mini cupcakes.

Related: Florida and Google Maps team up to mark road closures due to Irma While the company likely intended the feature to promote healthy living, it ignited backlash on social media sites.

"At least, that's the plan for Google affiliate Project Wing, which on Tuesday announced new tests of its drone delivery service with two Australian businesses, a Mexican taqueria chain and a drugstore company. It's not the first time the Project Wing team has used drones to send people burritos. It did that last year with Chipotle at Virginia Tech University, but that was ""in an open field, not to a specific address or location,"" said James Ryan Burgess, one of Project Wing's managers. Related: Domino's delivers pizza by drone in New Zealand The Australian tests are taking place in a rural community near Canberra, the national capital, where residents ""face a 40-minute round trip in the car for almost anything, whether it's a carton of milk, veggies for dinner, or a cup of coffee,"" Burgess said in a company blog post. Flying goods right into their yards is a great deal more complicated than navigating a field at Virginia Tech. ""With each delivery, we encounter a new yard space with its own layout of trees, sheds, fences, and power lines,"" Burgess wrote. The issues range from programming the devices to maneuver safely around obstacles like parked cars or outdoor furniture to following customers' wishes to set down perishable food items close to their kitchens.  By bringing in Mexican food chain Guzman y Gomez and drugstore company Chemist Warehouse, Project Wing is adding to the challenges. Its ordering and delivery system will need to handle hot food from Guzman y Gomez and retail goods of all different shapes and sizes from Chemist Warehouse's extensive catalog of products. ""The information we gather from both of these test partners will help us build a system so that merchants of all kinds can focus on what they're good at ¡ª like making food or helping people feel healthier ¡ª rather than being distracted by complex delivery logistics,"" Burgess said.

"Its own devices, such as the Amazon Echo speaker, have brought Alexa to living rooms and kitchens. The Amazon Tap makes Alexa portable, and the forthcoming Echo Spot lets Alexa serve as your alarm clock. Now, Garmin -- maker of GPS devices and wearables -- has created a mini Alexa gadget specifically for the car. Called Garmin Speak, the device is an inch-and-a-half large back circle that mounts on your car window (check your state laws!). It has a blue LED circle, and displays simplified turning directions and arrows on the front. You don't need an exact address to search for locations while driving. The directions come by way of a special Garmin skill -- that's what Amazon calls voice apps. That means using it has the slightly clunky extra step of saying, ""Alexa, ask Garmin to find me a dog groomer."" Related: Amazon unveils new Echo speakers In addition to turn-by-turn GPS directions, the Speak can do the usual Alexa tasks. Distracted driving by those looking at smartphones is a leading cause of car accidents. The ability to request music, start audiobooks or podcasts, and set reminders with just voice commands could help people stay focused on the road. The Speak, which costs $150, connects via a standard port to your car's stereo, so you can hear your news brief, music or terrible Alexa jokes nice and loud. Other voice assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are already in cars, mostly through car settings on smartphones. But Alexa hasn't had a big presence in the drivers seat yet. Ford and BMW are planning on including Alexa capabilities in future cars, but devices like the Speak will be a more affordable way to add Alexa without buying a new car."
"The city council voted on Thursday to make it a misdemeanor to disclose, or to threaten to disclose, the intimate images of someone without their consent and with the intent to cause harm. The act will be punishable of up to 1 year in prison, a $1,000 fine, or both. One in 8 Internet users in the U.S. has been a victim of non-consensual pornography, defined as the distribution of sexually graphic images of someone without his or her consent, according to a study from the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative. Currently, there is no federal revenge porn law, but 38 states and Washington D.C. have enacted laws against revenge porn. New York's state effort has been stalled. In 2014, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill pertaining to unlawful surveillance, making it illegal to spread pictures or videos of someone engaged in sexual acts that was taken without consent. Related: To combat revenge porn, Facebook wants some users to send their intimate photos But that doesn't protect those who've taken images of themselves naked, or in sexual acts, and sent them to a partner. New York City's bill aims to provide a ""very clear road map"" for civil courts, said Councilman Rory Lancman at a press conference ahead of the vote. Mayor Bill de Blasio supports the measure. Pending his signature, the civil portion is effective immediately; the criminal portion takes effect 60 days after becoming law. It does so by giving individuals explicit permission to seek an injunction, and the opportunity to seek compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys' fees, said Lancman. He introduced the bill with Councilman Dan Garodnick in 2016. ""For years, prosecutors have been frustrated by our inability to effectively respond to a problem we see with increased regularity,"" said Eric Rosenbaum, assistant district attorney in Queens County, at Thursday's press conference. ""Special victims and computer crimes prosecutors across the city are hopeful that would-be offenders will now be deterred from engaging in this conduct."" Some advocates for a revenge porn law are unsure the new bill will be as effective as it intends to be. The ""intent to cause harm"" isn't always evident or provable in revenge porn cases, they say. ""New Yorkers deserve a non-consensual porn criminal law ... and that protection should be regardless of the motives of the offender,"" said New York based attorney Carrie Goldberg, who specializes in sexual harassment crimes. Goldberg said the law was a good start. ""Even if the language leaves much to be desired and gives defense attorneys a lot of ways for their clients to escape liability, the bill does have excellent civil measures borrowed from our pending state bill that makes it so lawyers like I can sue if our clients are the victims of non-consensual porn,"" she said. Related: Australia takes on revenge porn Laws against online harassment, including revenge porn, are notoriously weak. For some victims, copyright law has been the only way to get their naked pictures off the Internet ¡ª meaning they need to copyright their naked bodies. The vast majority of non-consensual pornography impacts private citizens, but the issue has made headlines when celebrities have become victims. For example, news surfaced in March 2017 that an ex-boyfriend of actress Mischa Barton was shopping around sexually explicit photos of her. In June, Barton won her case. The court ordered her ex to hand over any explicit videos and images."
"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised a big, powerful truck he has nicknamed ""The Beast."" A teaser image Telsa (TSLA) has released, showing the truck heavily backlit, reveals a tall silhouette with futuristic angular headlights. But Tesla is rolling into a big new market very different from the passenger vehicles it sells now. And the company is already facing major production issues with the cars it already makes. Musk has frequently touted the truck's reveal which was originally set for September, but it's been delayed. Most recently, it was pushed to November because, Tesla said, it needed to divert resources to help restore power in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria -- Tesla makes power storage equipment as well as cars. It also needed to attend to problems with the Model 3 sedan, only 260 of which have been made since July. Now, at an event that will take place at 8pm tonight in California, Tesla will unveil the new truck. Related: Elon Musk: Tesla will reveal semi-truck 'beast' next month It will be a challenging new line of business for Musk, due primarily to basic physics. Semi trucks, which tow large, heavy trailers at high speeds for long distances, are by their very nature not ideal candidates for electric power.  The reason: A semi truck requires lots of energy to run, and more energy means more batteries. Since the whole point of a truck is to carry cargo, a truck that uses a lot of space just to haul its own batteries would be problematic. The truck could use smaller batteries, but then it would have to stop more often to recharge and, in the trucking industry, downtime costs money. Electric delivery trucks are already on the market, delivering goods on local routes. Those sorts of trips, involving relatively short routes at slow speeds that start and end at the same location, are well suited to a battery-powered truck. Power demands are relatively low and the trucks can easily be recharged before each shift. Related: Does Tesla have enough cash to fix Model 3 production woes? That's why many analysts have suggested that Tesla's semi truck would be best used to move cargo from ports to other relatively nearby locations such as rail yards, warehouses or distribution centers. As with smaller delivery trucks, this would involve short trips that would have the truck back at a base location for charging. Toyota (TM) announced last month that it started a program at the Port of Los Angeles to put hydrogen-powered semi-trucks, which face some of the same challenges as battery-powered ones, to just this sort of use. Tesla has also said it's working to apply its semi-autonomous driving technologies to the semi-truck. Other companies are also working to build self-driving semis, including Freightliner, which announced it was testing an autonomously-driven semi-truck back in 2015."
"The Republican-led FCC voted along party lines Thursday to do away with longstanding restrictions on media ownership, potentially giving individuals and companies greater dominance over local media markets. The commission voted to eliminate a rule first adopted in 1975, which prevented entities from owning a radio or TV station and a newspaper in the same market. The FCC also loosened restrictions to make it easier for a company to own multiple TV stations in one market. Ajit Pai, the Trump-appointed chairman of the FCC, framed the move as an attempt to ""strengthen local voices"" and update regulations for the internet era. ""The media ownership regulations of 2017 should match the media marketplace of 2017,"" Ajit Pai, the chairman of the FCC, said in a statement Thursday. ""Few of the FCC's rules are staler than our broadcast ownership regulations."" Related: Some states reluctant to join DOJ against AT&T-Time Warner deal But consumer groups and Democrats in Congress criticized the policy change, saying it will hurt competition in local markets.

Bill Nelson, a Democrat representing Florida, said in a statement. John Bergmayer, senior counsel at Public Knowledge, an advocacy group, said the FCC did not vote to ""modernize"" the rules, but rather ""to abandon them."" The vote marks the latest in a series of controversial moves from the FCC under Pai. The agency is also looking to roll back net neutrality protections, and endorsed Congress's decision to repeal internet privacy protections. The FCC also previously moved to reinstate a rule that allows broadcasters to understate their overall reach. That pave the way for Sinclair Broadcast Group to acquire Tribune Media, a deal that would create a broadcast powerhouse. The FCC vote comes at a time when the Department of Justice is weighing an antitrust lawsuit to block AT&T from buying Time Warner, CNN's parent company."
"Facebook (FB, Tech30), Google (GOOGL, Tech30) and Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) said Thursday they have committed to using new ""trust indicators"" to help users better vet the reliability of the publications and journalists behind articles that appear in news feeds. The indicators were developed by the Trust Project, a non-partisan effort operating out of Santa Clara University's Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, to boost transparency and media literacy at a time when misinformation is rampant. Facebook, which has faced particularly strong criticism about spreading fake news, began testing the indicators on Thursday. Select publishers will have the option to upload additional information about their fact-checking policies, ownership structures, author histories and more. When you see an article from Vox, for example, Facebook may show an icon you can tap to learn more, including what Vox's ethics policy is and who funds it. Related: Facebook's global fight against fake news ""This step is part of our larger efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook ¡ª providing people with more context to help them make more informed decisions,"" Andrew Anker, a product manager at Facebook, wrote in a blog post. Google said it is currently looking into how best to display the indicators next to articles that show up in Google News, Google's search engine and other products. Twitter declined to comment beyond the announcement put out by the Trust Project. ""In today's digitized and socially networked world, it's harder than ever to tell what's accurate reporting, advertising, or even misinformation,"" Sally Lehrman, the journalist who heads the Trust Project, said in a statement. ""The Trust Indicators put tools into people's hands, giving them the means to assess whether news comes from a credible source they can depend on."" Among other details, the indicators will show whether a story is a news report or advertising, highlight other articles the author has published and offer more clarity on the sources used to back up various claims in the story. The Washington Post, The Economist, The Globe and Mail, and other publications are among the initial group of publishers using the indicators. Related: Silicon Valley's 'gut-wrenching' year confronting its dark side Facebook, Google and Twitter were grilled by Congress earlier this month over how foreign nationals used social media platforms to spread misinformation during the 2016 presidential election. At the core of this new scrutiny is a question about whether these companies can properly police the content shared on their own platforms, given their massive audiences. In the year since the election, the tech companies have tried to show they can do better. Facebook and Google have worked with independent fact checking organizations to flag concerning articles. Facebook also introduced related links to provide additional perspectives for stories shared in the News Feed. Separately, Facebook and Twitter have each announced plans to increase transparency for political advertisements that appear on their sites, as U.S. legislators weigh potential regulation for this issue."
"Gamers have complained in recent days that it takes huge amounts of time -- or money -- to unlock features in Star Wars Battlefront II. Regulators in Belgium, meanwhile, are looking at whether the game constitutes a form of gambling. The Belgian Gaming Commission is investigating how players in Battlefront II and similar games are rewarded by unlocking ""looting boxes."" The idea is that players pay real money to unlock a virtual ""looting box"" without knowing what kind of reward is inside. They also don't know how many boxes they might need to unlock in order to finish the game. Peter Naessens, general director of the Belgian Gaming Commission, said the regulator is examining whether the rewards are allocated by chance, and whether this might constitute a form of gambling. In Belgium, companies involved in gambling are required to have a license. Minors and people with gambling addiction problems are not allowed to play. Electronic Arts (EA, Tech30), the game's publisher, said that the ""mechanics of Star Wars Battlefront II are not gambling.""

EA has also come under fire from fans who paid roughly $60 to buy the game, only to find that optional costs built into the game can cost hundreds more. The game essentially gives players a choice. They can spend a huge number of hours collecting in-game credits to unlock new features and cooler characters, or pay real money to get them instantly. In the gaming world, this is called ""pay to win."" It's not unusual, but the format has typically been used in mobile games that are free to download.

And that only comes through conversation and talking with people."" In Webster City, with a population of 8,000, residents live by an ethos known locally as ""Iowa nice."" Despite its charm, the town has had a tough few years. In March 2011, appliance manufacturer Electrolux moved its washer and dryer factory to Mexico -- taking 2,300 jobs with it. The impact was severe. ""People were moving away and businesses were closing,"" said Jeff Pingel, a former Electrolux employee. ""You could feel it. It was just devastating to people."" Former Electrolux union leader Jerry Kloberdanz said the closure made the community fear not being able to make ends meet. ""I honestly thought I would not get another job making over $10 an hour,"" Kloberdanz said. But in recent years, Webster City started to turn around. Small business owners began adopting tech tools like Square to cater to travelers passing through town often without cash.

"It's in such demand that cities including Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Fort Lauderdale, Florida have unveiled test programs that rethink this precious resource. The cities are replacing commercial parking spots with reserved pickup and dropoff areas for Uber and Lyft. It's a part of a larger effort to improve safety and address issues, such as double-parking, blocked bike lanes and impeded transit lanes. The rising popularity of ride-sharing services, e-commerce deliveries and bikeshare networks has triggered cities to reassess how to manage curbspace, according to experts. ""I've noticed this conversation starting to emerge rapidly in most of the large cities where we operate,"" Emily Castor, senior director of transportation policy at Lyft, told CNN Tech. Gerry Tierney, director of the mobility research lab at design firm Perkins+Will, believes most cities will have reserved pick-up and drop-off spots in dense downtown areas in the next few years. ""The Wild West of pick you up anywhere and drop you off anywhere is over,"" Tierney told CNN Tech. ""It's total common sense that we designate these areas."" Although cities sometimes have strained relationships with ridesharing companies, there's incentive for both to find common ground over better use of public space. ""There's a lot of benefits to getting this right -- not just for the people who use our service, but for overall transportation on the streets,"" Andrew Salzberg, Uber's head of transportation policy and research told CNN Tech. ""When there's not sufficient space for these connections to happen, there can be some negative spillover."" Related: Dashcams are helping rideshare drivers boost their pay Last week, San Francisco announced plans for a pilot that would designate dropoff zones for ridesharing services in a popular commercial corridor. Bicycling advocacy organizations in San Francisco, as well as Washington D.C., have been receptive to tests amid concerns about blocked bike lanes. According to Brian Wiedenmeier, executive director at the?San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, the city's popular bike route on Valencia Street has become unpleasant due to ride-sharing growth. Meanwhile, Uber recently worked with local government in Fort Lauderdale to identify hotspots for pick-ups and dropoffs on Las Olas Boulevard, a lively area with nightlife and dining. After Thanksgiving, the city will launch a six-month pilot project that converts 18 parking spots in three areas into designated pickup and dropoff zones during high-traffic hours, weekday nights and weekends. Following an initial grace period, drivers who do not use the zones may be fined. Washington, D.C. is testing a similar approach near DuPont Circle, a popular nightlife destination. The ridesharing companies recommended specific sections of the neighborhood for drop areas. On weekend evenings, the city has replaced 61 parking spaces with reserved zones. There's incentives for drivers, too. ""When you get into the heart of the city, passengers often want to be dropped off or picked up in illegal and sometimes dangerous places,"" said Harry Campbell, editor of TheRideShareGuy.com, a blog for drivers. He calls handling pick-ups and dropoffs the most challenging part about being a driver. But the trend of pickup and dropoff zones is so new that there are no clear best practices yet. Cities are expecting to learn from the trials and improve accordingly. One open question is whether ridesharing companies will have to pay to access the zones. According to Catherine Prince, Fort Lauderdale's mobility project manager, to scale these zones around the city, some form of compensation would be needed to account for lost parking revenue. The city relies on that revenue to fund projects. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, negotiations are ongoing between the government and the ridesharing companies to finalize an agreement. The arrangements with cities may also set the stage for self-driving taxis, which will likely need reserved, curbside spots to effectively meet customers. ""This is sort of like a beta test for autonomous vehicles, when people will summon cars on demand,"" Tierney said. ""You have to first make sure the ridesharing works effectively with transit, bus, bike lanes and everyone using the street."""
"Jurvetson, a partner at prominent VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, is a board member and investor at Tesla and SpaceX. Jurvetson, 50, tweeted about his departure citing ""personal matters, including taking legal action against those whose false statements have defamed me."" Three weeks ago, DFJ confirmed that it was investigating Jurvetson on October 25. ""Earlier this summer we became aware of indirect and second-hand allegations about one partner, Steve Jurvetson,"" read a statement from the company at the time. ""We immediately opened an independent investigation, which is ongoing at this time."" The company didn't provide details on the accusations of misconduct. On Monday, DFJ said in a statement that Jurvetson is leaving the firm ""as of today and by mutual agreement.""

"A group associated with a Gates investment company has invested $80 million in a high-tech planned development outside Phoenix. The community in Belmont will be designed around high-speed networks, autonomous vehicles, high-speed digital networks, data centers, new manufacturing technologies and autonomous logistics hubs. It's unclear how much former Microsoft CEO Gates, who owns Belmont's parent company Cascade Investment, will be involved in the effort. Belmont Partners, the Arizona-based real investment group that's leading the project, said it will be similar in size to nearby Tempe, Arizona, which has a population of 182,000. ""Envisioning future infrastructure from scratch is far easier and more cost efficient than retrofitting an existing urban fabric,"" Grady Gammage, a spokesman for the venture said in the statement. Arizona has a reputation as being a technology-friendly state. Several major players in the autonomous vehicle industry -- Waymo, Uber and Intel -- are testing their innovations in the state. The investment is the latest example of excitement surrounding rebuilding cities from the ground up with a digital mind-set. Related: Saudia Arabia wants to build a $500 billion mega-city spanning three countries But developing a new city or even a neighborhood isn't cheap. This October Sidewalk Labs, the urban innovation arm of Google's parent company Alphabet, committed $50 million for the initial phase of planning and pilot testing a Toronto neighborhood development. It's designed as a model neighborhood for the 21st century, with reduced pollution, shortened commutes, safer streets and better weather. Transportation will be designed around shared electric vehicles, walking and biking. More flexible zoning will blend commercial, industrial and residential areas. Only a week later after the Toronto announcement, Saudia Arabia announced plans to invest $500 billion in a new global hub meant to push the boundaries of innovation and exemplify the future of civilization. The smart cities trend has gained momentum as Silicon Valley's disruptors shift their focus to transportation innovations such as autonomous vehicles and ridesharing services. Belmont's developers are counting on the expected development of Interstate 11, which will serve the area, to boost development. But right now, the company is not rushing to move forward. ""This is a very long term, very patient investment,"" Gammage told CNN Tech."
"Technology has evolved a lot since then, but closets have been largely untouched by innovation. Now, that's starting to change. ""If algorithms do their job well, people will spend less time thinking about what to wear,"" said Ranjitha Kumar, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. From artificial intelligence and gadgets to smart fabrics and virtual reality, technology is poised to breathe innovation into not only how we dress but how we shop. The most recognizable example is Amazon's Echo Look, which received significant buzz when it was announced earlier this year. The gadget ($200) serves as a style assistant to help you decide what to wear.  Like Amazon's other smart speakers, the Echo Look will tell you the weather or play music. But the oval-shaped product also has a voice-controlled camera for taking photos of you in various outfits. It works alongside an app. Related: Amazon's $200 Echo Look will judge your outfits After snapping photos of you in two outfits in front of the device, its built-in Style Check tool decides which one is best. It leans on a combination of machine learning technology and human opinion. Amazon's ""fashion specialists"" train the software to be a judge of style. The automated results consider ""fit, color, styling, seasons and current trends."" It'll also suggest similar styles to buy from various brands. Through testing, we found that the suggestions can be hit or miss. ""The brand selection is pretty limited, and while the Echo Look may help you decide between two looks, it can't take into account the total context of where you're going,"" said personal stylist and creative director Taylor Okata. Okata, whose clients include E! and SELF Magazine, doesn't consider the technology a threat to his work: ""There's just that interpersonal communication that it just doesn't have."" Meanwhile, retail experts say the Echo Look's success will depend on if it adds more value than just asking a friend for fashion advice. Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at research firm Forrester, said those buying the device are early adopters -- and it lacks widespread appeal. ""It's such a foreign concept to rely on a device to tell you what to wear,"" she told CNN Tech. Related: New app backed by Kim Kardashian wants to be fashion's Shazam Other companies are embracing augmented and virtual reality to help people decide what to wear. For example, Obsess VR builds augmented and virtual reality shopping platforms so customers can shop without having to go to a store. In July, the company partnered with Vera Bradley to roll out VR experiences at 10 of its stores. While wearing a Google Daydream VR headset, shoppers can move a bed around in VR, and see Vera Bradley comforters, quilts and pillows up close in a virtual store. ""If you think about e-commerce, every brand and every product essentially looks the same online,"" said Obsess CEO and founder Neha Singh. ""It's identical looking, white background product shots, and that doesn't encapsulate what the brand is about. We are building the technology that will enable any brand and retailer to create discovery-based shopping experiences."" Apple's new augmented reality platform builds on a similar concept, allowing developers to create augmented reality apps. For example, the new IKEA Place app lets users preview furniture virtually within their home. The tool has more widespread appeal because it doesn't require a headset. Fabrics are getting smarter, too. Earlier this year, JanSport unveiled a prototype for a high-tech backpack with programmable fabric. The backpack lets users share a song, music video, Facebook page or website link with anyone nearby by holding up their smartphone and using a corresponding app. The backpack could give teens a new way to express themselves. The concept comes from MIT professor Yoel Fink, the CEO of Advanced Functional Fabrics of America, a nonprofit that aims to reinvent fabrics as programmable devices.  ""Fabrics are among the earliest forms of human expression and they've been around for thousands of years,"" Fink said. ""But they really haven't changed much from a functional perspective. Our goal is to change what fabrics [do]."" The team's latest prototype is a sports jersey that would let spectators at a game scan an app over players to see their stats, such as rebounds, assists and points. The group will soon test the new jerseys with the MIT basketball team. Related: JanSport's high-tech backpack shares your social media Artificial intelligence could also have a big impact on style, especially as a tool to help retailers predict trends and keep fashion houses ahead of the curve. Researchers are already working on such solutions using AI and machine learning. For example, Kumar from the University of Illinois and her team are looking at algorithmically identifying fashion ""influencers"" and emerging trends. Using machine learning techniques that analyze the content of tweets, the group has identified more than 27,000 fashion-related accounts on Twitter as the top trendsetters. ""We're now tracking these influencers and the content they post to model micro-trends and predict their lifetime,"" she said. However, the challenge is the speed at which fashion trends change. They can go in weeks or sometimes even a few days, according to Kumar. Kavita Bala, a professor in the Computer Science Department at Cornell University, is also analyzing social media platforms to look for fashion trends. For example, her team can plot how often people are wearing a certain clothing item over time for a particular city in the world. But Bala said style recommendation presents another challenge: ""People have very distinctive, subtle and individualist style and they're very picky about it."" While some AI approaches are already in the works, other tech, like shopping with a VR headset in your home, is still years away. It's also unclear how quickly consumers would adopt this. ""All of that is becoming possible, but we're not quite there yet,"" said Obsess' Singh."
"The ride-hailing startup said Sunday that it has reached an agreement for what could be a massive investment from SoftBank (SFTBF), the Japanese conglomerate, after months of speculation about a possible deal. ""We've entered into an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and Dragoneer on a potential investment,"" Uber said in a statement Sunday. ""We believe this agreement is a strong vote of confidence in Uber's long-term potential."" Uber did not provide an update on the size and structure of the agreement, but a source familiar with the matter said it was essentially unchanged from earlier reports. CNNMoney reported last month that SoftBank was looking to invest around $1 billion in Uber at its current $69 billion valuation. SoftBank is also expected to invest billions more buying up shares from existing shareholders at a discounted rate, depending on demand from sellers. SoftBank, however, struck a sharper tone in a statement released Monday. Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisors, said Uber had agreed to move forward with the investment ""after a long and arduous process,"" but stressed that a final deal is contingent on getting enough Uber insiders to sell their stakes at the right price. ""By no means is our investment decided,"" Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisors and a Board Director of SoftBank Group Corp, said in a statement provided to CNNMoney. ""We are interested in Uber but the final deal will depend on the tender price and a minimum percentage shareholding for SoftBank."" SoftBank is said to want at least a 14% ownership stake in Uber. Otherwise, it could walk away from the deal. The dueling statements are just the latest example of SoftBank publicly needling Uber over a multi-billion dollar deal months in the making. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has repeatedly teased the possibility -- some might say threat -- of investing in Lyft instead, including as recently as this month. The stakes are high for Uber. If the deal falls apart, SoftBank's money could make its way to its chief U.S. rival, just weeks after Lyft announced a $1 billion investment led by Google (GOOGL, Tech30)'s parent company. If the SoftBank deal goes through, it would function like a mini-IPO that helps tide Uber over until it actually goes public in 2019 as planned. Employees and investors would have an opportunity to cash out some of their stakes in the company, potentially boosting morale after a punishing year full of executive shuffles and PR crises. Uber would also get a cash infusion as it fights a resurgent Lyft in its backyard and increasingly well-funded competitors abroad, not to mention the looming financial risk posed by lawsuits and disputes over driver benefits. Uber had $6.6 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, but continues to bleed hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter. Related: SoftBank: The new kingmaker in tech The SoftBank investment isn't just about the money, however. It's also key to reforming Uber's dysfunctional board and bringing a detente between warring factions: former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and early Uber investor Benchmark. As part of the agreement, Kalanick has agreed that he cannot fill the three board seats he controls in the future without majority approval by the board, according to two people familiar with the matter. Kalanick blindsided Uber in September by appointing two new members without notice. Benchmark, in return, has agreed to put on hold its lawsuit against Kalanick over his control of the three board seats, with plans to drop the case if and when the SoftBank deal closes, according to the sources. The case had been set to go to arbitration. To pave the way for the deal, Uber previously agreed to add six new seats to its board, two of which will go to SoftBank. Uber's board also adopted a new voting system that will further lessen Kalanick's influence. ""Upon closing, it will help fuel our investments in technology and our continued expansion at home and abroad, while strengthening our corporate governance,"" Uber said of the deal in its statement. SoftBank publicly expressed interest about investing in Uber over the summer, while the startup was still looking for a CEO to replace Kalanick after months of operating with a mostly empty C-suite. Related: Ousted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick shakes up board of directors At an event last week, Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, admitted it had taken a long time to get Uber's board on the same page for the SoftBank deal, but expressed confidence in getting it done. ""There's negotiations going on,"" he said. ""They've probably taken longer than they should have, but we're gonna get there. Because all the parties, in the end, they know this is a good direction.""

"""Do we have enough women on our board of directors? Do we have enough women in our management team? Do we have enough women in middle management? The answer is generally no, we don't,"" Benioff said in a new podcast episode of CNN's Boss Files with Poppy Harlow. The cloud computing company has spent $6 million trying to close its gender and racial pay gaps. Benioff, who has publicly advocated for equality in technology, has also invested in Bay Area public schools and hospitals. But he admits that work doesn't let him off the hook from doing more. He sat down with Harlow on Tuesday, November at Dreamforce, his company's annual conference in San Francisco, to talk diversity, equality and gender.  Leading on diversity Silicon Valley has struggled with diversity for years. Facebook, Apple and Google all release transparency reports about the women and underrepresented minorities in their workforces. They also invest big in computer science education, and they employ people who focus on diversity. But many still struggle to hire and keep a diverse workforce. Salesforce's approach has been aggressive. Last year it spent $3 million to close the gender pay gap. This year the company checked for differences in pay based on race and gender. It spent another $3 million to raise pay for 11% of its 26,000 employees. It plans on checking for differences regularly. ""We take this seriously because people are looking to us as an example and as a role model,"" Benioff said in the new podcast episode. He added that he was ""quite embarrassed"" by some findings. In addition to addressing pay issues, Salesforce is turning to employee resource groups to help diversity its ranks. 'Deeply concerned' about the future of technology The promise of technology is often that it will help fix our problems. But Benioff said he thinks we should be more critical of those promises. Artificial intelligence, robotics, self-driving cars and nanotechnology are altering our society, he said. ""But we have to ask ourselves a question, which is, are we creating more equality in the world through these technologies, or are we creating more inequality?"" Benioff said. Automation, for example, will drastically change employment and require job retraining. We will have to be proactive about making sure that everyone is trained for new jobs and that women aren't left behind, warns Benioff. ""I am deeply concerned that we are at a precipice right now,"" he said. ""We are at a point where we need to make these decisions. We need to decide what kind of a society that we're gonna have going forward."" Harassment in Silicon Valley The crackdown on sexual harassment is also key to ensuring workplace equality, Benioff said. The allegations made against film producer Harvey Weinstein have been a catalyst for such discussions in recent weeks. But Silicon Valley has had its own problems with harassment. Benioff said some harassment allegations have been ""shocking"" to him. He said he hasn't seen any similarly extreme examples himself, but had heard about recent allegations about investors. Related: Money, power and sexual harassment ""I always think I'm a little bit naive, honestly, that I'm not aware of some of those things,"" he added. ""But when I heard some of those stories ¡ª it's horrible and it's deeply upsetting to me."" He said employing women at all levels is how he hopes to avoid harassment at Salesforce. ""If people think that it's okay, well then behavior can get out of control and you see that,"" Benioff said. ""I've seen it in a lot of companies and certainly companies that I've worked in. That isn't the kind of company we want at Salesforce. We want a company that is focused on gender equality."" He's not running for office Technology CEOs often act as if they are toying with political ambitions. Their products are marketed as world changing. Many executives are active philanthropists. Some make even more curious decisions. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, for example, is visiting every state in the U.S. to connect with regular people, and he even hired a political campaign manager to work with policy and advocacy. Benioff didn't mention running for office. Instead, he said he's more comfortable using his CEO platform to change the world. ""If somebody all of a sudden starts to talk about these issues that are so important to us ¡ª like education, like equality, and the environment ¡ª we shouldn't all of a sudden say, 'Are you gonna be a political figure?'"" he said. ""If we delegate these things to political figures, they're not gonna get done."" Benioff argued that the onus is on all of us. ""I don't expect politicians to change the world,"" he said. ""I expect all of us to change the world."""
"On Monday, the ride-hailing company announced it will begin operating in Toronto, starting in December. ""We have had our sights set on international expansion for months, and the Canadian market is an obvious fit for Lyft's culture, values and the service that we provide,"" Lyft CEO Logan Green said in a statement to CNN Tech. ""We've had incredible interest from both drivers and passengers in Toronto."" Previously, Lyft operated internationally through partnerships with local ride-sharing companies, like Grab in Southeast Asia and Didi in China. Related: Lyft shows just how serious it is about self-driving cars ""Lyft is a little late to the [international] game, but enjoys a better public image [than Uber], which I expect will ease their expansion efforts,"" said Carl Doty, vice president and group director at research firm Forrester. ""There is some pretty high, positive sentiment with Lyft,"" he added. ""They are playing this slow and steady wins the race game."" The move comes as its competitor Uber continues to face challenges abroad. The company is appealing London's decision to pull its license after the city's transport authority said Uber was not ""fit and proper"" to operate there. Uber also considered pulling out of Quebec. The company was operating in the Canadian province under a government pilot project, which was renewed with stricter requirement. For example, Quebec wants drivers to complete 35 hours of training, which Uber said was not feasible for many of its drivers who have other jobs and only drive for the service part-time. But last month, the company said it would continue to operate in Quebec for now and hopes to negotiate with the new transport minister about the new regulations. Uber already operates in Toronto. Last month, Lyft announced a $1 billion investment round led by Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30)."
"Oh, and it also might fly. ""Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe..."" Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tweeted Sunday. Musk had been Tweeting about a ""special option package"" for the Tesla Roadster that ""takes it to the next level."" He implied that the 1.9-second zero-to-60 times, which already beats the quickest cars now available by nearly half a second, could be improved upon with a future upgrade. ""Just a question of safety,"" Musk said of the possible flight option. ""Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities."" Musk is also CEO of the rocket company SpaceX, although the enormous rockets SpaceX makes would obviously be very different from ones that would launch a car off the pavement. A number of companies are working on ""flying cars"" which, for the most part, amount to road-worthy airplanes that could legally be driven on streets. Musk seems to be talking about something different, a sports car that could ""hop"" over obstacles. The emphasis would, presumably, still be on performance and practicality with four wheels on the ground. The Roadster was revealed as a surprise addition during the same Thursday night event at which Tesla unveiled its electric semi-truck."
"The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) fined Uber $8.9 million on Monday for allowing drivers with ""disqualifying"" criminal or motor vehicle offenses to drive for the company. Some of them did not have valid licenses and others used fake names, the PUC revealed. In one case, the company hired a driver in Colorado who was previously an escaped felon. He passed a background check by using an alias. Related: What we know (and don't know) about Uber background checks In a notice issued by the commission, there were violations listed for 57 Uber drivers over the last year and a half who shouldn't have passed a background check, PUC said. Uber was fined $2,500 per day for each day a disqualified driver worked. Earlier this year, the commission's staff began an investigation after the Vail Police Department notified them about an Uber driver accused of assaulting a rider. When comparing records provided by Uber to information from court databases, PUC staff found Uber had approved drivers with previous felony convictions, major moving violations such as DUIs and reckless driving, and found ""numerous instances"" of people driving with suspended, revoked or cancelled driver's licenses. ""We have determined that Uber had background check information that should have disqualified these drivers under the law, but they were allowed to drive anyway,"" PUC director Doug Dean said in a statement. ""These actions put the safety of passengers in extreme jeopardy."" Related: More than 8,000 Uber and Lyft drivers fail Massachusetts background check Uber said it was made aware of the fine when PUC published its press release. ""We recently discovered a process error that was inconsistent with Colorado's ridesharing regulations and proactively notified the Colorado Public Utilities Commission,"" an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement to CNN Tech. ""This error affected a small number of drivers and we immediately took corrective action."" Uber has over 13,000 active drivers in Colorado. Uber mostly conducts digital background checks via a startup called Checkr. The startup screens applicants by using Social Security numbers to identify associated addresses. It then reviews driving and criminal histories in national, state and local databases. Those databases include the U.S. Department of Justice National Sex Offender Public Website and ones that flag suspected terrorists. Checkr is bound by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law that regulates how reporting agencies use a person's information. However, a source familiar with Checkr previously told CNN Tech that Uber makes the final decision on whether to hire a driver based on Checkr's screening results. Uber said Colorado's laws are different from ride-sharing laws in other states. For example, a driver convicted of a felony for crimes such as trespassing or forgery would not be allowed to drive with Uber or another ride-sharing company in Colorado. Colorado's investigation found that 12 Uber drivers had felony convictions; 17 had major moving vehicle violations; 63 had driver's license issues and three had interlock driver's licenses, which are needed after recent drunk driving convictions. An ignition Interlock is a device installed in a car that requires a breath sample before the engine can start."
"But when Google (GOOG) announced its new Pixel Buds in October, touting the ability to translate a conversation between different languages in near real time, it promised something unique. With over 7,000 languages spoken around the world, the ease of wiping away language barriers with technology has obvious allure. Travelers could visit any country and instantly talk to locals. It could help displaced populations connect with new communities. Jobs would become accessible to more people worldwide. But the Pixel Buds don't fulfill that promise, at least not yet. The $159 Bluetooth earbuds work with recent Android and iOS devices, but the translation feature is specific to Google Pixel smartphones. Without a Pixel phone, you're getting somewhat uncomfortable wireless headphones with decent sound quality and a hefty price tag. To use the instant translate feature, put on the headphones, press and hold the right bud, and say, ""Help me speak Italian."" It fires up the Google Translate app, and you hand your smartphone to the other person. While wearing the earbuds, you can say a phrase, such as ""I love your hat. Where did you get it?"" The Pixel phone will then translate the phrase out loud in Italian using its built-in Google Assistant. The other person can press the microphone button on the Pixel phone to speak a response in Italian. You'll hear the English translation via the ear buds. Related: Google's Pixelbook is a pretty ad for Chromebooks Since it launched over 11 years ago, the free Google Translate site and app has grown to include more than 100 languages. But only 40 are currently supported by Pixel Buds. The usual caveats of using a machine translation tool to communicate with someone still apply. The results are typically close enough to make a conversation possible, if you speak in clear sentences, don't ramble, and avoid idioms. (That's probably good advice for all conversations.) Translations happen fast, but background noise was a problem. The Pixel Buds sometimes prematurely thought I was done talking. The app shows the written translation on the phone screen -- a helpful feature. But overall, the technology is not yet fluid enough to have long, deep conversations about politics, business or the meaning of life. You will definitely be able to find the nearest restroom. The two black earbuds are connected to each other by a cord. I prefer the cord to Apple's free-floating EarPods, but some people may find it to be too bulky. The adjustable loop of cord kept the Pixel Buds in place, but the plastic buds themselves didn't fit comfortably into my ears. Because ears are not all the same shape, an earbud that's uncomfortable for one person may fit perfectly for another. Google's earbuds come in an attractive fabric case that doubles as a charging dock. The earpieces don't click into place as easily as they should, and you have to wind the cable around them each time, leaving a loop hanging out. Apple's EarPods win on compact packaging and charging. For Pixel phone owners interested in translation, the Pixel Buds are unquestionably a fun option, but they're not ready for professional level tasks. If you only want them to listen to music and podcasts, there are cheaper options available with similar or better sound quality. In the end, it's not worth buying a Pixel phone specifically to get the Pixel Buds. After all, anyone can download the free Google Translate app on Android or iOS and get a similar experience."
"The ride-hailing giant is rolling out new tools such as a live location feature and windshield colors. The efforts intend to improve the pick-up process, especially in crowded areas like the airport or a concert venue. ""The rendezvous point between rider and driver is one of the most stress inducing parts [of the trip]. Often times you're on the street, it might be cold, you're looking around. It could be dark,"" Uber product lead Nundu Janakiram told CNN Tech. ""Riders kept telling us that they were basically trying to verbally [describe] their GPS point."" Related: Uber now lets you add multiple stops to your ride Location sharing is an optional feature you must turn on in an effort to address privacy concerns. Following an outcry earlier this year, Uber turned off a tool that allowed the company to track customers' locations even after their trip was over.

""Many people can see the usefulness of this [new] feature, but want to be in control. That was a critical design principle."" Even cities, which have often clashed with ride-sharing services, want to make it easier for riders to find their drivers. For example, San Francisco and Washington D.C. are currently testing designated pick-up and drop-off areas for both Uber and Lyft. The move intends to improve safety and address other issues such as double-parking and blocked bike lanes. Related: Uber is (finally) rolling out tipping Uber also announced on Monday that riders can identify a driver's location by looking for a device called a Beacon on the car's windshield.

Uber continues its new features spree aimed at improving customer and driver experiences, following a series of PR crises this year. The company recently added multiple stops to trips, the ability to tip drivers and an in-app messaging for drivers and riders."
"The ride-hailing company has agreed to buy ""tens of thousands"" of cars from the Swedish automaker, the companies announced Monday. The framework agreement, which isn't exclusive, runs from 2019 to 2021. The Wall Street Journal reported that such a deal could be worth an estimated $1 billion. Volvo said it would sell Uber XC90 premium SUVs as ""base vehicles"" for the autonomous car project. Uber would not share financial information about the project, and Volvo did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. It's a significant move forward for what has already been a longstanding partnership between the two companies. Last year, they announced a $300 million project to jointly develop autonomous cars.

An expansion to parts of California ran into trouble when state regulators dinged the test vehicles for not having the proper permits. Sarah Abboud, an Uber spokeswoman, said the Volvo prototype vehicles were not built for scale manufacturing or true autonomy -- the step that removes a driver from the car completely. She said the new agreement puts Uber on the path toward rolling out mass-produced autonomous cars at scale. The use of autonomous cars is widely seen as critical for the future of Uber's business. Automakers like Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F) and GM (GM) are also toying with autonomous cars and ride services.

"British startup bio-bean has partnered with Shell (RDSB) and Argent Energy to create a coffee-based biofuel that will be used in London's diesel buses. The company has produced 6,000 liters of coffee oil for the pilot project with London's transportation authority -- enough to help power the equivalent of one city bus for a year. ""It's a great example of what can be done when we start to reimagine waste as an untapped resource,"" bio-bean founder Arthur Kay said in a statement. The startup collects used coffee grounds from cafes, restaurants and factories, and transports them to its recycling facility. There, the grounds are dried before coffee oil is extracted. The coffee oil is then blended with other fuels to create B20 biofuel, which can be used in diesel buses without modification. ""Spent coffee grounds are highly calorific and contain valuable compounds, making them an ideal feedstock from which to produce clean fuels,"" the company says on its website.  Bio-bean estimates that Britain produces 500,000 tonnes of coffee grounds a year, most of which are discarded in landfills where they can emit harmful greenhouse gases. The company also sells ""coffee logs,"" which are used in fireplaces and stoves as an alternative to wooden logs. Related: Tiffany's opens first-ever cafe Bio-bean said there is ""no formal agreement"" to continue using its coffee oil in London, but it hopes to quickly find new markets and applications.

"Chinese tech giant Tencent (TCEHY) has announced plans to distribute PlayerUnknown's ""Battlegrounds"" in its home market after modifying the violent game to comply with ""socialist core values."" The game, which was developed by South Korea's Bluehole Studio, has attracted 20 million global players since its debut in March. But its chance of approval in China took a hit in October when state censors described it as ""too bloody and violent"" and contrary to ""traditional Chinese culture."" In the game, players deploy a variety of weapons in fight-to-the-death scenarios reminiscent of Hollywood movie series ""The Hunger Games."" But the version that goes on sale in China could be toned down significantly. Tencent pledged in its statement to bring the game's content ""in line with the socialist core values and ... the traditional cultural norms and ethics of the Chinese nation."" Tencent and Bluehole didn't respond when asked exactly how the game would be changed, or when it would officially debut in China on PC.

"Schneiderman said that his office believed the identities of Americans were stolen and used to submit comments on net neutrality to the FCC. ""This is akin to identity theft on a massive scale,"" he said. People were invited to submit their views on net neutrality to the FCC earlier this year. The current net neutrality rules, approved during the Obama administration, barred internet providers from deliberately speeding up or slowing down traffic to or from specific websites and apps. Under new rules proposed by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, internet providers would be allowed to prioritize content but would need to publicly disclose they are doing so. Related: Trump FCC chair unveils plan to repeal net neutrality More than 20 million comments were submitted -- but Schneiderman says many of them are fake. The FCC does not require commenters to verify their identity, and features on the FCC website allow multiple comments to be uploaded from the same computer at once. Last week, Schneiderman's office unveiled an online tool that helped people see if their names had been used without their knowledge on comments submitted to the FCC. By Monday, Schneiderman said, they had received more than 3,000 responses -- including, he said, from a man who said his deceased mother's name had been used. The identity of one of Schneiderman's staff members was also used without her permission, he said. ""The slowdown in investment is destroying jobs and risks a big future tax hike to make up for lost private investment. Save American jobs by repealing Net Neutrality,"" the comment, which used the staffer's name and childhood address in Rhode Island, said. The same language was also used in other comments submitted to the FCC under other people's names. Jessica Rosenworcel, one of two Democratic commissioners currently on the FCC, also called for the vote to be delayed pending a full investigation. ""The FCC is on course to eliminate net neutrality guided by a record corrupted by hundreds of thousands of filings with stolen identities,"" Rosenworcel said. Schneiderman did not specify if the comments his office identified as fake were primarily in support of or against the current net neutrality rules. Separate independent studies also found high levels of suspected fake comments. The Pew Research Center found that 57% of comments submitted to the FCC regarding the upcoming net neutrality vote used temporary or duplicate email addresses. A report commissioned by Broadband for America, which is backed by major telecommunications companies including AT&T and Comcast, found that the vast majority of personalized or unique comments -- that is, the comments least likely to have been faked -- were in favor of the current net neutrality rules. (AT&T is in the process of acquiring Time Warner, CNN's parent company.) The study found 1.52 million comments with language that only appeared once in the FCC database in favor of the current rules, and only 23,000 against. ""Presumably, these comments originated from individuals that took the time to type a personalized comment. Although these comments represent less than 10% of the total, this is a notable difference,"" the report said. Separately Monday, more than two dozen Democratic senators also wrote to the FCC calling for the December 14 vote to be delayed until a review of the submissions take place. Citing the findings of Schneiderman's office and other researchers, the senators wrote, ""These reports raise serious concerns as to whether the record the FCC is currently relying on has been tampered with and merits the full attention of, and investigation by, the FCC before votes on this item are cast."" At a press conference Monday, Schneiderman said the FCC had for months had been unwilling to provide records necessary to investigate the alleged fake comments further, but that on Monday the FCC indicated that it would assist with the investigation. A spokesperson for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican who backs overturning the current rules, said in response to Schneiderman's comments on Monday, ""This is an attempt by people who want to keep the Obama Administration's heavy-handed Internet regulations to delay the vote because they realize that their effort to defeat the plan to restore Internet freedom has stalled."" The spokesperson said that Schneiderman had not identified as fake any comments that were used as part of Pai's proposal."
"The Facebook (FB, Tech30)-owned company announced it is adding content warnings to selfies that include wildlife, such as tigers and koalas, when certain hashtags are used. Dedicated social media posters aren't typically trekking into jungles and posing next to wild animals. Most take the photos at tourist attractions that offer up captive animals as props, including tigers, lions, koalas, and dolphins. Wildlife conservation groups say these centers often mistreat the animals, and that the daily contact with humans can be traumatic. ""To better educate our community members about creating content that exploits wildlife and nature, today we are launching new in-app products to encourage everyone to be thoughtful about interactions with wild animals and the environment,"" the company said in a statement. If you click on an offending hashtag like #koalaselfie, #lionselfie #koalahugs or #tigerpet, a new warning will pop up. You can go ahead and view the photos, cancel your search, or learn more from an Instagram help page. ""You are searching for a hashtag that may be associated with posts that encourage harmful behavior to animals or the environment,"" the warning reads. Instagram is not the first social site to wade into the tiger-selfie debate. In July, dating app Tinder asked users not to use selfies with tigers in their profiles, at the urging of PETA. ""Posing next to a king of the jungle doesn't make you one,"" said Tinder in a post at the time. Like Tinder, Instagram isn't banning the photos or taking the selfies down. The hashtags still auto-populate in search results. However the company says it does remove images that depict animal abuse or the sale of endangered animals. It's working with a number of organizations including the World Wildlife Fund and Traffic on enforcement. #KoalaSelfie ????

"Shares in the British-German tech company plunged 23% on Monday, after it acknowledged that Apple (AAPL, Tech30) -- by far its biggest customer -- can now develop the power management chips Dialog produces. Dialog shares had already slumped in April on fears that Apple could drop the company as a supplier, and Monday's crash took the stock's losses this year to more than 40%. The company has previously tried to play down those concerns. Monday was the first time it has publicly acknowledged Apple could eventually replace its chips with in-house production. ""Dialog recognizes Apple has the resources and capability to internally design a [power management integrated circuit] and could potentially do so in the next few years,"" the company said in a statement. A lot is at stake. Apple accounted for 74% of Dialog's sales in 2016, according to the company's annual report. ""This is a major disaster,"" said Tim Wunderlich, analyst at Hauck & Aufhauser. ""I would expect Dialog to experience declining sales from 2019 onward, intensifying gross margin pressure, (and) brain drain as uncertainties make the company a far less appealing employer for top talent,"" he added. Related: Apple files for flip phone patent The Nikkei Asian Review reported last week that Apple could start using its own power management chips as early as next year. Dialog said it had no information to suggest Apple was getting ready to start making its own chips that soon. It is working with Apple on plans for 2019 products, and will have a better idea about its future contracts with Apple by March, the company added. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Another company, Imagination Technologies, (IGNMF) saw its stock drop more than 70% in April, after Apple said it was planning to stop licensing the firm's technology in about two years. Imagination has since been sold to China-backed Canyon Bridge Capital Partners for ?550 million ($740 million), well below the ?2 billion ($2.7 billion) it was worth at its peak in 2012."
"The social network on Monday announced a new standalone app called Messenger Kids. It targets children ages six to 12. The app allows young users to chat with their friends, make video calls with kid-friendly filters and send age-appropriate GIFs. While this may sounds like a parent's worst nightmare, Facebook said it put safeguards in place to keep the platform safe and private. Parents must set up a child's Messenger Kids account and approve with whom they can communicate (parents must be friends on Facebook to do so). Kids will not be searchable within the app for privacy reasons. ""Safety is absolutely the most important concern [and] being able to [know] who they're using the device with,"" Loredana Crisan, Facebook Messenger's product design director, told CNN Tech. ""The ability to connect with only approved contacts is very important for that age range."" Children will not be able to access their parent's Facebook account and won't have their own account. Facebook's policy still requires users to be at least 13 years old to sign up for the main site. The company said it will collect ""little data"" about its young users and will not feature ads or in-app purchases. It will also include tools to report or flag inappropriate content and block users. Related: Google cracks down on disturbing cartoons on YouTube Kids Facebook said it worked with a committee of about a dozen experts and more than 250 online safety organizations to develop the app. It also met with parents across the U.S. to hear the major concerns about their kids using technology. The biggest theme? Parents want more control -- and Messenger Kids is Facebook's answer. According to research conducted by Facebook and consultant firm Dubit, about 90% of kids between ages six to 12 have access to tablets or smartphones. Meanwhile, two out of three of those children have a device of their own. Facebook argued putting communication in a place that can be monitored by parents allows kids to connect with friends and family online in a fun, but controlled way. It's also a part of Facebook's larger strategy to grow its 2 billion user base.  But the app will likely draw some criticism. ""American parents are really protective of their young kids' privacy and social interactions,"" said Jenny Radesky, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. ""There will probably be a bit of reaction that they're too young and there's a [general] lack of interest for [messaging apps]."" The young age requirement could also be a concern. ""As a parent, I would not be interested in a messaging product for my kids,"" Radesky said. ""Do children really need that yet? You can get a lot of those modalities elsewhere."" She pointed to video-chatting services like Skype and FaceTime. Related: 11 hottest toys for this holiday season Facebook isn't the first to create a chat app made for kids. In 2013, Snapchat (SNAP) launched a version of its disappearing photo platform for kids under 13 called SnapKidz. It was a limited version of its main app and didn't let users send or receive photos or add friends. It has since been discontinued. Snapchat declined to comment why when asked. Other messaging apps for kids under 13 with parental controls have had trouble taking off, too. ""These things only work if everyone else is on it as well,"" said Stephen Balkam, founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute and a member of Facebook's Advisory Committee. ""It's such a crowded marketplace [for apps]."" Facebook could have more success with a kids app considering it is a global brand with a large user base. ""You never know, until you put it out there, how it's going to be used and what unintended consequences there might be from what they created,"" Balkam said. ""But from what I've seen [from Facebook], it does look like an incredibly thoughtful approach."" The preview of Messenger Kids will roll out on iOS in the U.S. on Monday and launch officially by the end of the year. It will come to Android and Kindle in the future."

"Prices for the Roadster will start at $200,000, with a required deposit of $50,000. A limited edition Founders Series of the car will cost $250,000 and will have to be paid for up front and in full. At these prices, someone could buy an Aston Martin DB11 or a Bentley Continental GT. Those cars can't match the Roadster's advertised performance figures -- but there's a lot more to a sports car than just speed. Related: Does Tesla have enough cash to fix Model 3 production woes? The Roadster's ability to go from zero to 60 in under two seconds is unprecedented, and would make this the quickest production car ever. It can run the quarter mile in 8.8 seconds. That's faster than a Dodge Challenger Demon, an 840-horsepower single-seat car designed especially for drag racing. And its top speed of over 250 miles an hour puts it in the same league as the $3 million Bugatti Chiron. That figure is especially surprising, given that top speed is not an area in which electric cars tend to excel. (High speeds mean much more battery-draining wind resistance.) Anyone who can afford to spend a quarter million dollars on a car is used to high level of quality of craftsmanship. That means Tesla needs to overcome the production issues it is currently having with the far simpler Model 3, as well as the sort of quality issues it's been having with the complex Model X. Tesla sued over Model 3 delays Sports cars also need to corner well and give the driver a sense of confidence and control. Tesla's original Roadster, produced from 2008 to 2012, was built on the skeleton of a British Lotus sports car. Lotus is legendary for how well its cars handled, and for an obsession with light weight, which also helps with cornering and control. For a company building a high-end sports car, there could hardly be a better place to start. This Roadster will presumably be all Tesla (TSLA). Electric drive does provide some advantages for a sports car. First, most sports cars have an engine that concentrates weight somewhere in the car. A lot of sports car design is about how to carry that big block of metal through turns at high speeds. Engineers and designers work hard to position the engine as low as possible in the car, and in a place that will give the car stable, controllable and predictable cornering characteristics. Tesla reveals semi-truck and new sports car In an electric car, the weight is concentrated in battery packs, but those batteries don't need to be all together. In Tesla's other vehicles, they're spread out under the floor of the car, giving them a very low center of gravity and weight that's evenly balanced. But, batteries are heavy and weight is still a problem, no matter where it is. That's why electric cars are, generally speaking, heavier than gasoline powered cars. Tesla engineers will still have to overcome, or minimize, the sheer weight that will come with that level of range and performance. Still, based on Tesla's claims, the Roadster certainly the potential to be a big winner for Tesla that could help generate the profits it so badly needs and even more buzz."
"Tesla revealed an all-new version of its Roadster sports car that can go from a stop to 60 miles an hour in 1.9 seconds, a figure that would make it the fastest-accelerating production car ever. That was after Tesla unveiled its new semi-truck, which CEO Elon Musk said can go zero-to-60 in five seconds with an empty trailer. That's a figure usually associated with luxury sedans, not big trucks. With a full load, the truck can still reach that speed in 20 seconds, according to Musk, much faster than any diesel-powered truck. Related: An Elon Musk email from May is making people upset Only after talking about the truck's speed did Musk mention its range. It can go up to 500 miles with a full load at highway speeds, he said. That's more than twice the distance of most trucking routes, Musk claimed, allowing a driver to make a round trip before recharging. A 300-mile version will also be available. But truck drivers may still have some reservations. Regardless of whether Musk is right about the typical length of trucking routes, 500 miles is still far less than diesel trucks can travel. And diesel fuel tanks can be refilled much more quickly than batteries can be recharged The Roadster will have a range of 620 miles and a top speed of over 250 miles an hour. That would put it, at least, near the 261 mile-an-hour top speed of the $3 million Bugatti Chiron. Going into plaid pic.twitter.com/OUU9s7CUwI  The Roadster will also be able to run a quarter mile from stop in 8.8 seconds, Tesla said. For comparison, the 840-horsepower Dodge Challenger Demon, a single-seat car engineered specifically for drag racing, manages it in just under 10 seconds. Unlike the previous version of the Roadster, Tesla's first model which went out of production in 2012, this car will have four seats. The Roadster will cost $200,000 and a $50,000 deposit will be required to reserve one. It is not clear yet what the final price of the truck will be. The semi's drive systems are guaranteed to last for 1 million miles, Tesla said. Thanks to the low cost of running it, buyers should make back the additional cost in just two years, Tesla claimed. Inside the Tesla semi's cab, the driver is seated in the center -- rather than on the left or right -- with a large touch screen on each side. Without a large diesel engine, the driver will have a roomier cab than in other trucks, Tesla said. The truck will also have an enhanced version of Tesla's semi-autonomous driving system, AutoPilot."
"The federal Lifeline program, established in 1985, provides discounted phone and internet service in poorer communities. The FCC expanded the program to include broadband last year, and has given participating households a $9.25 per month credit to use for internet access. Thursday's 3-2 party line vote means one piece of the program will change immediately, and lays the ground work to alter or kill other pieces. The commission will almost immediately limit a $25 extra subsidy for homes situated anywhere on Tribal lands to rural areas only. The benefit is applied on top of the $9.25 subsidy already offered by the program. Related: FCC blocks 9 companies from providing low-income internet access Another proposal still under consideration by the panel includes preventing resellers, or internet providers that don't run their own infrastructure like AT&T or Sprint, from providing Lifeline support, meaning some in the program might not be able to stay with their current provider, or sign up with one at all. The FCC has approved providers for the last two years, but another proposal under consideration would send that approval power to the states. Earlier this year, the FCC blocked nine companies from participating in the program. Commissioners are also considering a proposal to cap the total amount spent on the program. Democrat commissioner Mignon Clyburn says the suggested cap is $820 million, more than half the current budget of $2.25 billion. In their decisions, Republican FCC commissioners who voted to consider the proposals and implement the new rules cited a May 2017 Government Accountability Report that found waste, fraud, and abuse in the program. Critics say new and proposed restrictions could harm poor consumers. In a statement, commissioner Clyburn said eliminating resellers would mean a lot of people would have to find new internet providers, and may not have options other than the one they use. ""Over 70% of wireless Lifeline consumers will be told they cannot use their preferred carrier and preferred plan, and on top of that, they may not have a carrier to turn to after that happens,"" Clyburn wrote. Some of the proposals will go out for public comment before the commission meets to vote again next year."
"Flux became a hit, so they started accepting online orders. They packaged and shipped them out to customers from a fraternity house. ""It wasn't the greatest condition for running a business, especially in terms of just cleanliness, so that's when we decided to outsource distribution,"" said Flux co-founder Miles Anthony. Now, Flux chargers are sold between $30 and $50 at B8ta, a retail store with eight locations in the U.S. The tech gadget store is betting on a new kind of business model. Instead of taking a percentage of any profits, it charges hardware makers a flat fee to display their product. For example, Flux pays $2,000 a month for placement in multiple stores. In exchange, B8ta collects data on show shoppers interact with products. Its San Francisco store has 24 stereoscopic cameras monitoring visitors sales and browsing habits. The cameras are clearly visible throughout the store, and the data collected is anonymous, the company said. Although some retailers already track shopper behavior, B8ta has folded it into how it does business. The gadget makers get updates with how many impressions, discoveries, demos and sales their products have received. Related: Amazon wants you to shop for Black Friday in augmented reality Another goal of the store is to educate shoppers about products. In fact, b8Ta doesn't even care if you buy the items somewhere else. ""if you want to buy this on Amazon, that's OK,"" said B8ta's co-founder Phillip Raub. ""We're not threatened by that at all."" Inside, the space looks like an Apple Store's moodier cousin. B8ta stores are open and minimalist, with lines of products available to touch and test. An iPad Mini sits next to each gadget and displays product information about it. B8ta's inventory is a mix of useful and kitschy technology, not unlike what you'd find in a Brookstone or Sharper Image. There are wi-fi speakers, security cameras, electric bikes, and connected home devices. If you're looking for something unusual try the floss dispenser that frowns when you go too long without flossing, or the Fondoodler cheese-dispensing ""hot-glue gun."" A spot in a real brick-and-mortar store wouldn't be possible for many of these companies. The majority of gadgets come from startups founded by people who whipped up a hit Kickstarter campaign. ""Where else would they have the opportunity to bring their hardware into a store?"" said Vibhu Norby, another of B8ta's co-founders. Founded in 2015, the company wants to position itself as the next trend in retail, an industry currently undergoing big changes. Traditional stores are closing at an alarming rate, retail stocks are struggling and some companies are going bankrupt. B8ta sees the shifts more as an opportunity than a warning. ""We're sick and tired of saying retail's dead,"" said Norby. ""It's too important of an industry to just write off and say it's dead."" Related: The future of getting dressed: AI, VR and smart fabrics Meanwhile, online sales are increasing, fueled by companies like Amazon. But retail will survive because there's no way to recreate ""the emotional experience of a demo,"" according to B8ta's founders. You can't tell how a product feels in your hand or hear the quality of a high-end speaker over the internet. ""It's quite clear that a whole host of legacy players are becoming increasingly irrelevant,"" said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia's Graduate School of Business. ""There is no shortage of customers and most have plenty of disposable income and/or access to consumer credit. They will most definitely continue to shop for their needs and wants. They just aren't shopping at their ubiquitous local Macy's or JC Penney anymore."" One way those legacy retailers are trying stay relevant is by partnering with B8ta. The company has struck deals with established chains like Lowe's and Macy's to open mini-stores inside their existing locations. For Flux's Anthony, it's one less thing to worry about. He said the entire production process for his chargers is automated ¡ª he doesn't even see the product anymore. Flux chargers are manufactured in China and shipped directly to a distribution company in Austin that stores and ships the inventory. The vast majority of Flux's sales currently happen on Amazon.com, but a retail spot still has its allure. ""We got into a pretty cool tech store,"" said Anthony. ""It really validated our whole business and product."""

The acquisition comes at a time when Williams-Sonoma is facing tough competition from companies like Amazon and Wayfair. ""More and more customers are flocking to easy search functionality that you can find on Wayfair and, increasingly, some of the augmented and digital reality shopping options,"" said Brad Thomas, equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""They're in their infancy, but it does feel like the direction this sector is going to go in over the next five to ten years,"" he said. Related: Apple teases the future of augmented reality apps Williams-Sonoma isn't the only retailer making a foray into augmented reality shopping. Ikea has released an iOS app that allows customers to pick furniture from its website and place it virtually within a room. The idea is that users can try before they buy. Meanwhile, home design company Houzz launched augmented reality shopping on its app earlier this year. Users can see what different products, such as couches, would look like in 3D in real rooms in your home. ""Many furniture or home equipment brands have launched or will soon launch new AR experiences leveraging ARKit from Apple or ARCore from Google,"" Husson said. ""AR is finally getting ready for brands, even though the technology is still early days,"" he said. ""It will scale faster than virtual reality."""
"Apple confirmed on Friday its expensive Siri-powered smart speaker has been delayed. Instead of being available in December, it will ship early next year, the company told CNN Tech. Apple HomePod will be its first big new hardware product since the Apple Watch. The tech giant announced the speaker in June at its annual developer conference. Although Siri was early to the voice assistant party, the company is late to the smart speaker trend. Amazon invented the category in 2015 with the Echo, and there are now similar options available from Google, Microsoft and Sonos. At $329, HomePod was poised to be one of the pricier smart speakers on the market, but it touts superior sound quality. Amazon's Echo line starts at $50. A Google Home Mini costs $49, but the company is also coming out with a higher-end version for $399. ""We can't wait for people to experience HomePod, Apple's breakthrough wireless speaker for the home, but we need a little more time before it's ready for?our customers,"" Apple said in a statement. ""We'll start shipping in the US, UK and Australia in early 2018."" Related: Smart speaker 101 Smart speakers use ""always listening"" microphones to detect commands, then talk back with a smart assistant, such as Siri or Alexa. They can play music, spit out trivia, manage shopping lists and put things on your calendar. The HomePod looks like an oversized toilet paper roll covered in mesh fabric. Apple said it can detect where its located in a room and adjust its sound accordingly. But unlike other companies, Apple is hesitant to open up its speaker to third-party developers. Although developers can make apps for Siri and HomePod, they're currently limited to building things like lists, notes, and messaging. HomePod will work with Apple's HomeKit platform to control smart-home devices. But voice control is designed to work only with Apple Music, the company's $10 a month subscription service. You can stream other services to it from a smartphone, but not with Siri. It's unclear why the product has been delayed, but it will miss the holiday rush. Luckily for Apple, its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 seem to be selling well enough."
"A SpaceX rocket with a super-secret payload could take flight from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday at 8 p.m. ET. Liftoff was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday night, but it was pushed back until Thursday. Then on Thursday afternoon, the launch was delayed another 24 hours. Spokesperson John Taylor said in a statement Thursday night that SpaceX decided to ""stand down"" in order to ""take a closer look"" at some data regarding the rocket's fairing, or the very top portion that houses the payload. Taylor said SpaceX is keeping its options open for a launch Friday but plans to""take the time we need to complete the data review and will then confirm a new launch date."" Zuma is headed for low-Earth orbit, but we don't know exactly where. Unlike the vast majority of its launches, SpaceX will cut off its live stream before the payload is deployed. The idea is to leave no clues about its final destination. Zuma was built for the U.S. government, and it's not unusual for the government to keep information about sensitive payloads under wraps. Typically these payloads involve a military concern, such as national security, defense or surveillance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) -- the Virginia-based aerospace and defense company that says it's ""involved"" in the Zuma mission -- declined to give any details about the spacecraft or reveal which arm of the government funded it. Related: Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin test fires game-changing rocket engine ""The U.S. Government assigned Northrop Grumman the responsibility of acquiring launch services for this mission,"" the company said in a statement. ""Northrop Grumman realizes this is a monumental responsibility and we have taken great care to ensure the most affordable and lowest risk scenario for Zuma."" Eric Berger, a veteran space reporter who writes for ArsTechnica, reported that Zuma actually belongs to the National Reconnaissance Office, a U.S. government agency that develops and maintains spy satellites. Berger acknowledges that the NRO has publicly denied that the Zuma payload belongs to the agency. SpaceX conducted a secretive launch for the NRO back in May. In that case, the agency did not shy away from claiming involvement. SpaceX also launched a covert space plane in September for the U.S. Air Force. Friday's launch is a big moment for SpaceX, even without the gravitas of carrying a top-secret governmental payload. It'll mark the company's 17th launch so far in 2017 -- a significant pickup in pace over 2016, when the company launched just eight times all year. Blue Origin CEO: We're taking tourists to space within 18 months The company hit a major snag in September 2016 when one of its rockets exploded on the launch pad, destroying a satellite that Facebook planned to use to beam internet access to remote areas of the globe. The incident left SpaceX grounded for months. And the mishap didn't do much to assure potential SpaceX customers that the fledgling company could provide the type of reliability offered by United Launch Alliance. ULA, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), boasts a pristine launch record and decades of aerospace expertise between the two parent firms. ULA completed 12 missions in 2016 compared to SpaceX's eight successful launches and one failure. But SpaceX came roaring back in 2017. With 16 flawless launches completed so far this year, it's now the busiest private-sector launch provider on the planet. ULA, for comparison, has completed seven missions. SpaceX also offers its customers cheaper price points than ULA. As part of its efforts to bring down the cost of spaceflight, SpaceX lands the first stage booster of its rockets after most of its missions. While the maneuver initially seemed far-fetched, and early attempts failed, SpaceX has now mastered it. If the first-stage booster lands safely after Friday's launch, it'll mark the 20th successful rocket landing out of 25 attempts."
"Anyone with a free Amazon Web Services account could have looked at the hoard of information stored in the cloud by the U.S. Defense Department, according to Chris Vickery, a researcher at cybersecurity firm UpGuard who discovered the exposure. Amazon Web Services is a cloud platform that individuals, businesses and the government use for things like storing data and boosting computing power. Amazon said on its website it is best practice to restrict access to information stored in the cloud to ""people that absolutely need it."" The military databases hold at least 1.8 billion internet posts scraped from social media, news sites, forums and other publicly available websites, Vickery told CNN Tech. The posts are in multiple languages and originate from countries across the world, including the United States. The information, which Vickery said goes back as far back as 2009, is held by U.S. Central Command (Centcom) and U.S. Pacific Command (Pacom). There's no indication that malicious attackers accessed the databases. The Defense Department secured the data by October 1 after Vickery alerted officials of the problem in mid-September, he said. The information that was exposed had been publicly available -- it was not, for instance, sensitive user data. Still, the failure to fully secure the data raises concerns about government cybersecurity practices. ""[It's] a pretty serious leak when you're talking about intelligence information being stored in an Amazon cloud service and not properly safeguarded,"" said Timothy Edgar, a former White House official in the Obama administration and former U.S. intelligence official. Edgar said he frequently questioned the security and implementation of cloud technology while working in intelligence. ""That's exactly what we were worried about,"" he said. Cloud computing allows a large organization like a government agency or business to readily access information stored on remote servers from far-flung locations. It is increasingly how data is stored. The Defense Department confirmed the exposure in an email to CNN Tech. ""We determined that the data was accessed via unauthorized means by employing methods to circumvent security protocols,"" said Maj. Josh Jacques, a spokesperson for U.S. Central Command. ""Once alerted to the unauthorized access, Centcom implemented additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access."" How the data was discovered Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) servers where data is stored, called S3 buckets, are private by default. Private means only authorized users can access them. For one to be made more widely accessible, someone would have to configure it to be available to all Amazon Web Services users, but users would need to know or find the name of the bucket in order to access it. By searching specific keywords, Vickery identifies information that companies and organizations inadvertently expose. In this case, he looked for buckets containing the word ""com."" Three S3 buckets were configured to allow anyone with an Amazon Web Services account to access them. They were labeled ""centcom-backup,"" ""centcom-archive"" and ""pacom-archive,"" Vickery said. Last week, Amazon introduced new S3 security features, including displaying an indicator next to any bucket that is publicly accessible. Related: Data of almost 200 million voters leaked online This is not the first exposure of data Vickery has discovered. He previously found major leaks from Verizon and a Republican analytics firm. Both firms closed the security holes once alerted to the issue. ""The overall goal is to make people aware that data breaches and companies exposing data haphazardly is a huge, epidemic-sized problem,"" Vickery said. ""If something of this size and importance suffers from the same problem, we need to start taking it a lot more seriously."" This isn't the first time Centcom experienced an online security failure. In 2015, hackers took over the agency's Twitter account. What's inside The data that was exposed includes information from Twitter, Facebook and other public websites. The posts originate from many countries and are written in different languages, with an emphasis on Arabic, Farsi, and other Central and South Asian dialects spoken in Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to Vickery. Although the content goes back eight years, the uploads appear to have begun in 2013 and were ongoing when Vickery found the data. Vickery analyzed a small fraction of it. Posts included comments from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook; local U.S. websites that focus on sports and guns; scam alert websites; and forums containing offensive content. UpGuard, Vickery's firm, shared some English-language posts with CNN Tech. Topics included: American history, President Trump, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, ""killer clowns,"" Russia, former President Obama, Russian president Vladimir Putin, American pop stars, and the Pope. Inside one Centcom data bucket is a folder labeled Outpost. Vickery's analysis indicates the folder contains information from a third-party contractor called Vendor X. This company no longer has an active presence online. According to the LinkedIn profile of Erik Kjell Berg, former vice president of product at Vendor X, Outpost is ""a multilingual social analytics platform designed to positively influence change in high-risk youth in unstable regions of the world, built exclusively for the Dept. of Defense."" Berg and other former executives for Vendor X did not respond to requests for comment. Jacques, the spokesperson for U.S. Central Command, said Centcom has used commercial off-the-shelf and web-based programs for information gathering. ""The information we gather is widely available to anyone who conducts similar online activities,"" he said. What the data is used for The purpose of the data collection effort is not clear. Jacques said it is ""used for measurement and engagement activities of our online programs on public sites."" He declined to elaborate, although he said it ""is not collected nor processed for any intelligence purposes."" Edgar worked in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under President George W. Bush and later advised President Obama on privacy and cybersecurity issues. He said the rules around open-source information gathering by government agencies remain at least partly unclear. ""There have been continuing question marks about the role of collecting publicly available information from social media,"" he said. ""Government intelligence officers say we shouldn't inhibit ourselves when we're talking about collecting information about potential terrorists. If the rules allow it, we should do it. But that kind of approach can get problematic because it doesn't offer a whole lot of guidance."" Another expert, Andrea Little Limbago, chief social scientist at cybersecurity firm Endgame, said it's not uncommon for the Pentagon to collect vast sums of internet data. ""At times, you do need to cast a wide net, and then do the analytics to narrow down what you're trying to find,"" said Limbago, a former analyst with the Defense Department between 2007 and 2011. She said she would be surprised if the Defense Department was targeting U.S. individuals without the proper authorization."
"The authors behind the best-selling children's book ""Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls"" are once again putting a modern spin on fairy tales with a collection of real-life female super heroes. The book, which debuted in 2016, featured 100 stories about the lives of women, from Queen Elizabeth I to Serena Williams. Now, ""Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls Volume 2"" -- due out November 20 -- builds on what they first started. It includes another 100 stories of female scientists, engineers, judges and painters to encourage young girls to grow up to be and do whatever they choose. Among those featured are teenage eagle hunter Aisholpan Nurgaiv; the NASA women who inspired the film ""Hidden Figures"" (Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson); and ""Frankenstein"" author Mary Shelley. The stories come from all over the world, including China, North Korea and the Sudan. Like with the first book, all visuals are drawn by female illustrators. ""The main message of the book is extraordinary women are all around us,"" co-author Elena Favilli told CNN. ""They are your neighbor, your friend, your classmate, your teacher, your mom."" Before the original book became a New York Times bestseller, it was the most funded children's book in the history of Kickstarter, raising more than $675,000 from 13,000 backers in one month. Related: In cash-strapped schools, nonprofit gives kids tech training  Favilli, 35, and fellow author Francesca Cavallo, 34, moved to Silicon Valley from Italy in 2012 to launch Timbuktu Labs, a children's focused publisher. The first product was Timbuktu Magazine, an iPad news magazine for kids. However, the odds were stacked against the two women trying to grow the company. ""All the investors you talk to are men,"" Favilli told CNN Tech. ""They ask if you have kids, or tell you your idea is cute, but it won't be big enough."" ""We were told again and again we would never be able to raise serious money from venture capitalists,"" she said. ""At some point, you start doubting yourself and start thinking maybe they're right."" In 2015, Favilli and Cavallo moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Ultimately, they wanted to compile a series of short stories about extraordinary women into a book. They turned to crowdfunding to help finance the project. With a modest goal of raising $40,000, the book was funded in 48 hours. Related: 11 hottest toys for this holiday season ""The response was phenomenal,"" Favilli said. The book has since since been published in over 30 languages, including those spoken in conservative markets. (Turkey is its fourth largest market behind Spain, Italy and the United States). Global sales are nearing one million copies sold. The authors are also launching a podcast in January that will elaborate on the stories featured in the book. The team also plans to expand its Timbuktu Labs publishing platform so more female authors and illustrators can bypass traditional publishers or distributors and sell directly to consumers. Considering Favilli is out to change publishing -- and in many ways, already has -- she's proof women everywhere can make their fairy tales come true. When asked what advice she'd give to others, she points to the dedication in the first book. ""To the rebel girls of the world: Dream bigger, aim higher, fight harder and when in doubt, remember you are right."""
"On Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein cited the recent Texas mass shooting as an example of why encryption backdoors -- or ways to circumvent security and privacy protocols -- are necessary. The tech company said it offered to help the FBI after the agency said it could not unlock the phone of Texas shooter Devin Kelley. He is accused of killing 26 people and then himself at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas on Sunday. ""Our team immediately reached out to the FBI after learning from their press conference on Tuesday that investigators were trying to access a mobile phone,"" Apple (AAPL, Tech30) said in a statement. ""We offered assistance and said we would expedite our response to any legal process they send us."" A source familiar with the matter confirmed the phone was an iPhone. The FBI declined to comment. The source told CNN that law enforcement agencies did not contact Apple for help within 48 hours after the shooting. Consequently, investigators may have lost crucial time that could have helped them investigate the shooter's phone. The 48-hour window In theory, law enforcement could have used the shooter's fingerprint, even if deceased, to unlock the device in the hours following the incident. Researchers have previously shown it's possible to easily spoof the fingerprint sensor if you have a clay replica of the person's finger. The FBI would not need Apple's assistance to unlock the phone in this manner. If the the agency had called Apple, the company may have suggested this method. However, it's unclear whether the shooter had Touch ID enabled. But the fingerprint scanner no longer works if the iPhone hasn't been unlocked for 48 hours -- Apple then requires users to input a passcode. Some Android phones have similar time limits before requiring a passcode to unlock. Apple has featured the 48-hour time limit since rolling out Touch ID in 2013. Its decision to frequently require the passcode helps people remember the security key. iPhone users must also enter the passcode to do things like update their software. Related: DOJ grows frustrated with tech firms over encryption Other methods Some security experts have speculated the Texas incident could further the debate on encryption backdoors. California Senator Dianne Feinstein reportedly wants to revisit proposed legislation to require tech firms to share encrypted messages if given a warrant, according to a Politico report. The encryption issue came to a head in 2015 following the San Bernardino terror attack. Apple CEO Tim Cook very publicly pushed back on the FBI's order to create software that could unlock one of the shooter's iPhones. ""In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession,"" Cook wrote in a letter. Ultimately, the FBI found an alternative solution to get the information needed: it paid around $1 million to hack that iPhone. Anyone, including law enforcement, can buy hacking tools to break into phones and computers. But, as witnessed in the case of the iPhone hack, these tools can be expensive. Security experts believe the Texas shooting case is different. There is no suggestion of co-conspirators and it won't end up in court, said Nicholas Weaver, lecturer in the computer science department at UC Berkeley. Weaver said there are other ways for law enforcement to get similar data to what you would get unlocking an iPhone. For example, law enforcement can compel Apple to provide iCloud backups of information stored on the phone and disable the remote wipe feature. Tech companies such as Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) can also provide chat logs or other information when compelled by law enforcement. Further, cell phone providers can hand over data related to location and with whom a criminal is exchanging texts. Law enforcement can also get information from message recipients. Another workaround: If someone backs up a phone to a computer, it's possible to get the data from the computer instead. Weaver said computers tend to be weaker in terms of preventing analysis without a password. Apple said the company works with law enforcement every day. Its latest transparency report said law enforcement requests range from asking for information about stolen credit cards to account purchase history. The report also revealed law enforcement submitted 4,479 device-based requests and 1,692 account requests from Apple during the first half of 2017. The company provided data 80% of the time for device requests and and 84% for account inquiries. During the same time frame, Twitter received 2,111 account information requests from the U.S. government and turned over at least some information 77% of the time. ""We offer training to thousands of agents so they understand our devices and how they can quickly request information from Apple,"" the company said in a statement."
"Recent reports have called attention to troves of videos with profanity and violent themes on YouTube Kids, the video-sharing site's kid-friendly platform. Content for YouTube Kids is pulled from the main YouTube platform using machine learning and algorithms. But some videos, such as cartoons disguised as age appropriate, slip through the cracks. Videos flagged as inappropriate for kids will be slapped with an age-restriction warning on its main YouTube app. This will prevent them from being pulled onto the Kids app. Only those logged into YouTube who are over the age of 18 will be able to view it. Videos flagged with an age restriction (18 and older) are already banned from YouTube Kids. The app is geared toward children under 13. The Google-owned company announced it will roll out the new policy in the coming weeks. But it told CNN Tech the move is not in response to recent headlines but to improve upon the service. A Medium post made rounds this week from writer James Bridle, who detailed the content he's noticed on YouTube Kids for ""some time."" ""Disturbing Peppa Pig videos, which [promote] extreme violence and fear, with Peppa eating her father or drinking bleach, are, it turns out very widespread,"" he wrote. ""The architecture [YouTube and Google] built to extract the maximum revenue from online video is being hacked by persons unknown to abuse children,"" he added. Related: To combat revenge porn, Facebook wants some users to send their intimate photos Last week, YouTube's global head of family and learning content Malik Ducard told The New York Times the inappropriate videos were ""the extreme needle in the haystack.""

Multiple curse words appeared in the first 17 seconds alone -- but it is not yet flagged as age-restricted content. In the past 30 days, the company said that less than .005% of videos viewed in the Kids app were removed for being inappropriate.

"It took just two minutes and one second for e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) to hit $1 billion in sales for Singles Day, China's annual online shopping extravaganza, the company said Saturday. Alibaba's sales topped $10 billion after an hour and six minutes. Singles Day takes place each year on November 11. It started as an informal holiday, sometimes dubbed an anti-Valentine's Day, intended to celebrate those not in relationships. Alibaba began using the day for product discounts in 2009. The company has since turned it into a global event with discounted products and celebrity appearances. Think Black Friday, but even more staggering.

"India's biggest online retailer will be hoping its first device -- the Billion Capture+ -- will avoid the fate of the Amazon Fire Phone by tapping into explosive growth in mobile users in its home market. The phone's design draws on detailed analysis of millions of customer reviews of devices sold on Flipkart, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement. Flipkart launched its Billion brand earlier this year to create products tailored to the local market. ""It is a truly made for India phone,"" said Hrishikesh Thite, head of the Billion brand. Related: India's Flipkart now has a $4 billion war chest The Capture+ runs an Android operating system and will be available in 32GB and 64GB variants, priced at around $170 and $200 respectively. For comparison, the new iPhone X costs nearly $1,400 in India and the new Google Pixel 2 costs over $900. The Indian phone's price point will make it more of a competitor to Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, whose RedMi Note 4 also sells for between $170 and $200. Flipkart's new device will go on sale next Wednesday, the company said. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) introduced the quickly-forgotten Fire Phone three years ago. It was initially priced at $200, but a lackluster reception led Amazon to slash the price to just 99 cents right before Apple (AAPL, Tech30) released the iPhone 6.

"The startup had been seeking to overturn a 2016 decision that meant its drivers in the country would qualify for the minimum wage, paid time off and other perks. It's the latest in a series of stumbles for the company in Britain. London, one of its most important markets, declined to renew the firm's license in September. Uber has been allowed to keep operating in the city while it appeals the decision. Friday's court ruling could prove to be more important in the long run, however. Uber has argued in markets around the world that its drivers should be treated as contractors, a classification that typically means fewer benefits and less job security. In Britain, the U.S. firm's position was contested by GMB, a union for professional drivers. The union hailed the ruling as a ""landmark victory"" and ""vindication"" for its members. Uber said it would launch another appeal in the case, which could end up in the country's Supreme Court. ""Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed,"" Uber said in a statement.

The pop-up shops will allow customers to test out Amazon devices, such as Echo smart speakers and Fire tablets, and learn about services like its Prime membership, which includes free two-day shipping and access to music and video content. The shops, which will be staffed by Amazon employees, open next week in Illinois, Colorado, Michigan, Florida and California. Related: Amazon shops to open inside some Kohl's stores The move is in line with Amazon growing its presence in retail stores and most recently, Whole Foods. In August, Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. The company has since cut prices at the grocery chain and showcased its gadgets at some stores. On Thursday, Amazon said its devices are currently available at more than 100 Whole Foods stores. In October, Amazon launched ""smart home spaces"" inside 10 Kohl's stores in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas. In addition to showing off Amazon gadgets, shoppers can book experts to install these devices in their home. The tech giant also sell its devices at its 13 Amazon bookstores. Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester, said this is the latest example of Amazon trying to leverage its Prime membership wherever it can. ""I suspect we'll see Prime prices or other benefits coming to Whole Foods customers soon,"" she told CNN Tech. Mulpuru sees other recent moves, such as Kohl's accepting Amazon returns at certain locations, as a way to further appeal to customers. ""Shoppers want to return items to physical stores and Kohl's is looking for new ways to drive traffic,"" Mulpuru said. ""It makes complete sense for Amazon to use [physical] stores and those shoppers wherever possible to make the experience easier for its customers."""
"In late 2016, two people outside the company accessed the personal information of 57 million Uber users including names, email addresses and phone numbers, the company said. Hackers also accessed driver's license numbers of around 600,000 drivers in the United States. The 600,000 was included in the total number of affected users. The company did not alert victims or regulators of the breach when they discovered it happened. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement he recently learned of the breach. Khosrowshahi, who became CEO in August, said he launched an investigation into why the company did not alert authorities or individuals affected by the hack. He said, ""two of the individuals who led the response to this incident are no longer with the company."" Khosrowshahi said the company is now notifying regulatory authorities.

We also implemented security measures to restrict access to and strengthen controls on our cloud-based storage accounts,"" he said. Uber did not say how hackers assured the company the stolen data was destroyed. Bloomberg reported that Uber paid them $100,000. Uber would not confirm it paid this ransom. According to the company, no location history, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or dates of birth were downloaded in the hack. Uber said it is providing free credit monitoring to drivers who had their license numbers exposed. It's the latest blow to Uber, which is trying to improve its public image. The company has been embroiled in a number of controversies, including using software called Greyball to evade regulators, a court battle over allegedly stolen secrets from Google's self-driving car division, and a slew of complaints regarding sexual harassment and toxic company culture. This week, the company was fined almost $9 million for background check issues in Colorado. In his statement, Khosrowshahi said things will be different moving forward. ""While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes,"" he wrote."
"On Monday, the Justice Department sued to block a mega-deal between AT&T (T, Tech30) and Time Warner (TWX), CNN's parent company. The agency argues the deal would give AT&T too much power to harm competition for video distributors, including online video services. Then on Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission announced plans to repeal net neutrality protections. The Obama-era rules were intended to ensure that internet and wireless service providers -- like AT&T -- can't handicap or favor certain online services. The result: One government agency is trying to rein in a telecom company, in part to protect the competitive landscape online. And another is planning to undo rules designed to keep telecoms in check, potentially upending the competitive landscape online. ""People are just kind of confused,"" said Tim Wu, a professor of antitrust law at Columbia Law School who opposes the Trump administration's plan to repeal the protections.

""There is definitely a huge disconnect,"" says Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, who ran the agency under President Barack Obama when it approved the net neutrality rules in 2015. The FCC did not review the AT&T deal because no FCC licenses would change hands. Related: President Trump speaks on AT&T-Time Warner deal: 'not good for the country' Although it's not entirely apples to apples, Sohn says there's ""definitely overlap"" between the Justice Department's argument to block the merger and the argument for net neutrality, particularly when it comes to online video. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, argued in a statement that AT&T could ""impede disruptive competition from online video distributors"" that threaten its business by charging rival services more for Time Warner shows and movies, or simply withholding access to that content. That could make it harder for the next Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) to compete. Net neutrality advocates, meanwhile, argued that providers like AT&T shouldn't be able to prioritize their own content over rivals by loading it faster or serving it more cheaply, nor should they be able to charge a service like Netflix more money to get its content into a so-called ""fast lane."" In both cases, Sohn says, it boils down to a concern that content distributors -- in this case AT&T -- should not be able to ""pick and choose who wins and loses."" The Justice Department and the FCC declined to comment. A government official close to the Justice Department stressed that the two agencies ""operate under different statutory mandates."" ""There are considerable inconsistencies, even though the issues are based on different areas of U.S. law,"" says Craig Aaron, president and CEO of Free Press, a nonpartisan group that advocates press freedom and a fair internet. Related: Some politicians and advocacy groups cautiously praise DOJ's AT&T lawsuit The stark difference in approach by the two agencies was perhaps most apparent in the reaction from consumer advocacy groups. Organizations like Free Press have spent much of this year publicly attacking the FCC and its chairman, Ajit Pai, for not doing enough to protect consumers. The group helped organize a major protest to defend net neutrality and criticized Pai for paving the way for media conglomerates. But on Monday, the group turned into a cheerleader for the Justice Department, praising the antitrust lawsuit as ""refreshing."" ""Ajit Pai might have something to learn from the career lawyers at the DOJ,"" Aaron told CNNMoney. Gene Kimmelman, president and CEO of Public Knowledge, another advocacy group for an open internet and access to affordable communication tools, echoed the sentiment. ""One agency is forcefully doing its duty enforcing the law thoroughly and carefully,"" he said. ""The other agency is being much more lax and favorable to the dominant internet service providers and should be doing more."" --CNNMoney's David Goldman contributed to this report."
"According to the report, ProPublica was able to buy dozens of home rental advertisements targeted toward audiences that specifically excluded ""African Americans, mothers of high school kids, people interested in wheelchair ramps, Jews, expats from Argentina and Spanish speakers."" ""Our tests showed a significant lapse in the company's monitoring of the rental market,"" the ProPublica report said. Every ad was approved within minutes, it said. Facebook said the ad placements were the result of ""a failure in our enforcement."" ""We're disappointed that we fell short of our commitments,"" Ami Vora, vice president of product management at Facebook (FB, Tech30), said in an emailed statement to CNN Tech. ""The rental housing ads purchased by ProPublica should have but did not trigger the extra review and certifications we put in place due to a technical failure."" Discriminatory housing-related advertisements are not allowed under the 1968 Fair Housing Act. The law prohibits advertising the rental or sale of homes and discriminating ""based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin."" A person familiar with the matter said the terminology regarding renting was miscategorized and those Facebook ads were not being flagged properly. Related: Facebook cracks down on discriminatory ads In 2016, ProPublica found housing ads on Facebook could exclude ""Ethnic Affinities."" Facebook promised to improve policies and tools around advertising to prevent discrimination following that investigation. In February of this year, Facebook updated its rules to further clarify ""advertisers may not discriminate against people based on personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, family status, disability, medical or genetic condition."" Vora said in her statement Facebook's protections have flagged ""millions"" of advertisements, and ""tens of thousands"" of advertisers comply with tighter restrictions. Vora also said Facebook is expanding compliance notifications to all advertisers who exclude some users from seeing their ads, not just those who place ads for housing, employment, or credit. If an advertiser excludes people from seeing its advertisements, they will receive a notice asking them to make sure their ads don't violate any Facebook rules or U.S. discrimination laws. Facebook will also be hiring more ad reviewers to make sure ads aren't violating rules, Vora said."
"Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, unveiled his controversial plan to repeal Obama-era protections intended to keep the internet open and fair. ""Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet,"" Pai said in a statement Tuesday. ""Instead, the FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices."" The repeal would represent a fundamental shift to how the internet is regulated. The current net neutrality rules, approved in 2015, internet providers like Comcast (CCVCL) and AT&T (T, Tech30) are barred from deliberately speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific websites and apps. The goal was to prevent those internet providers from picking winners and losers among content providers. The new proposal would do away with rules that prohibit internet providers from blocking or slowing down access to online content and services, according to senior FCC officials outlining the changes on a call with reporters. It would also eliminate a rule barring providers from prioritizing their own content, or the content of third-party services it strikes deals with. In the absence of a firm ban on these actions, providers will be required to publicly disclose any instance of blocking, throttling or paid prioritization, according to the FCC officials. It will then be evaluated based on whether or not the activity is anti-competitive. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, has been a longtime critic of the net neutrality rules. Since President Trump appointed him as FCC chairman in January, Pai has made reversing the rules a key part of his deregulatory agenda. Pai's decision to seek a full repeal of the rules was praised by the telecommunications trade groups as a boon for broadband investment, but loudly panned by the tech industry and consumer advocacy groups. Related: Trump's FCC may try to roll back net neutrality. Here's why that matters The Internet Association, a trade group that represents Facebook, Google and Amazon, described Pai's proposal as ""the end of net neutrality as we know it."" ""This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans' ability to access the entire internet,"" Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat representing Oregon, called the proposal ""the crowning achievement of the most anti-consumer FCC chair in history."" The announcement comes more than six months after the FCC kicked off the lengthy process to roll back the net neutrality protections. It received millions of comments during a review period, with the majority supporting the current protections. Much of the tech industry also staged protests in defense of net neutrality. Pai began circulating his proposal among the FCC commissioners on Tuesday. The full proposal will be made public on Wednesday. Mignon Clyburn, one of the two Democratic FCC commissioners, slammed the timing of the release as a ""Pre-Holiday News Dump."" ""In just two days, many of us will join friends and family in celebrating the spirit of Thanksgiving,"" Clyburn said in a statement to CNN Tech. ""But as we learned today, the FCC majority is about to deliver a cornucopia full of rotten fruit, stale grains, and wilted flowers topped off with a plate full of burnt turkey."" The FCC will vote on the repeal at its monthly hearing December 14. The Republican-led agency is expected to approve it on a party-line vote. If it does, the issue may head to court. ""Whenever we do anything big and major, people go to court,"" a senior FCC official said on the call. ""I certainly would not rule that out."""
"Human resource departments are supposed to drive investigations into workplace complaints and help employees work through other internal issues. But some warn HR always isn't on your side and it exists to protect the business, not individuals. Bravely, a new startup, wants to serve an ombudsman for employees that can listen to their issues and provide guidance. An ombudsman has been suggested by some women, such as Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who've spoken out about their own workplace harassment stories. She advocated for the concept in a New York Times op-ed. Bravely matches employees with its network of vetted coaches or HR professionals for 45 minute off-the-record phone conversations. Discussions range from how to deliver feedback to direct reports to how to talk to a manager for a raise. They may also include sexual harassment or discrimination issues. Bravely's intention is to be a neutral third-party for employees. Related: How do you report when there's no HR? ""We don't give advice,"" said cofounder Toby Hervey. ""We help employees assess their options and structure their thoughts. We're not your HR person you might run into in the kitchen."" It pairs employees with its HR staffers after filtering for the type of issue, seniority of the employee, and more. For example, issues related to sexual harassment and discrimination go to a specialized group of Bravely contractors, who keep the company's policies on-hand to help break them down for employees. The New York City-based startup launched in June, as stories about harassment bubbled up across the tech industry. The timing was coincidental. While Hervey declined to share how many clients already use Bravely, he projects 30 businesses will be on board by the end of the year. Bravely is free for employees. The employer itself pays a fee to use the service. The cost depends on the company size; the current rate is between $5 and $8 for each employee, each month. Bravely has raised $1.5 million in funding to get the business off the ground. It declined to name its current partners but said most of its investors are startups with 50 to 500 employees. Cynthia Shapiro, author of the book ""Corporate Confidential,"" has provided coaching for employees for the past 16 years through her consulting business. ""The only way to do it is to have a totally neutral third-party person with no dog in the hunt,"" she said. But there's a gray area related to making money from participating employers while working in the best interest of employees. Companies may be reticent to introduce something that could potentially used against them. Related: Months after sexual harassment allegations rock tech world, not much has changed Bravely only reports back some information to employers, such as how many people are using the service and general themes and trends. Hervey said the startup ""errs on the side of not reporting [too much]"" for confidentiality reasons. But if the same person's name keeps popping up about harassment, or management issues, Bravely may notify the employer and surface the issue. Since its launch, Bravely has managed ""hundreds"" of calls from workers. According to Hervey, the vast majority of inquiries have come from women, people of color, and LGBTQ workers. About a quarter of calls have dealt with managers preparing for conversations with their direct reports. Shapiro -- who typically charges individuals between $300 to $500 for a session, but is tax deductable -- services about 1,000 clients per year, some of whom have monthly appointments. She's also hiring an ""army"" of subcontractors, she said. Meanwhile, Bravely has been getting more requests from people whose companies don't offer the service. ""[It] is making us think about introducing something for individuals,"" he added."
"On Tuesday, two anonymous women filed a complaint in California against Uber claiming the ridesharing company had falsely presented its service as safe to passengers. Both women say they were raped by drivers. They state that they ordered the service after a couple of drinks, believing it to be safe. ""Uber's advertising campaigns make the assertion that it provides the best option for a safe ride home after a night of drinking,"" the suit alleges. ""[But] what happened to Ms. Does 1 and 2 is happening to women across the U.S. Shockingly, it is happening with greater frequency."" The new suit is seeking class action status to include individuals who have alleged or reported ""rape, sexual assault or gender-motivated violence or harassment"" by Uber drivers in the past four year. The lawsuit claims that ""thousands of female passengers have endured unlawful conduct by their Uber drivers"" over the past seven years. In a statement, Uber said it ""received this complaint today and we are in the process of reviewing it. These allegations are important to us and we take them very seriously."" Attorney Jeanne Christensen from employment law firm Wigdor LLP, who brought the case, is calling on Uber to release data that proves to customers that it is, in fact, statistically safe to ride in an Uber. ""They should be forced to report, on some kind of periodic level, how many reports [of assault, rape] they've had. And based on the reports, were there investigations that actually resulted in the termination of a driver?"" Christensen said in a call with CNN Tech. Her firm has been following the issue of alleged rape and assault by Uber drivers since 2014, when it filed the New Delhi driver rape case. ""I'm not asking for anything crazy. It's not crazy. If they don't have an issue, then they should be waving that data around."" The suit asks for an injunction that would direct the company to make changes to its screening process, as well as implement new monitoring of drivers to protect riders from rape, assault, and gender-based harassment. Uber has in the past shunned the idea of fingerprint-based background tests in most markets, saying the checks can be costly and slow, and impact the company's ability to constantly bring on new drivers. Questions about how the company screens its drivers were raised again earlier this month after the suspect in a terror attack in Manhattan was revealed to be a driver for both Uber and Lyft. Uber said it was quickly and aggressively reviewing Sayfullo Saipov's history with the company but hadn't found any safety reports that raised concerns. Lyft also didn't find any red flags associated with his account, the company said. Both Uber and Lyft said they were in contact with law enforcement authorities over the New York attack. Related: What we know (and don't know) about Uber background checks The 58-page complaint filed Tuesday details 17 safety measures that the company could implement to make riders safer. Those include requiring drivers to install GPS tracking systems in their cars rather than relying on the app which can be turned off, as well as performing criminal background checks every six months. In general, Uber says it searches records for the past seven years. But according to the suit, for drivers who moved to the U.S. less than seven years ago, the company doesn't seek to obtain records in their previous country of residence."
"It's a seven-minute video, a collaboration between University of California-Berkeley professor Stuart Russell and the Future of Life Institute that shows a future in which palm-sized, autonomous drones use facial recognition technology and on-board explosives to commit untraceable massacres. The film is the researchers' latest attempt to build support for a global ban on autonomous weapon systems, which kill without meaningful human control. They released the video to coincide with meetings the United Nations' Convention on Conventional Weapons is holding this week in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss autonomous weapons. ""We have an opportunity to prevent the future you just saw, but the window to act is closing fast,"" said Russell, an artificial intelligence professor, at the film's conclusion. ""Allowing machines to choose to kill humans will be devastating to our security and freedom."" In the film, thousands of college students are killed in attacks at a dozen universities after drones swarm campuses. Some of the drones first attach to buildings, blowing holes in walls so other drones can enter and hunt down specific students. A similar scene is shown at the U.S. Capitol, where a select group of Senators were killed. Such atrocities aren't possible today, but given the trajectory of tech's development, that will change in the future. The researchers warn that several powerful nations are moving toward autonomous weapons, and if one nation deploys such weapons, it may trigger a global arms race to keep up. Related: Futuristic cop cars may identify suspects Because of these concerns, top artificial intelligence researchers have spent several years calling for a ban on autonomous weapons, which are sometimes called ""killer robots."" The researchers warn that one day terrorists may be able to buy and use such drones to easily kill in huge numbers. ""A $25 million order now buys this, enough to kill half a city,"" a defense contractor in the film describes as swarms of tiny drones fly out of a cargo plane. The film is a sensationalistic turn in the approaches autonomous weapons critics have used to push for a ban. In the past, they relied on open letters and petitions with academic language. In 2015, thousands of AI and robotics researchers joined tech leaders such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking in calling for a ban on offensive autonomous weapons. That letter spoke of ""armed quadcopters,"" while this week's video warns of ""slaughterbots."" Earlier this month, leading artificial intelligence researchers in Canada and Australia called on their governments to support a ban on lethal autonomous weapon systems. This week's new approach appears to be the result of the apparent gravity of the situation. This summer, a report from Harvard University's Belfer Center warned that weapons using artificial intelligence will be as transformative as nuclear weapons."
"The short-term rental firm said Tuesday that hosts in four central Paris neighborhoods will be prevented from renting out their entire homes for more than 120 nights per year starting in 2018. The restrictions will bring Airbnb into line with rules already on the books in Paris, its largest city based on listings. Paris is the world's seventh most visited city, with over 14 million international visitors expected this year, according to Euromonitor International. The four affected neighborhoods include the Louvre Museum and other attractions. A spokesperson for Airbnb said it wanted ""to be good partners to the city and help ensure home sharing grows responsibly and sustainably."" But Paris officials were not impressed. Ian Brossat, the city's top housing official, said on Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) that Airbnb would still be breaking the rules in 16 other neighborhoods. Mayor Anne Hidalgo retweeted his message to her 1.3 million followers. ""The law of profit is not worth more than the laws of the [land],"" Brossat wrote in another tweet directed at Airbnb. Related: Airbnb-branded apartment building to open near Walt Disney World Airbnb promised in December 2016 that it would quit clogging up cities that are struggling with housing shortages. It started by announcing restrictions on London and Amsterdam listings, barring homeowners across the cities from renting their places to visitors for more than 90 and 60 days a year, respectively. Local authorities had already put those limits in place, but had difficulty enforcing them. Airbnb said limits in London and Amsterdam led to a sharp drop in people breaking the local rules. It may have also hurt the company's bottom line. UBS said last month that Airbnb's global growth has slowed due to city regulations and crackdowns. It said that in Berlin, where permits are now required to rent out homes, the number of listings declined by about 10% in 2017. ""We believe Airbnb still presents a threat to hoteliers but regulation has reduced the magnitude of that threat,"" UBS analysts said in a research note. Critics have long claimed that Airbnb removes affordable housing from the market by turning rentable apartments into unofficial hotels.  Other cities including San Francisco and New York have worked to crack down on Airbnb services. The company has introduced a program called ""One Host, One Home"" to stop individuals from listing and promoting multiple properties on the platform in these cities. It's also worked with lawmakers in San Francisco to help ensure host register with the city and abide by local rules. ""In New York, we have proposed a similar system which is now in front of state legislative bodies,"" said a spokesperson. Airbnb said it has worked with ""more than 350 governments across the world on fair home sharing rules."" -- Shama Nasinde in London and Saskya Vandoorne in Paris contributed to this report."
"Pai, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, has moved fast to eliminate regulations for large internet service providers and broadcast media conglomerates. In the process, Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon (VZ, Tech30) who was appointed to the FCC job by Trump, has earned the praise of the telecommunications industry and the contempt of tech companies and consumer advocacy groups. Related: Trump administration sends mixed messages on big media ""Every single thing they're doing is for incumbent telephone cable and media companies,"" Gigi Sohn, a counselor to Obama administration FCC chair Tom Wheeler, told CNNMoney earlier this year. ""Pai wants to make the big bigger and the rich richer."" Concerns about Pai's deregulatory agenda grew as the FCC unveiled significant policy proposals in the final days before the Thanksgiving holiday. Net neutrality On Tuesday, Pai unveiled his plan to repeal Obama-era net neutrality protections intended to ensure that all content online is treated the same. The net neutrality rules, approved by the previous FCC administration in 2015, prevent internet providers like Comcast (CCVCL) from deliberately speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific websites and apps. Related: Trump FCC chair unveils plan to repeal net neutrality The full proposal was published online Wednesday and is expected to pass on a party-line vote at the FCC's meeting next month. Pai said in a statement that repealing the rules will free the internet from micromanaging by the government. Critics say the repeal threatens to fracture the internet into fast lanes and slow lanes, and let internet providers offer preferential treatment to companies that are willing to pay more. The plan could also make it harder for upstart online services to compete against incumbents. As if the actual repeal weren't enough of a lightning rod, there's also controversy around the process itself. The FCC received 22 million comments from the public during a review period, but millions of those comments turned out to be fake. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Tuesday that his office has spent six months investigating ""a massive scheme to corrupt the FCC's notice and comment process,"" but he said the FCC has so far refused to provide a ""substantive response."" Schneiderman didn't say which side the fraudulent comments favored, but cited studies showing that the ""overwhelming majority"" of authentic comments were in favor of the net neutrality rules. The FCC pushed back in a statement Wednesday. ""This so-called investigation is nothing more than a transparent attempt by a partisan supporter of the Obama Administration's heavy-handed Internet regulations to gain publicity for himself,"" the statement said. Media consolidation The outcry over net neutrality overshadowed another major FCC proposal on Tuesday. Pai announced plans to review existing rules that prevent broadcast companies from owning TV stations that reach more than 39% of all TV households in the United States. The vote will take place at the same monthly meeting, on Dec. 14. Related: Sinclair's influence grows, thanks to Trump It's just the latest proposal from the FCC that paves the way for greater media consolidation. Earlier this year, the FCC voted to reinstate the ""UHF discount,"" which allows broadcasters to understate the reach of their stations. Shortly after, the conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group announced plans to acquire Tribune Media in a deal that would push the total TV stations it owns above 200 nationwide. Without the discount, Sinclair's reach would easily exceed the 39% cap. Nearly two dozen Senate Democrats sent a letter to Pai in late September expressing ""grave concerns"" with his move to upend the media landscape. ""Moves to repeal the media ownership rules threatens to create a world of corporatized, nationalized content being force fed to consumers under the guise of local news and public affairs programming,"" the senators wrote. The outcry did not slow Pai. Earlier this month, the FCC voted to eliminate a longstanding rule that prevented entities from owning a radio or TV station and a newspaper in the same market. The FCC also loosened restrictions to make it easier for a company to own more than one TV station in one market. These moves allowing for more media consolidation come at the same time that Trump's Justice Department is trying to prevent greater media consolidation by suing to stop AT&T (T, Tech30) from buying Time Warner (TWX), CNN's parent company. Internet access for low-income homes This month, the FCC also voted to begin scaling back a federal program intended to help low-income U.S. households get access to the internet. The decades-old program, called Lifeline, offers discounted phone and internet service in poorer communities. Now the commission is about to limit the recipients who can receive a $25 subsidy intended for homes on tribal lands by restricting it to rural areas only. The FCC is also considering a spending cap for the program's budget as well as preventing certain internet providers from offering Lifeline support, which might mean some in the program can't stay with their current providers. --CNNMoney's Selena Larson contributed to this report."
"At the time of the breach, Uber paid hackers $100,000 to destroy the data and did not tell regulators or users that their information was stolen. Uber is trying to salvage its reputation following a number of high-profile controversies, including using software called Greyball to evade regulators, a court battle over allegedly stolen secrets from Google's self-driving car division, and a slew of complaints regarding sexual harassment and toxic company culture. What happened Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said two hackers broke into the company in late 2016 and stole personal data, including phone numbers, email addresses, and names, of 57 million Uber users. Among those, the hackers stole 600,000 driver's license numbers of drivers for the company. Related: Uber paid hackers $100,000 after they stole data on 57 million users Khosrowshahi says hackers accessed the data through a third-party, cloud-based service. According to Bloomberg, they got into Uber's GitHub account, a site many engineers and companies use to store code and track projects. There, hackers found the username and password to access Uber user data stored in an Amazon server. Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at security firm SentinelOne, says this was not a sophisticated hack. Companies frequently accidentally keep credentials in source code that is uploaded to GitHub, he said. The $100,000 payment Instead of alerting users and authorities to the breach as required by law, Uber paid the hackers $100,000. Uber says it obtained assurances the data was destroyed. Law enforcement advises companies to not pay hackers and report breaches to the authorities. According to Andrea Matwyshyn, professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University, if companies help cyber criminals make money off hacks, they will only continue. ""The problem with viewing this as some sort of simple risk management decision is that it underestimates the basis for an attacker's business model,"" Matwyshyn told CNN Tech. ""It doesn't address the underlying problem in your own organization -- your security practices need revision and you're failing to adequately protect your assets including your own proprietary information, and your customers' data."" Paying hackers to return data is common practice. For instance, it's expected ransomware payments -- paying hackers to unlock files after a cyberattack -- will top $2 billion this year, according to new research from cybersecurity firm Bitdefender. Uber's payoff to prevent hackers from leaking the stolen data is more similar to recent extortion attempts on Netflix and HBO than ransomware campaigns. Hackers threatened to release TV shows unless the companies paid them. Neither firm paid the extortionists. New legal troubles Matwyshyn says it's possible Uber will face consequences from both state and federal agencies. Forty-eight states have security breach notification laws which require companies to disclose when hackers access private information, including California, where Uber is headquartered. State Attorneys General from New York and Massachusetts have opened investigations into the data breach. In Washington, D.C., Senator Richard Blumenthal urged the Federal Trade Commission to take action against the company and impose ""significant penalties."" ""Senate Commerce Committee should hold hearing to demand Uber explain their outrageous breach - and inexplicable delay in informing its consumers and drivers,"" Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a tweet on Wednesday. An FTC spokesman said in a statement: ""We are aware of press reports describing a breach in late 2016 at Uber and Uber officials' actions after that breach. We are closely evaluating the serious issues raised."" In January, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle FTC charges it misled drivers about how much they could make using the platform. The company also settled FTC allegations that it made deceptive privacy and security claims in August. A hacker accessed Uber data on more than 100,000 drivers in May 2014. Further, the FTC said Uber did not properly monitor employee access to customer information. The agency gave Uber 180 days to obtain an independent audit into its privacy and security practices. Tuesday's data breach notification falls within that time frame. Other countries have similar rules regarding breaches. The UK's top data privacy organization slammed Uber on Wednesday. ""If UK citizens were affected then we should have been notified so that we could assess and verify the impact on people whose data was exposed,"" James Dipple-Johnstone, deputy commissioner of the Information Commissioner's Office, said in a statement. ""Deliberately concealing breaches from regulators and citizens could attract higher fines for companies."" Yet another data breach In terms of scale, Uber's hack doesn't measure up to other major breaches. Cyber criminals targeted Equifax earlier this year, compromising the personal information -- including names, addresses and social security numbers -- of over 145 million people. In 2013, a hack of Yahoo impacted very single account -- 3 billion in total. Former executives from both of these companies have testified in front of Congress in recent months regarding their security failures and the potential risks to consumers. But Uber's breach is different -- the company tried to cover it up and did not alert authorities or users of the issue. Consumers might find this latest Uber scandal more troubling than its other legal or public relations problems now that they're the victims. Fifty-seven million people is a significant chunk of Uber's user base, which hit 40 million monthly active riders last year. Grossman says the breach may not change consumer behavior, but it will be costly for the company. ""At best, it will impact their bottom line. The cost of dealing with this -- they're going to have lawsuits and legal fees,"" Grossman said. He also said the disclosure helps get it out in the open so the company can begin moving toward repairing its reputation. Uber's future plans When Khosrowshahi became CEO in August, he inherited a slew of controversial problems. In addition to its legal troubles, Uber has faced criticism for sexual harassment issues, underpaying and deceiving drivers, questioning a rape victim, and surge pricing during times of crisis. The new CEO wants to improve Uber's reputation and on Tuesday said, ""While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes."" Khosrowshahi said the company fired two individuals who led security response. Joe Sullivan, Uber's chief security officer, is no longer with the company, it said. CEO Travis Kalanick, who was in charge when the hack took place, is still on the company's board of directors. While Khosrowshahi is promising change, Kalanick's place in a leadership role serves as a reminder they are keeping someone who signed off on controversial issues tied to the company. Uber is expected to go public in 2019."
"On Wednesday, Facebook announced a new portal that lets users see which Internet Research Agency-linked Facebook pages or Instagram accounts they liked or followed between January 2015 and August 2017, when the pages were shut down. The Internet Research Agency is a troll farm with ties to the Russian government. ""It is important that people understand how foreign actors tried to sow division and mistrust using Facebook before and after the 2016 US election,"" the company wrote in a blog post.

However, not all of those users will be able to take advantage of the portal. The tool applies to users who followed or liked those accounts. It won't work for users who saw posts from the accounts on their feed because a friend liked them or who saw them via paid advertisements.

Facebook estimates that close to 150 million Americans may have been exposed to content from the Internet Research Agency between June 2015 and August 2017 on Facebook and Instagram. California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who is the Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee, called Facebook's move a ""very positive step."" ""During our open hearing with Facebook, Twitter and Google earlier this month, we asked them to notify their users if they had been targeted by or seen content as part of the Russian active measures campaign,"" Schiff said in a statement. ""We look forward to additional steps by the companies to improve transparency with respect to Russian abuse of their platforms, and urge them to furnish a joint report on how Russia used these platforms to sow discord and influence the election."""

It will, Musk predicted, ""be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn't blow up on ascent."" Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity. Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn't blow up on ascent.  As with pretty much all timetables announced by Musk, the launch date could still change. SpaceX and Tesla have a long track record of missing the CEO's ambitious deadlines. SpaceX originally hoped to carry out the first Falcon Heavy test launch years ago. And Musk said earlier this year he was targeting November. Related: SpaceX's playbook: Make history, then make more history Musk's announcement of the planned launch of the giant rocket comes just over two months after he outlined his vision for eventually putting humans on Mars and colonizing the planet. That project will require an even larger rocket, though. It's called the BFR, or Big Falcon Rocket, which inside the company is nicknamed the ""Big F--king Rocket."" SpaceX plans to start building the first of those by the middle of next year, Musk said in late September.  He wants to land at least two of the spacecraft on Mars in 2022 carrying equipment -- and then ones transporting people in 2024. In the meantime, the Falcon Heavy is intended to boost the amount of cargo SpaceX can take into space for its customers. The company says it will be able to take into orbit more than twice the payload -- 119,000 pounds -- of its closest rival at a third of the cost. SpaceX has shaken up the aerospace industry by dramatically slashing costs and developing rockets that can blast out of the atmosphere and then come back down to land on a barge floating in the middle of the ocean. Traditionally, rockets have been used just once, and are left to burn up in the atmosphere after a mission. But SpaceX has been working for years to change that. It has said that reused rockets will be a part of the maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy, which is essentially three Falcon 9 rockets, the company's current workhorse, strapped together."
"Phones across the world running iOS 11 encountered a glitch that triggered at 12:15 a.m. local time. A bug in the 11.1.2 software meant that phones using third party apps to send recurring notifications, like reminders from work out apps or medical apps, would reboot over and over. Apple did not respond to a request for comment about the glitch and it's unclear exactly how many users were affected. A number of iPhone users took to social media and message boards to learn about the glitch and voice frustrations. ""Looks like i found this late but glad it's patched. I thought my phone was having a hardware failure, worst iOS bug i've ever experienced. This was really bad,"" wrote Reddit user KarlKrum. ""This is embarrassing. Facepalm,"" wrote Reddit user Siannath. This bug is causing reboot loops every 10-30 seconds. Apple Store staff in Australia are starting to get swamped by people coming in about it... just saw for myself.  The company took the unusual step of releasing a software update on a Saturday when it pushed iOS 11.2. The update fixes the rebooting issue and also includes Apple Pay Cash, the company's new peer to peer payment system, faster wireless charging, and new live wallpapers.

"The class, called Cyberwar, teaches its 80 students how to find security flaws in the apps and websites people use every day. ""I mostly focused on government websites, specifically voter registration websites,"" said Vy-An Phan, a junior studying electrical engineering and computer science who's enrolled in the class. During class assignments, she discovered vulnerabilities in at least five sites that could potentially be used to trick someone into registering incorrectly. ""What I found was state websites and local websites were usually extremely poorly run,"" she told CNN Tech. ""If I can find [bugs], certainly someone else can."" Twice a week, students pour into Berkeley's Hewlett Packard auditorium to learn how nation-state actors and cybercriminals hack into computer systems. By learning their methods, they can learn to try and stop them. In addition to government sites, students have also uncovered vulnerabilities in various apps, including from one a bank and shopping sites. One student made $100 after reporting a bug to the company. Related: Malware researcher helps teen hackers turn skills into careers Doug Tygar, the computer science professor who teaches the class, calls it an experiment. ""The goal is to train students to build super secure systems,"" Tygar told CNN Tech after a class. ""But in order to do that, they have to be able to think like a hacker."" The class works with HackerOne, a hacker-for-hire platform. Every bug a student finds is reported to the company or organization where it was found. Companies on the HackerOne platform pay hackers who find bugs in their systems. Most students target the companies that use the platform. Students also hear lectures and attend events hosted in partnership with HackerOne to learn from professional hackers.

Meanwhile, Ted Kramer, chief of staff at HackerOne, said the company wants to bring the program to more campuses. The class could help prepare students for future employment. According to a report from Cybersecurity Ventures, there will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide by 2021. Phan ultimately wants a job in security testing to help companies keep apps, websites and infrastructure secure. ""I find it much more rewarding than being a developer,"" she said."
"The so-called International Entrepreneur Rule was instituted to keep foreign entrepreneurs in the U.S. by giving them a workaround to existing visas. The Trump administration delayed the program's start in July just days before it was set to begin. Other countries, including France and Canada, offer special visas intended to encourage entrepreneurs to set up businesses there. Those who come to the U.S. and start companies must navigate a complicated web. Existing visas, like the H-1B, aren't intended for entrepreneurs and make it difficult to launch a company. The International Entrepreneur Rule would allow foreigners building ""fast-growing businesses"" to apply for ""parole status"" to work in the United States. In September, the National Venture Capital Association filed a lawsuit against DHS, arguing that Homeland Security needed to issue a formal ""notice-and-comment"" period before delaying the rule as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. On Friday, U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg formally agreed, ruling that DHS must ""dispense with its delay"" and begin accepting applications of those wishing to apply for the rule. Related: Trump is making it harder for immigrants to start businesses ""This decision is an important reminder that this administration must comply with the law and allow the public to have a voice during the agency rule making process,"" said Leslie K. Dellon, staff attorney at the American Immigration Council, in a statement. It's unclear how candidates can apply given that no application form has rolled out. When delaying the rule, DHS also expressed interest in rescinding the rule entirely. DHS did not immediately respond to request for comment. Under the Obama administration's rule, entrepreneurs must show that their young companies -- no more than five years old -- have the potential for ""rapid growth"" and job creation by way of government grants or at least $250,000 from qualified investors. The rule explicitly eliminates small businesses from consideration. Other requirements include the ability to operate legally in the country, and founders must own a minimum 10% stake in the firm. The Obama administration had expected about 2,940 applications under the rule each year. It would still be at the government's discretion who is granted acceptance as part of the new rule."
"Everyone knows the auto industry is changing. In the future, cars will run on electricity and they will drive themselves. Instead of owning cars, most people will just ride in them when they need to. Since all of this change is creating a ton of opportunity, lots of companies are pouring into the field. Companies like the ride-sharing firm Uber, electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) and Google's Waymo (GOOG), which is working on self-driving cars, all want a piece of the action. But on Thursday, GM announced plans to take the whole enchilada for itself: The automaker said it will make the cars, write the code and sell the rides. But can a 110-year-old automaker move fast enough to pull this off? In terms of electric cars, Tesla gets the bulk of the attention. But GM handily beat Tesla's ""affordable"" Model 3 to market with its own Chevrolet Bolt EV. Over 20,000 Bolt EV's have been sold so far this year. Tesla has a lot of orders but, at last count, has produced only a few hundred Model 3's while it struggles with production issues. GM has also been working with its subsidiary, Cruise Automation, to make self driving versions of the Bolt EV, which are being tested in California, Michigan, Arizona and, soon, New York. By some time in 2019, those driverless cars will start giving rides to passengers. That may seem awfully soon, but start-ups like Lyft and Waymo could be doing the same thing by then, too. GM's biggest advantage is that it well understands one of the biggest challenges: how to develop and manufacture cars with complex technology in huge numbers, said Sam Abuelsamid, a transportation analyst with Navigant Research. Besides the autonomous Bolts, GM already has Cadillac cars on the market that can drive hands-free on highways. Without drivers to pay or expensive gasoline to put in the tank, autonomous taxi rides will become much cheaper than today's taxi rides. That will make ride-sharing a much more compelling idea for consumers. But these cars won't just be giving rides. They will also be gathering data. Driverless cars are, in fact, voracious data gathering machines. They have radar, lasers, cameras and all sorts of sensors that can gather information that can be sent to server farms that never forget anything. And that data is valuable. One potential customer base, GM said Thursday, will be insurance companies. GM's cars will witness lots of fender benders and will be able to share that video with insurers to quickly settle claims. Other companies will buy the map data these cars produce and pay to place ads and offer services and games for bored passengers. The potential ways to make money are almost limitless, Abuelsamid said. Soon, just riding in a car becomes far cheaper and more convenient than owning one. This may seem like corporate suicide for a company that makes its money selling cars. But, according to GM, it's not. That's because under this new business model, instead of selling each car once, every vehicle it makes will generate a continuous stream of revenue."
"""I read 'Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret' by Judy Blume,"" said congresswoman Grace Meng, who represents Queens, New York. ""I think that's what informed me. So when I first got my period, I wasn't scared or didn't know what was happening to me."" Period Con, held in New York City last month, featured workshops and panels on various menstruation topics, from universalizing access to supplies in the workplace to dispelling the myth periods are dirty or ""unhygienic."" Meng and YouTube personality Ingrid Nilsen represent two types of so-called period activists. One is an advocate breaking conversational taboos about menstruation. Nilsen creates videos such as ""What Should You Use for Your Period?"" and ""Your Vagina Matters"" for her more than 1 million followers. She famously asked President Obama for his thoughts on the tampon tax. The other is a lawmaker pushing for systemic change. Meng has used her position to push for free menstrual products in jails and homeless shelters in New York City. She also introduced federal menstrual equity legislation earlier this year. Related: Men's health gets the Silicon Valley treatment Meng said she attributed her initial involvement in the movement to a high school student who wrote her a letter about the lack of menstruation products at homeless shelters. ""She educated me. It seems like such common sense, but maybe if she hadn't written to me or if you hadn't told your friend about this problem, it might not have been fixed,"" Meng told attendees. Period Con is the brainchild of Nadya Okamoto, a 19-year-old Harvard University student. She's also the cofounder of Period, a youth-run global nonprofit that provides menstrual products to those in need. At age 16, Okamoto saw first hand the lack of access to menstrual supplies for the homeless. Homeless herself for a period of time, Okamoto said some people resort to using unsanitary methods such as socks, toilet paper or brown paper bags. That can lead to health issues. Since founding Period in 2014, the organization has given out 190,000 ""period packs"" of supplies with the help of sponsors like U by Kotex, DivaCup and Lunette Cup. About five months ago, she had the idea for Period Con. It came as a way to ""unify"" members across the nonprofit's 130 university chapters in the U.S. She wanted to get the young activists together with academics, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders.  For Okamoto, Period Con was the next step to proving the legitimacy of the organization. ""Sometimes I am asked, 'Is your mom helping you with this?'"" Okamoto told CNNMoney. ""We were experiencing quite a lot of ageism, even with older activists. People would ask for the adults running the organization. We had to prove our potential."" In addition to finishing up college and running Period, Okamoto is writing a book about the menstruation movement. It's set to be published by Simon & Schuster in Fall 2018. Related: Period underwear brand Thinx names new CEO after HR issues The event's panels also touched on how brand marketing of period products often reinforce the gender binary. Some activists called on period brands to be mindful of packaging and language used so it is instead reflective of all people who menstruate, including some transgender people. While it's clear that there's a lot of room for progress, keynote speaker Carinne Chambers-Saini -- cofounder of DivaCup, a tampon alternative -- addressed how far the conversation has come. ""In 2017, a woman founding a company devoted to menstrual alternatives is described as brilliant,"" she told attendees. ""But as little as 10 years ago, we were described as insane."""
"Some have taken Musk's email to mean that his employees should forgive racist abuse from coworkers. Tesla released Musk's May 31 email in response to a lawsuit filed Monday that alleges racial discrimination and harassment at the company. The email, titled ""Doing the right thing,"" is a lengthy directive from Musk about how Tesla workers should treat each other. ""In fairness, if someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick-skinned and accept that apology,"" Musk wrote in part of the email. ""If you are part of a less represented group, you don't get a free pass on being a jerk yourself."" Though the email is not specific about what it means to be a ""jerk,"" Musk says employees should never ""intentionally allow someone to feel excluded, uncomfortable or unfairly treated."" He also notes that, ""Part of not being a huge jerk is considering how someone might feel who is part of an historically less represented group."" Musk added that Tesla has encountered a few cases in which people from underrepresented groups have been promoted over white colleagues but they nonetheless sued Tesla for discrimination, which Musk called ""obviously not cool."" Related: Tesla factory at center of discrimination lawsuits Portions of the email appeared Monday in a civil lawsuit that alleges racial discrimination and harassment at the company. A day later, Tesla posted the entire email on its website as part of a statement refuting the lawsuit's claims. The lawsuit was filed by Marcus Vaughn, who is black, and who worked at a Tesla production factory in California. Vaughn claimed that coworkers and supervisors regularly called him the n-word, and that the company -- including Musk -- was notified and did nothing to stop it. He also claimed he was fired last month for ""not having a positive attitude."" The excerpted email appears several pages into the complaint, where it is cited as an example of how Vaughn claimed Tesla allowed racial harassment to happen. ""In light of CEO Musk's message to employees that racist epithets can be directed 'unintentionally' and that it is 'important to be thick-skinned,' it is not surprising that the Tesla factory has become a hotbed for racist behavior,"" the lawsuit said. Tesla swiftly denied both the merits of the complaint and that characterization of Musk's email. In a blog post Tuesday, the company called the document a ""hotbed of misinformation"" and said Vaughn was a temporary worker who left after his contract ended. He contacted Musk while he worked there but did not mention racial discrimination, Tesla said. The company added that it investigated ""conflicting accusations and counter-accusations"" between black and Hispanic people who worked on or near Vaughn's team, and ultimately fired three people. Vaughn's attorney had no immediate comment. A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request. Tesla said Musk's email was intended to let workers know that ""no one should feel excluded, uncomfortable, or unfairly treated."" The blog post drew ire from Richard Lawler, a senior news editor at Engadget. ""Assigning people the responsibility of being 'thick-skinned' is labor they did not ask for,"" Lawler tweeted at Musk. Musk shot back: ""Do you really believe that someone's life should be ruined if they make a single offensive comment for which they then sincerely apologize?"" Do you really believe that someone's life should be ruined if they make a single offensive comment for which they then sincerely apologize?  Later Wednesday, Lawler tweeted that he is ""deeply interested in these stories of people who have had their lives ruined exclusively because a coworker didn't accept their apology for the only offensive comment they ever made."" I'm deeply interested in these stories of people who have had their lives ruined exclusively because a coworker didn't accept their apology for the only offensive comment they ever made.  ""He should recognize that encouraging an employee on a temporary contract to be 'thick-skinned' puts them in a nearly untenable position,"" Lawler told CNNMoney. ""A good policy would investigate the limitless other options available for dealing with harassment or offensive behavior in the workplace."" The Vaughn case, and the ensuing controversy, is not the first time Tesla has been accused of being hostile toward black workers. Four lawsuits have been filed in recent months that describe a toxic culture at the plant in Fremont, California, where Tesla makes its electric cars and where about 10,000 people work. Three employees claimed that the environment was so bad as to be ""straight from the Jim Crow era."" The company at the time told CNN Tech that while it takes all complaints seriously, ""in the history of Tesla, there has never been a single proven case of discrimination against the company. Not one."" --CNN Tech reporter Sara O'Brien contributed to this report."
"The company announced new guidelines for the verification program, and will remove verification from accounts that fall outside those rules. Tweeting content that incites hate and harassment, includes violent or dangerous behavior, or violates Twitter's rules, could lead to removal of the verification badge. Twitter's verification badge is a white check mark inside a blue icon next to someone's name indicating the company has verified the person's identity and that the account belongs to them. Celebrities, journalists, and popular personalities often receive the badge. So far, Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) has removed the verification from some prominent users. White nationalists Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler, controversial conservative commentator Laura Loomer, and a blogger known as @APurposefulWife all tweeted on Wednesday they had lost their verified status. Twitter also on Wednesday banned far-right figure Tim Gionet, known by his Twitter nickname Baked Alaska. Kessler, who organized ""Unite the Right"" protest in Charlottesville, criticized the policy in a tweet. ""Twitter has changed their verification policy just to be able to censor me,"" he said. Related: Twitter suspends blue check mark verifications Twitter verified Kessler last week and users immediately complained. ""Verifying white supremacists reinforces the increasing belief that your site is a platform for hate speech. I don't want to give up Twitter, but I may have to,"" tweeted comedian Michael Ian Black. ""Who do you value more, users like me or him?"" In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Twitter said the verification process has been misunderstood. ""Verification has long been perceived as an endorsement,"" the company tweeted. ""We gave verified accounts visual prominence on the service which deepened this perception. We should have addressed this earlier but did not prioritize the work as we should have."" Last week, the company suspended verification due to ""confusion"" over its policies. It is still not accepting public submissions for verification. Some Twitter users have criticized Twitter's decision not to remove some verified users from the platform for tweeting harassing content. Twitter previously said one factor it takes into consideration when removing content is the newsworthiness of the tweet, and it recently updated its policies to make that clearer. It's unclear why some Twitter users are losing their verification while others are removed from the site completely. Twitter declined to comment on that issue."
"Claire Schmidt -- vice president of film studio 21st Century Fox -- is stepping down from her current role to launch reporting tool AllVoices. The website intends to help employees anonymously report harassment, bias and discrimination directly to their CEO or company board. Susan Fowler, the former Uber engineer whose blog post about sexual harassment and sexism in the workplace opened a floodgate for stories of harassment in tech, will serve as an adviser. Investors include Tinder founder Sean Rad, theBoardlist founder Sukhinder Singh Cassidy and Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. The site is expected to launch in the next few weeks. Through the reporting portal, employees will answer questions aimed at identifying the nature of the problem, from sexual harassment to discrimination. The service will also encourage bystanders to report bad behavior. Related: Money, Power & Sexual Harassment in Silicon Valley All reports are anonymous so neither AllVoices or the company will know who is behind the tip. The platform does not ask for a name or email address, but it requires phone number verification. That data is encrypted to ensure security. ""We want all people at a company to feel empowered to drive the change they want to [see],"" Schmidt told CNN Tech. Many victims say they fear career repercussions and worry human resource departments are designed to benefit the business, rather than the employee. The tool aims to make employees feel comfortable leaving anonymous tips. AllVoices analyzes the anonymous reported data, identifies problems or patterns of bad behavior, and gives insights as to what's happening within a company. AllVoices will allow companies to access the service for free, but it will offer a premium option for details on the types of incidents reported. Businesses can also pay for specifically tailored actions plans and data to track progress. Pricing has not yet been disclosed. According to one investor, who asked not to be named, the idea is to give companies the tools to ""listen at scale"" and get boards to talk culture and business metrics. When asked whether employees would be incentivized to report harassment if the problem was coming from the top, the investor said it will be difficult for companies to ignore an issue if data exists around it. ""When we [talked] to CEOs and board members, [we noticed] they tend to hide behind the notion that they didn't know and start pointing fingers,"" the investor said. ""If you hear some of these things, and identify that it's a broader issue, it will command the issue and attention of the CEO."" If the CEO is the problem, ""there will be a fiduciary responsibility [for the company] to do something,"" the investor added. Schmidt's decision to launch the service follows years of work building tech to combat child sex trafficking online. Before 21st Century Fox (FOX), she worked at Thorn, a nonprofit that works with tech companies and law enforcement to come up with technical resources to stop abuse. Most recently, the organization launched a machine learning tool that helps investigators identify suspicious activity. Related: From harassment to boss issues, this startup helps with workplace woes The mission for Schmidt is personal. ""What's been happening to women in particular is something that hits really close to home,"" she wrote in a blog post. ""I'm a survivor of sexual assault."" She said she felt the responsibility to do more. ""[I have a] deep belief that technology and tools like these can make a real concrete difference in people's lives,"" said Schmidt. She turned to others in the industry to help. AllVoices investor Rad was a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed in 2014 by a former Tinder employee. The suit alleged Rad, then CEO, dismissed complaints about sexist comments in the workplace. Rad denied the allegations. The case was eventually settled. AllVoices isn't the only startup tackling harassment in the workplace. Some companies are partnering with Bravely, which matches employees with third-party HR staffers to listen to their issues and provide guidance. The effort intends to help employees get neutral consultants on how to handle issues at work."
"The government said Wednesday it would make it easier for foreign entrepreneurs to get licenses to launch startups in the kingdom, part of an effort to open up the economy and boost growth in its non-oil private sector. ""We hope that one of them, or more, will become a unicorn and reach a billion dollar evaluation. They are the Apples, Amazons and Googles of this world,"" said Ghassan Al Sulaiman, governor of the kingdom's Small and Medium Enterprise Authority. Unlike the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia has yet to produce a billion-dollar startup. (It is ranked 135th by the World Bank for starting a business). But tech plays a central role in its plan to wean itself off oil. Saudi Arabia is the biggest backer of a $100 billion tech fund launched with Japan's SoftBank (SFTBF). None of the cash has been invested yet in the Middle East because the region lacks startups large enough to attract big investors. Related: Saudi Arabia wants foreign help in its massive economic overhaul Preference for the fast track licenses will be given to those bringing patents, innovative services or a new business idea to Saudi Arabia. The first 11 entrepreneur licenses for startups were awarded on Wednesday at the Misk Global Forum, an annual event sponsored by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's philanthropic organization. Saudi Arabia has been trying to diversify its economy away from oil as part of its Vision 2030, a blueprint for what the economy should look like in the next decade. ""My project was inspired by the vision... I looked into it and the first pillar of the vision is a vibrant society,"" said Tatiana Vorobieva, a Russian entrepreneur who received one of the licenses. ""When you talk about a vibrant society, there is so much that the government can't do. It's about what the private sector, people and communities can do,"" she told CNNMoney.  Vorobieva moved to Saudi Arabia nearly two years ago with her husband. Her plan is to create an online platform to help students develop the skills Saudi Arabia will need as it overhauls its economy. With a license secured, Vorobieva is hopeful that she will soon receive funding to get her business off the ground and she'll be applying for money from a $10 million initiative announced Tuesday by Bill Gates and the Misk Foundation.

"In a lengthy Facebook post, Jurvetson said the reason for his departure from the venture capital firm he co-founded on Monday had nothing to do with ""sexual predation"" or ""workplace harassment."" ""How does one respond to accusations so serious that being innocent is not a good enough defense?"" he wrote. ""Let me be clear: no such allegations are true."" Jurvetson, 50, was a partner at prominent VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. He is also a board member and investor at Tesla and SpaceX, but as of Monday, he's currently on leave. According to Jurvetson, he left the firm ""because of interpersonal dynamics with my partners"" and ""stress."" In October, DFJ said it became aware of ""indirect and second-hand allegations"" about Jurvetson. The company launched an independent investigation, but it did not provide details on the allegations of misconduct. ""It is excruciating to learn just how quickly, in one news cycle, people conclude that because I have left DFJ there must be some credence to vicious and wholly false allegations about sexual predation and workplace harassment,"" wrote Jurvetson. He clarified that the DFJ investigation ""began not with a complaint, but with unsubstantiated rumors."" Jurvetson's departure comes on the heels of other investor resignations over misconduct allegations. 500 Startups cofounder Dave McClure and Binary Capital cofounder Justin Caldbeck left their respective firms this summer after multiple women came forward with allegations of workplace sexual harassment. Both men have issued apologies for their behavior. Related: Tesla board member leaves his firm amid misconduct While the women made their claims public about McClure and Caldbeck, there are no public claims against Jurvetson. ""The three-month investigation, that has yet to conclude (and I welcome the results whenever that takes place), broke down a normal team dynamic into factions that isolate communications and defer to the advice of lawyers,"" Jurvetson added. ""Add a modicum of stress (such as implied allegations in the press) and deadlines (our annual LP meeting is today), and people show a different side of their personality. I did. So did my partners. It's incredibly sad to see how things broke down, and the acrimony that arose between us."" Jurvetson also alluded to a ""personal relationship (one that doesn't involve employees, or prospective employees, or others in the workplace)"" as a contributing factor to his stress. ""I have also learned that an ill-advised relationship, where the other person is left feeling hurt, angry or scorned, can have far reaching consequences in the digital age,"" he wrote. ""It is inaccurate and unfair to describe any of this as harassment or predation."""
"Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) said Saturday that sales soared past $18 billion after just 13 hours of the retail blitz known as Singles Day, eclipsing the $17.8 billion it managed in the full 24 hours last year. Singles Day, a bonanza of online spending in China, has for years racked up more sales than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. Earlier in the day, Alibaba said eager shoppers had managed to spend $1 billion in just 2 minutes. As the clock struck midnight in Shanghai, the final sales tally rang in at $25,386,927,848, marking about a 40% increase over last year's record-setting sales total. Singles Day started out as an informal holiday in China celebrating single people on a day that epitomizes not being paired off: 11/11. Alibaba turned it into a festival of discount deals in 2009. Related: Black Friday 2017: When will the stores open? Alibaba has used the now-massive event to lure international companies onto its platforms. More than 40% of the brands taking part this year came from outside China, according to research firm eMarketer Retail. And while Singles Day still mostly targets Chinese consumers, it's also increasingly spreading to other countries, experts say. Local players in Southeast Asia like Lazada (an Alibaba subsidiary), Zalora and Shopee launched their own Singles Day promotions this year, said Xiaofeng Wang, an analyst with research firm Forrester. Related: It's not just Amazon: Chinese tech giants are selling groceries too The event is also evolving beyond its original conception as an online shopping spree. Alibaba and its main Chinese rival, JD.com, have both made significant investments in brick-and-mortar businesses. And they're using the popularity of Singles Day to drive shoppers to offline stores, too.  Cosmetics giant L'Oreal (LRLCF), for example, set up an interactive mirror at its Shanghai store where shoppers could try on virtual makeup using augmented reality and then order products on a touch screen linked to an Alibaba platform. But beyond the blockbuster sales, Singles Day also creates an enormous amount of waste. Greenpeace said the manufacturing, packaging and shipping linked to the event produced 258,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions last year. It would take about 2.6 billion trees to absorb it all. The environmental activist group estimates this year's shopping blitz is on track to leave an even bigger carbon footprint. ""More over-consumption means more CO2 emissions and waste,"" said Greenpeace campaigner Nie Li."
