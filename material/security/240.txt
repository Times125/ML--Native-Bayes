SINGAPORE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and the Netherlands' National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) on Tuesday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cyber security cooperation to formalize their commitment to work together to foster a secure cyber space. The agreement, which will last for an initial period of two years, commits both parties to regular bilateral exchanges, sharing of cyber security best practices and strategies aimed at protecting critical information infrastructures as well as access to training and workshops, said CSA in the press release. David Koh, Chief Executive of CSA, thought that it's important for the two countries to collaborate to enhance the security and resilience of cyberspace. "The Netherlands and Singapore share close ties and our countries are important hubs in areas such as maritime, aviation, telecommunications, banking and finance. A successful cyber-attack on any of these critical information infrastructures could have a knock-on effect on other critical infrastructures within the region and even globally," said Koh. Patricia Zorko, Deputy National Coordinator of Security and Counterterrorism and Head of the NCSC, stressed that both the two countries must look beyond national borders in order to achieve global cyber security; thus a close international cooperation is essential. "We both want to make full use of the opportunities of digital world and at the same time need to guard ourselves to its potential threats. This MOU paves the way for strengthening the cooperation between our countries in the field of cyber security," Zorko added.
