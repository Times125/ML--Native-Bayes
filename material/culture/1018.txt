Writer-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano had a hit in 2011 with their odd-couple heartwarmer Untouchable, starring Fran?ois Cluzet as the quadriplegic wheelchair-user who hires Omar Sy as his nurse. (The Hollywood remake of it, .) Now they are back with something machine-tooled to be an undemanding feelgood comedy. It stars the always formidable and dyspeptic Jean-Pierre Bacri as Max, the chief of a hospitality company in Paris that provides food, booze, music and service for super-classy parties of all sorts. He is just about tolerant of all the idiots and assholes that he employs, and indeed the idiots and assholes who form his customer base; his patience is tested to destruction when he takes on a massive job, a huge wedding reception party at an 18th-century chateau. It ends in farcical chaos, and his team seem determined on making his life as much of a nightmare as possible.The movie canters gamely along to the finish, and the ensemble players certainly work together with efficiency, but there is a note of silliness and basic-level unbelievability to almost everything that happens which undermines the comedy: the script isn t quite good enough to function as an alibi for its scene-by-scene implausibility, and the action isn t sufficiently credible to excuse the lack of really sharp gags. And for me, Bacri gets off to an odd, unsympathetic start when he yells at an impoverished young couple who are trying to reduce the cost of a fancy bash they have booked in an expensive  within sight of the Eiffel Tower. Are they supposed to be contemptible fools for worrying about money? Is he right to jeer at them? Where is the gag that could have answered these questions?Max shows up to supervise preparations for the big nuptial event at the country house to find everything in uproar. His co-director Josiane, played by Suzanne Cl ment (the ferocious mother in ), is having an affair with Max but mad at him for not committing; his mercurial manager Adele (Eye Haidara) is always screaming at the lounge singer they have hired: James (Gilles Lelouche). The photographer Guy (Jean-Paul Rouve) is a lazy complacent nincompoop who won t let guests take photos alongside him with their smartphones. The smug groom Pierre (Benjamin Lavernhe) isn t happy with anything and his bride Helena (Judith Chemla) is still carrying a torch for her gloomy ex, who is now temporarily employed as a waiter at this very same wedding. And it is Max s job to put out the brush-fires of hysterical incompetence that these people create. His maxim is:  We adapt There are one or two nice moments: I liked the running gag about Adele announcing deadpan that there is an outrageously nightmarish problem, waiting for Bacri to goggle at the horror of it all   and then reveal that she s kidding:  Your face!  It s the kind of setup which would work better as comfort-food television on a Sunday night, with more of a chance to invest in these dopey characters.
