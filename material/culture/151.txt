An early work derived from comic strips, this features Lichtenstein s recreation of the mass media s Ben-Day dots printing process. It would become one of the most recognisable 20th-century styles.The subject is as much the Girls  Romances comic the image came from as the mass production of images themselves.The artist has zoomed in on his source material, upping the drama of the man s predatory glance and the woman s hard gaze.Blown up to huge proportions and realised smoothly by the artist s invisible hand, Lichtenstein s beaus vibrate with the energy of the confident, capitalist postwar US., Lichtenstein s approach was the cool-headed antidote to the previous generation s heated way with paint.
