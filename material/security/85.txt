BRATISLAVA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Slovak Armed Forces specialists on information security are practising, along with international partners, defence against cyberspace attacks within the international exercise Locked Shields 2016. "Changes in the security environment and new forms of threat related to them require the adoption of new measures by the Slovak Armed Forces," announced Slovak Defence Minister Peter Gajdos on Thursday. Gajdos underlined the need for international cooperation, saying "In this information war, we're facing threats which go beyond normal state boundaries. Therefore we must be prepared to fight them together." According to Chief of General Staff Milan Maxim, the exercise is based on a scenario planned beforehand that focuses on training the security experts who protect national IT systems on a daily basis. Over 550 professionals and a total of 26 nations are involved in Locked Shields 2016 and teams are set to turn aside over 1,700 attacks. The defence exercise has been organised annually since 2010 by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.
