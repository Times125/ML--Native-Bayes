The network security market is entering its third generation, Fortinet CEO Ken Xie said. In a recent interview with CRN, Xie spoke about how he's seen the network security market evolve since he started his first security company and how he sees it evolving today, with demands for performance, integration, and automation at the forefront. With that shift, Xie said the market could see a shakeout of some of the market's biggest and best-known vendors, as he said competitors Cisco, Check Point and Palo Alto Networks all face challenges in the new generation. Here's what he had to say about what it takes to succeed in today's network security market, and what challenges the competition and his own company might face in the evolutions to come.
