His appointment was seen as an attempt to encourage the company to invest more in renewable energy. Magnin, however, said Hinkley Point and a proposal to buy Areva¡¯s reactor building unit showed EDF was actually moving further towards nuclear power.¡°As a board member proposed by the government shareholder, I no longer want to support a strategy that I do not agree with,¡± Magnin wrote in his letter to Jean-Bernard LšŠvy, which has been seen by Reuters. ¡°Let¡¯s hope that Hinkley Point will not drag EDF into the same abyss as Areva.¡±The French government had to rescue the nuclear group from bankruptcy earlier this year.The ?18bn project is controversial in the UK and France.
