Senate Republicans unveiled a "discussion draft" of their version of health care reform legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare Thursday morning, after setting aside the version of the bill the House passed last month.  With only a slim Republican majority in the Senate, any dissent in the GOP could lead to the failure of the legislation, known as the Better Care Act. Five Republican senators have already said they cannot vote for the legislation as it stands. The Senate bill appeared shortly after White House press secretary Sean Spicer and President Trump himself said the administration wants a bill with "heart." Mr. Trump on Thursday said the bill will need "a little negotiation, but it's going to be very good." He said he is "very supportive" of the bill. Here is how the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, differs from the House's American Health Care Act and how they both differ from what the Senate is offering.
