The federal government is weighing up how to eliminate toxic chemicals from firefighting foam linked to high-profile contamination scares, including a spill from a Qantas airport hangar into  waterways last week.It comes after a call by the  government for the commonwealth to follow its own ban on the chemicals PFOS and PFOA, which doesn t apply to Qantas because it operates on federal land.The state government released test results showing water in Boggy creek, the immediate site of , was now safe for  recreational use .The state environment minister, Steven Miles, said the results, which compared samples taken a day and a week after a spill that was linked to the deaths of about 20 fish nearby, were  encouraging .But test results for further waterways at the airport and Nudgee beach are pending and health authorities continue to urge people not to eat prawns or fish taken from the Brisbane river after the contamination.Prawn farmers are  from Qantas for business losses.Commercial fishers have said hundreds of kilograms of fish were caught in the area after the spill but it took five days for the peak body to be warned not to sell the product. The state environment department on Friday gave  an investigation notice ordering it to commission a report on  the source, cause and extent of any environmental harm .This included  strict instructions from the state regulator  to monitor sediment and marine life, Miles said.Miles, who has come under fire for his department taking three days to issue a public warning after it found out about the spill, urged the commonwealth to  take action to hold the polluter accountable for the contamination .This included using  their powers to determine the nature and extent of environmental contamination, and clean it up , he said.Miles wrote to the federal infrastructure minister, Darren Chester, on Wednesday asking the commonwealth to fast-track its removal of the foam from the airport and other federally owned sites in Queensland.Chester issued a statement on Friday saying the government was considering the  transitional removal  of PFOS and PFOA. The government is considering management options for PFOS and PFOA transitional removal from use, improved management and appropriate disposal of PFOS-containing firefighting foams at all facilities in Australia, consistent with the listing of the chemical under the Stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants,  he said.Queensland s acting chief health officer, Mark Elcock, said it was believed health risks were  low due to dilution, however until we have the full extent of results our health advice remains unchanged .  People still need to take a cautious approach,  he said.A Qantas spokesman said the airline takes this issue very seriously  and was already investigating tounderstand what occurred and how to prevent it from happening again .  We re also continuing to work with authorities to properly assess the impact of the spill.  There is  that PFOS and PFOA are harmful to human health but the  and there is not enough evidence to fully understand their impact.The alleged contamination of land near air force facilities that used foam containing PFOS and PFOA at Williamtown in New South Wales and Oakey in Queensland is the subject of .
