, Strange, but true. To qualify, we are sad to report, you will have to switch to another, bigger supplier. That s because the  is only available if you are supplied by a company that has at least 250,000 domestic customers. Good Energy has 55,000 electricity customers and therefore doesn t provide the incentive.Guardian Money is a big fan of Good Energy and its pledge to only sell electricity from renewable sources   often its own wind turbines. However,  140 is a lot to those on low incomes, so you must decide whether it s worth switching. If you do, but still want green electricity, Ovo Energy has a 100% renewables tariff and, crucially, is part of the warm homes scheme.
