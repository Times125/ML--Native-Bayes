I ve been playing this record for probably over a decade. It s pretty dark, but very sexual; usually when I ve played this, I know I ve played well. The beat isn t 4/4 time but, if you play it in the right moment, it works at every club.Just a huge track that gets everybody jumping. I heard  play it on the Amnesia terrace years ago and it was electric.I was introduced to this album by my first girlfriend. We woke up in the morning and she played it and it really blew my mind. That s probably the only good thing I remember about her.It s beautiful and very euphoric, I made an edit of this to play and added some drums. I was on a very bad date with someone that I realised I didn t like, and that song came up in conversation   she hated it   and I used it as an excuse to leave.It s just a beautiful track. It reminds me of my first time in Ibiza; I wish Ibiza still had afterparties with music like this, it s very balearic and I think it s probably Martin s best track.I played it during a sandstorm at  to about 100 people after a whole week of mental destruction and, when the drums came off, a lot of sand flew into everyone s eyes. It was an unforgettable moment.It all began with the Smiths for me, so I guess it has to end with them also.
