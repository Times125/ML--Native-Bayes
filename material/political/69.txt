Americans are divided over their opinions of media coverage of President Trump, according to a Gallup survey released Wednesday. The poll found 35 percent of people said the news media have been too tough on Mr. Trump, compared to 34 percent who said the coverage hasn't been tough enough. Twenty-eight percent, meanwhile, said that the news media's coverage of the president is "about right." More than three-quarters of Republicans said that the coverage has been too tough and 12 percent said it's about right. Fifty-three percent of Democrats said that the coverage hasn't been tough enough. People who were surveyed were asked if they lean toward Mr. Trump or the media in public disputes and slightly more Americans said they lean toward the media more. Nearly a third of people said they agree with neither side. The president, for his part, has denounced the "mainstream media's" coverage of him and his administration. On Wednesday morning, for example, he tweeted that stories that cite anonymous sources are "fake news," but that's far from the truth. Remember, when you hear the words "sources say" from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist. The poll surveyed 1,021 adults between July 5 and 9 with a four-percentage point margin of error.
