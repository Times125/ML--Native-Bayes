I was very sorry to learn that Jeremy Bullmore s workplace advice column (, 1 July) is coming to an end. Anyone who wants to understand what it is like to work in a late-capitalist, neoliberal world, and why British productivity is so poor, could do worse than read the endless complaints of frustrated careers and incompetent management that he has handled with such gentle wisdom. Perhaps his columns should be donated to a leading business school as a research archive? I wanted to thank Jeremy Bullmore for 12 years of his insightful column. It has been a valuable resource for me in understanding the world of work, and the personalities found within it. His guidance has frequently helped me achieve perspective when I read about someone in a similar situation to me, and reassured me that some problems are universal.The three scenarios he signed off with were spot-on; I can relate to each one he describes. These experiences are what spurred me on last year to become a workplace union rep, and speak up for others going through similar situations. Having the courage to call out bullying behaviour is the hardest thing to do at dark times, but it is the only way to come through the other side stronger.Workplaces can sometimes be a bear-pit, but Jeremy s column has been an inspiration, and I have kept his  few last thoughts  paragraphs as a starting point to resolve problems at work. All the best JB, we ll miss you.
