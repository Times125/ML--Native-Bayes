Oh, and it also might fly. "Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe..." Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tweeted Sunday. Musk had been Tweeting about a "special option package" for the Tesla Roadster that "takes it to the next level." He implied that the 1.9-second zero-to-60 times, which already beats the quickest cars now available by nearly half a second, could be improved upon with a future upgrade. "Just a question of safety," Musk said of the possible flight option. "Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities." Musk is also CEO of the rocket company SpaceX, although the enormous rockets SpaceX makes would obviously be very different from ones that would launch a car off the pavement. A number of companies are working on "flying cars" which, for the most part, amount to road-worthy airplanes that could legally be driven on streets. Musk seems to be talking about something different, a sports car that could "hop" over obstacles. The emphasis would, presumably, still be on performance and practicality with four wheels on the ground. The Roadster was revealed as a surprise addition during the same Thursday night event at which Tesla unveiled its electric semi-truck.
