ack in the 1990s, there was a major pop culture war in which it was impossible to not take sides, and the side you took revealed what kind of person you were. What? – Blur v Oasis? Friends v Frasier? Get out of town. We’re talking, of course, about the 1998 asteroid-disaster-movie war, in which you were either lovely emosh Deep Impact (yay!) or loud explodey Armageddon (boo!). Nineteen years later, and we’re all going to get the chance to relive those thrilling times as the world readies itself for not one, but two battle-rap films in quick succession.The filmic dust-up is also a transatlantic affair.
