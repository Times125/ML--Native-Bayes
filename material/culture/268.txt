The orchestra has a powerful engine that always feels on the verge of breaking loose, but Ticciati harnesses the depth and drive of that energy and adds some gorgeously febrile stuff. Maybe some of the corners aren t as nimble as they ll become a few years into his new job, but Faur s Prelude to Penelope surges and sweeps, Debussy s Pell as and M lisande suite has a rich, sombre beauty and La Mer sounds robust, brooding and vast. Magdalena Ko?en  sings Debussy s Ariettes Oubli es (as orchestrated by Brett Dean) with a steely grandeur.
