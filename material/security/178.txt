LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Two thirds of major businesses in Britain had been hit by cyber breaches or attacks in the past year, a government report revealed Sunday. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) urged businesses to better protect themselves from cyber criminals. Government research published today revealed nearly seven out of 10 attacks on all firms involved viruses, spyware or malware, with research into cyber security finding two thirds of large businesses experienced a cyber breach or attack in the past year. Digital Economy Minister, MP Ed Vaizey said: "The UK is a world-leading digital economy and this government has made cyber security a top priority. Too many firms are losing money, data and consumer confidence with the vast number of cyber attacks." A study by the government has found that almost half of the top FTSE 350 businesses regarded cyber attacks as the biggest threat to their business when compared with other key risks, up from 29 per cent in 2014. Many firms are, says DCMS, getting better at managing cyber risks, with almost two thirds now setting out their approach to cyber security in their annual reports.
