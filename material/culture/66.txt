 soundtrack for the resistance  is how this collective, featuring members of , are selling their debut album. While hitching their wagon to the rebellious sentiment that has flared in the US following the election of Donald Trump is certainly a savvy marketing move, it s difficult to imagine millions marching on Washington to the sounds of this reheated 20-year-old rap-rock. Nothing here comes remotely close to the levels of sonic and lyrical urgency that first bubbled up on RATM s self-titled debut or Public Enemy s It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. Lyrically there s a sense of slovenliness to the sloganeering, with lines that are meant to feel rousing    Stand up and rise like the tide  on Unfuck the World   seeming instead rather boilerplate. Occasionally, a hint of past glories glint through   as when Chuck D compares Trump to another headline-grabbing, race-baiting politician with the droll line  By George, he s the new Wallace  (on Hail to the Chief)   but for the most part this is a revolution that feels sanitised.
