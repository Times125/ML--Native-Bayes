Longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks will serve as interim White House communications director until a permanent replacement is found for the job, the White House announced today. "Hope Hicks will work with White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and all of the communications team and serve as the Interim White House Communications Director," a White House official said in a statement. "We will make an announcement on a permanent communications director at the appropriate time." A senior administration official had confirmed to ABC News earlier in the day that Hicks, 28, will assume the role vacated most recently by Anthony Scaramucci, who served in the position for 11 days. In addition to Scaramucci's short tenure, the White House communications office has seen multiple shakeups in recent months, with White House press secretary Sean Spicer resigning from his position when Scaramucci was hired. Spicer had also been unofficially filling the role of communications director since the departure of former Communications Director Mike Dubke, who resigned from the role after a three-month stint. Hicks, one of the president's closest advisers, has served as director of strategic communications in the White House and was by Donald Trump's side throughout the 2016 presidential campaign as his spokeswoman.
