 (, ) goes for the grey pound once again with this well-meaning tale of the unlikely intergenerational friendship between Queen Victoria (Judi Dench, regal as ever and clearly having a blast) and an Indian servant named Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal). Abdul is  the tallest man here  and so is shipped from Agra to England to present Her Majesty with a ceremonial coin in celebration of the golden jubilee.  I thought the tall one was terribly handsome,  says the Queen, and so Abdul is promoted from bearer of wobbling royal jellies (the symbolism isn t lost on me) to her personal footman and, eventually, her  munshi  or spiritual guide.Dench s Victoria learns  Indian  (Urdu is deemed more queenly than  Hindustani ), while an enthusiastic Abdul teaches her about the joys of mangoes and the spiritual significance of carpets. ( Life is like a carpet; we weave in and out to make a pattern,  he says.)  She ll be wearing a burqa next,  mutters Lord Salisbury (Michael Gambon).Dench is captivating as the cantankerous queen, but Fazal isn t able to flesh out Abdul, who is thinly sketched on the page. An asexual  Uncle Tom  crawling up  the stinky, creaking ladder of the shitty British empire , according to friend and comic foil Mohammed (Adeel Akhtar). The film takes great pains to absolve Victoria of colonial responsibility, painting her, bizarrely, as tolerant and reviled for it.  I m hated all over the world and here,  she insists, describing herself as a  fat, lame, silly, impotent old woman  hankering  to be oneself and live a simple, rudimentary life . This kind of historical revisionism is a stretch that, at best, works as a cute royalist fantasy and, at worst, dresses up its endorsement of colonialism and empire as something progressive.
