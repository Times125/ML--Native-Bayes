"As the US comes to terms with its second major weather disaster within a month, an important question is whether the devastation caused by hurricanes  and  will convince Donald Trump and his administration of the reality of climate change.The president＊s luxurious Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida may escape Irma＊s wrath, but with the deaths of so many Americans, and billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses, the costs of climate change denial are beginning to pile up at the door of the White House.Just days before Harvey formed in the Atlantic last month,  introduced by his predecessor Barack Obama, to help American communities and businesses become more resilient against the risks of flooding, which are rising because of climate change.But the merciless assault on the US mainland by Harvey and Irma should be forcing the president to recognise the consequences of his arrogance and complacency in dismissing the research and analysis carried out by scientists.The flooded streets of Houston and the wind-ravaged homes of south Florida bear the unmistakable fingerprint of extreme weather made worse by manmade greenhouse gas emissions.A hurricane is a huge, rotating cluster of thunderstorms that forms above a sea surface that has a temperature of at least 26.5C. It is like a giant engine, transferring heat from the sea surface up into the atmosphere and generating strong winds and heavy rain in the process.The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from 1 June until 30 November, and typically produces 12 tropical storms, of which six reach hurricane strength 每 with sustained wind speeds of more than 73mph. There have been 11 storms so far this year, including six hurricanes. In early August, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration raised its prediction for the season to ※above normal§, suggesting that the final tally could be up to 19 storms, with nine of them hurricanes.But this season has already been remarkable in one respect because two major hurricanes, with sustained winds of more than 110mph, have hit the US mainland, after a period of 12 years when none of the strongest storms made American landfall. has also set records for being the strongest hurricane to have occurred in the open Atlantic, and for having sustained wind speeds of at least 185mph over the longest period. cannot be blamed for the hurricane count in any single season, nor for the occurrence of any single storm, but there are three ways in which it is making the consequences worse.First, although the intensity of a hurricane depends on many factors, warmer seawater tends to promote stronger storms. Average sea surface temperatures have been rising, and some parts of the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are warmer than average at the moment, which is a key reason why both Harvey and Irma became so strong so quickly.Second, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour, which can result in heavier rainfall. That is true not only for hurricanes but also for weaker storms across the world. Even relatively mild tropical storms can cause great damage by dropping huge volumes of rain over one area.Third, apart from strong winds and heavy rainfall, hurricanes cause damage through storm surges as their winds push seawater ahead of them. Storm surges can inundate extensive low-lying coastal areas, sweeping away everything in their path. Sea levels have been gradually rising globally, making storm surges bigger and deadlier.Scientists are still not sure about the other ways in which climate change may be impacting hurricanes. The main reason Harvey created such extreme flooding around Houston was that it stalled over the city and dumped rain for several days without moving on. We do not know if climate change played a role in creating the atmospheric conditions that made that happen.Nor can we yet predict whether climate change will affect the number of hurricanes that occur every year. Some studies have suggested that while numbers will drop, strengths will increase.Also uncertain is how natural climate variability affects hurricanes. Numbers have increased markedly in the North Atlantic since the 1990s, but this seems to be due, at least partly, to large-scale changes in ocean circulation that occur over many years or decades.However, it is clear that the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans will be at risk if Trump and his administration continue to deny the existence of climate change and its impact on the threat posed by hurricanes."
"any of us share some dim apprehension that the world is flying out of control, that the centre cannot hold. Raging wildfires, once-in-1,000-years storms and lethal heatwaves have become fixtures of the evening news 每 and all this after the planet has warmed by less than 1C above preindustrial temperatures. But here＊s where it gets really scary.If humanity burns through all its fossil fuel reserves, there is the potential to warm the planet by as much as 18C and raise sea levels by hundreds of feet. This is a warming spike of an even greater magnitude than that so far measured for the end-Permian mass extinction. If the worst-case scenarios come to pass, today＊s modestly menacing ocean-climate system will seem quaint. Even warming to one-fourth of that amount would create a planet that would have nothing to do with the one on which humans evolved or on which civilisation has been built. The last time it was 4C warmer there was no ice at either pole and sea level was 80 metres higher than it is today.I met University of New Hampshire paleoclimatologist Matthew Huber at a diner near his campus in Durham, New Hampshire. Huber has spent a sizable portion of his research career studying the hothouse of the early mammals and he thinks that in the coming centuries we might be heading back to the Eocene climate of 50 million years ago, when there were Alaskan palm trees and alligators splashed in the Arctic Circle.※The modern world will be much more of a killing field,§ he said. ※Habitat fragmentation today will make it much more difficult to migrate. But if we limit it below 10C of warming, at least you don＊t have widespread heat death.§In 2010, Huber and his co-author, Steven Sherwood, published one of the most ominous science papers in recent memory, ※Lizards will be fine, birds will be fine,§ Huber said, noting that life has thrived in hotter climates than even the most catastrophic projections for anthropogenic global warming. This is one reason to suspect that the collapse of civilisation might come long before we reach a proper biological mass extinction. Life has endured conditions that would be unthinkable for a highly networked global society partitioned by political borders. Of course we＊re understandably concerned about the fate of civilisation and Huber says that, mass extinction or not, it＊s our tenuous reliance on an ageing and inadequate infrastructure, perhaps, most ominously, on power grids, coupled with the limits of human physiology that may well bring down our world.In 1977, when power went out for only one summer day in New York, swaths of the city devolved into something like Hobbes＊s man in a state of nature. Riots swept across the city, thousands of businesses were destroyed by looters and arsonists lit more than 1,000 fires.In 2012, when the monsoon failed in India (as it＊s expected to do in a warmer world), 670 million people 每 that is, 10% of the global population 每 lost access to power when the grid was crippled by unusually high demand from farmers struggling to irrigate their fields, while the high temperatures sent many Indians seeking kilowatt-chugging air-conditioning.※The problem is that humans can＊t even handle a hot week today without the power grid failing on a regular basis,§ he said, noting that the ageing patchwork power grid in the United States is built with components that are allowed to languish for more than a century before being replaced. ※What makes people think it＊s going to be any better when the average summer temperature will be what, today, is the hottest week of the year in a five-year period and the hottest temperatures will be in the range that no one has ever experienced before in the United States? That＊s 2050.§By 2050, according to a , there will also be five billion people living in water-stressed areas.※Thirty to 50 years from now, more or less, the water wars are going to start,§ Huber said.In their book , Penn State＊s Lee Kump and Michael Mann describe just one local example of how drought, sea level rise and overpopulation may combine to pop the rivets of civilisation:※Increasingly severe drought in West Africa will generate a mass migration from the highly populous interior of Nigeria to its coastal mega-city, Lagos. Already threatened by rising sea levels, Lagos will be unable to accommodate this massive influx of people. Squabbling over the dwindling oil reserves in the Niger river delta, combined with potential for state corruption, will add to the factors contributing to massive social unrest.§※Massive social unrest§ here being a rather bloodless phrase masking the utter chaos coming to a country already riven by corruption and religious violence.※It＊s sort of the nightmare scenario,§ said Huber. ※None of the economists is modelling what happens to a country＊s GDP if 10% of the population is refugees sitting in refugee camps. But look at the real world. What happens if one person who was doing labour in China has to move to Kazakhstan, where they aren＊t working? In an economic model, they＊d be immediately put to work. But in the real world, they＊d just sit there and get pissed. If people don＊t have economic hope and they＊re displaced, they tend to get mad and blow things up. It＊s the kind of world in which the major institutions, including nations as a whole, have their existence threatened by mass migration. That＊s where I see things heading by mid-century.§And it doesn＊t get any better after 2050. But forecasts about the disintegration of society are social and political speculations and have nothing to do with mass extinctions. Huber is more interested in the hard limits of biology. He wants to know when humans themselves will actually start to disintegrate. His 2010 paper on the subject was inspired by a chance meeting with a colleague.※I presented a paper at a conference about how hot tropical temperatures were in the geological past and [University of New South Wales climate scientist] Steve Sherwood was in the audience. He heard my talk and he started asking himself the very basic question: ＆How hot and humid can it get before things start dying?＊ It was literally just an order of magnitude kind of question. I guess he thought about it and realised that he didn＊t know the answer and wasn＊t sure anyone else did either＃ Our paper really wasn＊t motivated by the future climate per se, because when we started we didn＊t know if there was any kind of realistic future climate state that would fall within this habitability limit. When we started, it was just like, ＆We don＊t know. Maybe you have to go to, like, 50C global mean temperature.＊ Then we ran a whole set of model results and it was rather alarming to us.§Sherwood and Huber calculated their temperature thresholds using the so-called wet-bulb temperature, which basically measures how much you can cool off at a given temperature. If humidity is high, for instance, things like sweat and wind are less effective at cooling you down and the wet-bulb temperature accounts for this.※If you take a meteorology class, the wet-bulb temperature is calculated by basically taking a glass thermometer, putting it in a tight wet sock and swinging it around your head,§ he said. ※So when you assume that this temperature limit applies to a human, you＊re really kind of imagining a gale force wind, blowing on a naked human being, who＊s doused in water, and there＊s no sunlight, and they＊re immobile and actually not doing anything other than basal metabolism.§Today, the most common maximums for wet-bulb temperatures around the world are 26C to 27C. Wet-bulb temperatures of 35C or higher are lethal to humanity. Above this limit, it is impossible for humans to dissipate the heat they generate indefinitely and they die of overheating in a matter of hours, no matter how hard they try to cool off.※So we were trying to get across the point that physiology and adaptation and these other things will have nothing to do with this limit. It＊s the easy-bake oven limit,§ he said. ※You cook yourself, very slowly.§What that means is that this limit is likely far too generous for human survivability.※When you do real modelling, you hit a limit much sooner, because human beings aren＊t wet socks,§ he said. According to Huber and Sherwood＊s modelling, 7C of warming would begin to render large parts of the globe lethally hot to mammals. Continue warming past that and truly huge swaths of the planet currently inhabited by humans would exceed 35C wet-bulb temperatures and would have to be abandoned. Otherwise, the people who live there would be literally cooked to death.※People are always like, ＆Oh, well, can＊t we adapt?＊ and you can, up to a point,§ he said. ※It＊s just after that point that I＊m talking about.§Already in today＊s world, heated less than 1C above preindustrial times, heatwaves have assumed a new deadly demeanour. . It was called a once-in-500-year event. It happened again three years later (497 years ahead of schedule). In 2010, a heatwave killed 15,000 people in Russia. In  alone from a heatwave that struck Pakistan while many were fasting for Ramadan. But these tragic episodes are barely a shade of what＊s projected.※In the near term 每 2050 or 2070 每 the US Midwest is going to be one of the hardest hit,§ said Huber. ※There＊s a plume of warm, moist air that heads up through the central interior of the US during just the right season and, man, is it hot and sticky. You just add a couple of degrees and it gets really hot and sticky. These are thresholds, right? These aren＊t just like smooth functions. It gets above a certain number and you hurt yourself very badly.§China, Brazil, and Africa face similarly infernal forecasts, while the already sweltering Middle East has what Huber calls ※existential problems§. The first flickers of this slow-motion catastrophe might be familiar to Europeans struggling to accommodate the tens of thousands of refugees at their borders: the collapse and  came after a punishing four-year drought. Still others have noted that the Hajj, which brings two million religious pilgrims to Mecca each year, will be a physically impossible religious obligation to fulfil due to the limits of heat stress in the region in just a few decades.But for the very worst-case emissions scenarios, heatwaves would not merely be a public health crisis or a ※threat multiplier§, as the Pentagon calls global warming. Humanity would have to abandon most of the Earth it now inhabits. In their paper, Huber and Sherwood write: ※If warmings of 10C were really to occur in the next three centuries, the area of land likely rendered uninhabitable by heat stress would dwarf that affected by rising sea level.§Huber said: ※If you ask any schoolchild, ＆What were mammals doing in the age of the dinosaurs?＊ they＊d say they were living underground and coming out at night. Why? Well, heat stress is a very simple explanation. Interestingly, birds have a higher set-point temperature 每 ours is 37C, birds＊ is more like 41C. So I actually think that＊s a very deep evolutionary relic right there. Because that wet-bulb temperature was probably maxing out around 41C in the Cretaceous, not 37C.§Back at the diner in New Hampshire, Huber told me about his ※favourite story§: the US Army＊s real-life parable of the so-called Motivated Point Man. In 1996, a platoon of light infantry spent days in the Puerto Rican jungle acclimatising to stifling heat and humidity, cautiously monitoring their water intake before simulating a night-time raid. The platoon included ※some of the most fit and motivated soldiers in the battalion§. When the evening of the raid came, the platoon leader began leading his troops through the jungle, machete-ing a path through the brush. Before long, he was felled by fatigue and delegated his leadership to an underling. When the second private failed to advance the platoon quickly enough, the platoon leader demanded to lead again. But soon he found himself hyperthermic and unable to walk. His soldiers had to douse him in cold water and supply him with intravenous infusions. Eventually, four soldiers had to carry him. Before long, the extra demands vitiated the entire platoon, all of whom began to fall prey to heat stress. The exercise had to be called off before it became a massacre.※So I look at that as, if it＊s night-time and acclimatised, fit people can just disintegrate into a pool of useless people on stretchers. That＊s what I see happening to society, to cultures,§ Huber said. ※If you want to know how mass extinctions happen, that＊s how. So when people talk about the Pleistocene megafauna extinctions and Clovis people, sometimes they act like it＊s a mystery how these things happen. But it happens in exactly the same way. You have something tearing apart the strongest members, the weaker ones try to fill in the gaps, they＊re really not strong enough to take it and the whole thing collapses.※You want to know how societies collapse?§ Huber said. ※That＊s how.§ As temperatures increase beyond preindustrial levels, widespread extinction of amphibians begins.As warming causes ice sheets to melt, krill populations suffer, threatening the penguins＊ main food source.About half of wooded tundra is lost, putting pressure on its inhabitants such as moose, lynx and brown bears.At warming just over the +2C limit agreed in Paris 25% of large mammals in Africa are extinct.Major loss of tropical rainforests and the species that depend on them for habitat, including orangutans, sloths and jaguars.At these temperatures, up to 70% of species would be extinct, coral reefs would be dead and deserts would expand across the globe."
"ave you ever seen a headless toad? If the answer is no, now is a good time to go out looking for one. You see, it is almost exactly at this time of year that they are becoming headless thanks to the actions of tiny parasites that are emerging from out of their bodies. It is with these creatures that I would like to begin this piece about the worthiness or worthlessness of parasites.The toadfly  is a small, nondescript fly not unlike a bluebottle. In spring it anoints a chosen toad with some eggs, which it lays on the toad＊s nose. The maggots that come forth from these eggs climb into the toad＊s nostrils, where they begin to eat its nasal passages along with its eyes and brain before bursting forth from the toad＊s head, all at once, later in the year. The result is a headless toad torso. Look out for them.How do the maggots know when to emerge en masse from the toad＊s head? The answer is that, as the maggots grow, they become primed like a bomb. They become temperature-sensitive. They use the toad＊s cold-bloodedness against it, activating a mass migration from the toad＊s head when temperatures regularly drop below 14C ＃ or about now.At the exact moment you read this, thousands of toads are walking around in the countryside with a ticking time bomb in their head. Primed like this, each toad becomes the bomb-laden bus that must not drive slower than 50mph  每 except the passengers are the bad guys. And the passengers are obsessed with the weather. And there are thousands of buses.As weird as it sounds, I＊ve become a big fan of toadflies. The same goes for mites, protozoa, worms, fleas and ticks. Parasites are de rigueur for life on Earth. It was only a matter of time before a group of scientists would have the gall to call for their conservation. This happened on Wednesday, opening up an interesting area of ethical debate about whether such animals as worms and ticks are worth saving. used parasite specimens from the Smithsonian Institution＊s Museum of National History to map out the survival fortunes of 457 parasites from across the world. By applying a range of climate models to these species it was discovered that, as an average, we may lose 10% of our global parasite diversity by 2070. If you include host creatures, many of which are facing extinction, the number of threatened parasite species skyrockets to one in three. The hangers-on are only just hanging on, it seems, and so our parasite friends may come to need us more than ever, to ensure their survival.Can we learn to love them, I wonder, particularly when they so often appear to cause such pain and suffering to other creatures? Sure, we could do without the parasites that cause intense distress to humans and their livestock and pets, but what about the rest? Would this be a poorer world without the humble toadfly? Or the ? Or the flatworm larvae, which  so that they can be eaten by birds, the only host in which the adult flatworm can mate? Or the ? Would we even notice if creatures like these disappeared overnight?The answer, as scientists are increasingly coming to understand, is yes, very probably. In many habitats on Earth, parasitism probably exceeds predation (preying on other species) as a means of acquiring energy for new life. In estuarine habitats, for instance, the number of parasitic trematode worms is . They have become the biomass upon which other things feed. In a curious sort of way, these creatures are now the life-givers.There are other examples. On some oceanic islands, the lice and ticks and fleas that seabirds bring with them provide life-giving sustenance to scorpions, lizards and spiders, . In a series of tests involving experimental grass plots in the US, the bulk of the biomass feeding on the grass didn＊t come from the herbivores above ground, but rather from the parasitic fungus below.The more we study parasites, they more we understand their value to ecosystems. They are not passengers within buses, in other words, but buses within bigger buses. And so I am happy to welcome parasites to the conservation debate.Though we may feel uncomfortable with having to include them, in time I suspect we will come to realise that they have a part to play, one that has gone overlooked and unrecognised. With more research, perhaps we will come to see the best of ourselves in them. Energy harvesters. Ecological dynamos. Bringers of life. Or perhaps they have new things to teach us, like how better we might use the planet＊s resources without anyone ever really noticing we were there. The true parasite-way.

"One of the world＊s largest marine protection areas has been created off the coast of Easter Island.The 740,000 sq km marine park is roughly the size of the Chilean mainland and will protect at least 142 endemic marine species, including 27 threatened with extinction.An astonishing 77% of the Pacific Ocean＊s fish abundance occurs here and recent expeditions .Apex predators found in the conservation zone include scalloped hammerhead sharks, minke, humpback and blue whales, and four species of sea turtle.Matt Rand, the director of the Pew Bertarelli ocean legacy project, which campaigned for the park, said: ※This marine reserve will have a huge global significance for the conservation of oceans and of indigenous people＊s ways of life.※The Rapa Nui have long suffered from the loss of timber, declining ecosystems and declining populations. Now they are experiencing a resurgence based on ensuring the health of the oceans.§Plans for the marine park were , at which the former US president Barack Obama declared his ※special love for the ocean§ in a video message. The plans were confirmed in a speech by Chilean president Michelle Bachelet on Saturday.The marine park＊s creation was enabled by a 73% vote in favour of the conservation zone from Easter Island＊s 3,000 Rapa Nui population in a referendum on 3 September, after five years of consultations.Extractive industries and industrial fishing will be banned inside the reserve, but the Rapa Nui will be allowed to continue their traditional artisanal fishing on small boats, using hand lines with rocks for weights.Ludovic Burns Tuki, the director of the Mesa del mar coalition of more than 20 Rapa Nui groups, said: ※This is a historic moment 每 a great and beautiful moment for the Rapa Nui, for the world and for our oceans.※We think this process can be an example for the creation of other marine reserves that we need to protect our oceans 每 with a respect for the human dimension.§After the creation of a comparable marine protection area  last year, ＊ waters could soon create a protected area of more than 2m sq km. This would have a unifying potential for the Polynesian people, according to Burns Tuki.※The ocean is very important to us as a source of food, but the Polynesians were great navigators and the ocean also represents our mother,§ he said. ※It enables us to move with a double canoe between the different islands. It gives us everything.§As global warming takes hold, some scientific papers suggest that marine reserves may also help  and provide .

"As recovery begins on the islands of the Caribbean and Florida braces itself for an onslaught, Irma has stormed into the record books as the most powerful . But such weather systems are far from a rarity. Hurricanes are a type of storm known as a tropical cyclone, which build from warm, moist air over the oceans. Water evaporates, leaving behind a region of low pressure, which is then filled by surrounding air, explains Adrian Champion, an expert in climate systems from the University of Exeter. This causes more ※new§ warm air to rise into the cyclone, he explains. As this warm, moist air cools, it forms clouds, releasing energy back into the cyclone, helping it to develop. Such systems form in the tropics as the water is warmer than elsewhere, therefore more easily evaporated. The ※spin§ of the hurricane is down to the rotation of the Earth affecting the movement of the air: since Irma formed north of the equator, it spins anticlockwise.Many different factors can cause the system to build. ※What causes it to intensify [beyond a standard cyclone] is either that the ocean is unusually warm or there is further instability [such as strong winds] in the atmosphere,§ said Champion.Depending on where these systems strike, they are given different names. ※If they hit the Americas then they are called hurricanes, if they hit Asia they are called typhoons and if they hit Africa and Australia they are called cyclones,§ said Champion. But it is when these severe storms head towards land that interest generally gathers pace 每 a factor that has led to hurricanes and other tropical cyclones being given specific monikers to avoid confusion and help the public and the media to share information. The names themselves are allocated based on a system devised by the World Meteorological Organization 每 if a tropical cyclone is particularly deadly, as in the case of Hurricane Katrina, its handle will not be used again.The strength of a hurricane is marked by its category on what is known as the Saffir-Simpson scale, which reflects the wind speeds 每 and hence the level of damage expected once the cyclone strikes land. While category 1 hurricanes are serious, expected to damage rooftops and bring down trees with wind speeds between 74 and 95mph,  was initially at the top end of the scale, meeting criteria for a category 5 hurricane: winds of 157mph or more, catastrophic damage, power outages that could last for many weeks, and areas of land rendered uninhabitable for months. But drastic though Irma is, one thing is for sure: the storm will pass.※The big thing is [hurricanes] only have this energy supply when they are over the oceans,§ said Champion. ※When they hit landfall they weaken and die away.§"
"he road climbs and thins with each turn. Where it reaches a little fist of cottages it doesn＊t stop but instead, strangely, has its way blocked from waist height up by low branches. A dead road, leading to the old reservoir. I walk a footpath bordered by stone walls, then over a stile and here it is, a sweep of miniature country. A rumpled slope, trees fat with summer, a little pond catching the sky. August dew sits on everything, and early sun lights every drop to a shimmer. I see rabbits, molehills, every bush twitching with life.I live less than a mile from here and would come to this meadow more, but for one thing. The air is awash with it, a roar that wavers only slightly, and never below uncomfortable. It＊s rush hour now, so maybe this is as bad as it gets. But it never goes away.Wothorpe-on-the-Hill is next to the A1. You don＊t see it. But you hear it, constantly. A raised road, four lanes, trucks, cars: it＊s tragic. A plague on this little place, under siege by a maddening local noise. I walk by the wall, past ancient woodworm-pitted stumps, towards , built in 1615, abandoned in 1700 and now a turreted husk, like a fantasy folly, or Du Maurier＊s Manderley. It＊s an impassive witness to the change before it: how much quieter this scene must have been. In The Silence Afterwards the Norwegian poet Rolf Jacobsen wrote of That title might need inverting to The Silence Before to resonate here.Noise might, should, be the next big environmental thing: it＊s blamed for learning disorders, hypertension, insomnia, dementia. Tranquillity is shrinking. People are forgetting what silence feels like. Back in the meadow. I walk to the little pond: it sits under a circle of trees, within a sea of nettles. I notice the nettles are covered in little snails. Snails are deaf. But vibrations they can feel. A breeze passes, quivers the dew-hung trees, and the whole area awakens with a cool, organic crackle-static as the water falls onto the nettles. Just for a second, I hear just this."
"hen I was small, I decided I wanted to be a naturalist. And so I slowly amassed a nature collection, and arranged it across my bedroom sills and shelves as a visible display of all the small expertises I＊d gathered from the pages of books. There were galls, feathers, seeds, pine cones, loose single wings of small tortoiseshell or peacock butterflies picked from spiders＊ webs, the severed wings of dead birds, spread and pinned on to cardboard to dry, the skulls of small creatures, pellets 每 tawny owl, barn owl, kestrel 每 and old bird nests. One was a chaffinch nest I could balance in the palm of a hand, a thing of horsehair and moss, pale scabs of lichen and moulted pigeon feathers; another a song thrush nest woven of straw and soft twigs with a flaking inner cup moulded from clay. But those nests never felt as if they fitted with the rest of my beloved collection. It wasn＊t that they conjured the passing of time, of birds flown, of life in death. Those intuitions are something you learn to feel much later in life. It was partly because they made me feel an emotion I couldn＊t name, and mostly because I felt I shouldn＊t possess them at all. Nests were all about eggs, and eggs were something I knew I shouldn＊t ever collect. Even when I came across a white half-shell picked free of twigs by a pigeon and dropped on a lawn, a moral imperative stilled my hand. I could never bring myself to take it home.I was raised at a time when the set of acceptable amateur bird-appreciation activities had shrunk to watching, feeding and counting them. Naturalists of the 19th and early 20th centuries had routinely collected birds＊ eggs, and most children who grew up in semi-rural or rural surroundings in the 1940s and 50s had done it too. ※We only used to take one from each nest,§ a female friend told me, abashed. ※Everyone did it.§ It＊s simply an accident of history that people two decades older than me have nature knowledge I do not possess. So many of them, having spent their childhoods bird-nesting, still see a furze bush and think, linnet, and can＊t help but assess the ability of last year＊s laid hedge to hold a chaffinch＊s or robin＊s nest. They possess different wordless intuitions from me, ones relating to how one holds the landscape between head and eye and heart and hand. In my own history of the countryside, nests weren＊t things that were made to be found. They were carefully maintained blind spots, redacted lines in familiar texts. But even so, they had special salience when I was very young. For children, woods and fields and gardens are full of discrete, magical places: tunnels and dens and refuges in which you can hide and feel safe. I knew, when I was small, what nests were about. They were secrets. I followed the flights of blackbirds and tits and thrushes and nuthatches through my garden. And every spring their nests changed how I felt about home. To have the presence of these birds shrunk down to that one point of attachment, the nest, made me anxious. It raised questions of vulnerability, made me worry about predatory crows and cats, made the garden a place of threat, not safety. Though I never searched for nests, I＊d find them, all the same. I＊d be sitting at the kitchen window eating a bowl of Weetabix and I＊d spot a dunnock flit into the forsythia, a mouse-sized bird, all streaks and spots and whispers. I knew I should look away, but I＊d hold my breath at my transgression and track the almost imperceptible movement of leaves as the disappeared bird hopped up and across through twigs to its nest. Then I＊d see the blur of wings as the bird slipped free of the hedge and was gone. And once I＊d determined where it was, and saw that the adults were gone, I needed to know. Most of the nests I found were higher than my head, so I＊d reach my hand up and curl my fingers so their tips touched what might be warm, glossy, smoothness. Or the unbearable fragility of small flesh. I knew I was an intruder. Nests were like bruises: things I couldn＊t help but touch, even though I didn＊t want them to be there. They challenged everything that birds meant for me. I loved them most because they seemed free. Sensing danger, sensing a trap, sensing any kind of imposition, they could fly away. Watching birds, I felt I could share in their freedom. But nests and eggs tied birds down. They made them vulnerable.The old books on birds that lined my childhood shelves described nests as ※bird homes§. This confused me. How could a nest be a home? Back then I thought of homes as fixed, eternal, dependable refuges. Nests were not like that: they were seasonal secrets to be used and abandoned. But then, birds challenged my understanding of the nature of home in so many ways. Some spent the year at sea, or entirely in the air, and felt earth or rock beneath their feet only to make nests and lay eggs that tied them to land. This was all a deeper mystery. It was a story about the way lives should go that was somehow like 每 but not anything like 每 the one I＊d been handed as a child. You grow up, you get married, you get a house, you have children. I didn＊t know where birds fitted into all this. I didn＊t know where I did. It was a narrative that even then gave me pause.I think differently of home, now. It＊s a place that you carry within you, not simply a fixed location. Perhaps birds taught me that, or took me some of the way there. For some birds＊ nests are homes because they seem indivisible from the birds that make them. Rooks are rookeries 每 birds of feathers and bone that are also massed assemblages of twigs in February trees. House martins peering from the entrances of their nests under summer gables are beings of wings and mouths and eyes but also all the architecture of gathered mud. And some birds＊ nests seem so far from nests at all that the word itself drifts and almost loses purchase. The form of one such nest is: chips of old rock and bones and hardened guano, where the overhang supplies shade. The form of another is: a raft of weeds that rises and falls with the ebb and flow of water. Another: a dark space under roof tiles where you can crawl on your mouse feet and your wings drag like feathered blades the colour of carbon steel. Peregrine. Grebe. Swift. These days I wonder about how nests seem to be one kind of entity when they contain eggs and a different kind of entity when they contain chicks. How nests and eggs are good things to think about when considering matters of individuality, and the concepts of same, and different, and series. How the form of a nest is part of the phenotype of a particular bird species, but how local conditions foster beautiful idiosyncracies. How we humans are intrigued when birds make nests out of things that belong to us: house finches lining their nests with cigarette butts, nests of bullock＊s orioles fashioned from twine, kites decorating their tree platforms with underwear stolen from washing lines. A friend of mine found a ferruginous hawk＊s nest wrought almost entirely from lengths of wire. It＊s satisfying to consider the incorporation of human detritus into the creations of birds, but it is troubling, too. What have they made out of what we have made of this world? Our world intersects with theirs and our habitations are strangely shared. We have long rejoiced at birds building nests in unusual places. We love the robin rearing chicks in an old teapot, a hen blackbird sitting tightly on a nest tucked above the stop bulb on a traffic light: these are nests that gesture towards hope, as birds use our things for their own ends, making our technologies redundant, slowed down, static, full of meaning that is no longer entirely our own. But that is what nests are. Their meaning is always woven from things that are partly bird and partly human, and as the cup or wall of a nest is raised, it raises, too, questions about our own lives. Do birds plan like us, or think like us, or really know how to make knots, or slap beaks full of mud in series, or is this merely instinct? Does the structure they＊re making begin with some abstract form, a mental image, to which the bird plans, rather than thinking, step by step, there. That is where that goes? These are questions that pull on us. We make things according to plans, but all of us also have that sense of where things should go. We feel it when we arrange objects on mantelpieces, or furniture in rooms. Artists feel it when they construct collages, when they sculpt, when they bring pigment to bear on a surface, knowing that the dark smear of paint just here provides or provokes a sense of balance or conflict when viewed in relation to the other marks upon the scene. What is it in us? We are fascinated by the difference between skill and instinct, just as we police the differences between art and craft. If pigment is smeared on to a guillemot＊s eggshell as it rotates before being laid in drip-splashes that resemble in their exuberance and finesse the paintings of abstract expressionists, what is our delight in those patterns saying about us? I think of that need to collect that sometimes is billionaires hoarding de Koonings and Pollocks and sometimes welders hiding plastic margarine tubs full of exquisitely marked red-backed shrike eggs beneath beds and floorboards.We see our own notions of home and family in the creatures around us; we process and consider and judge, and prove the truth of our own assumptions from a hall of twigs and mud and shells and feathered mirrors. In science, too, the questions we ask are commonly woven this way. I think of ＊s eminence in the field of ethology 每 and remember, too, his patient attention to the way ritualised gestures appeased aggression in colonies of nesting gulls, and how they related to his anxieties about the relationship between overcrowded cities and human violence. I think of the young , full of all the sexual confusion of youth, spending one spring watching the courtship of great crested grebes, speculating on mutual sexual selection and ritualised behaviour. And I see interwar anxieties about marriage everywhere in Eliot Howard＊s work on bird behaviour; he puzzles over the concept of territory, of nest building, of extra-pair copulations, and is desperately keen to understand the reasons behind the sexual attractiveness of particular females who lure males from their established mates. And in literature, too, everywhere. Nesting birds naturalising the English class system in , where seabird nesting cliffs of auks and kittiwakes make ※an innumerable crowd of fish-wives on the largest grandstand in the world§, exclaiming phrases like ※Is me hat on straight§ and ※Crikey, this isn＊t ＆arf a do!§, while White＊s skeins of aristocratic pink-footed geese pass high over the slum, singing Scandinavian goose-themed sagas as they fly north. Friends of mine who grew up in marginal rural communities mostly have little truck with the mainstream rules of nature appreciation and the laws that enforce them. Most of them hunt with longdogs. Some of them poach game, or trap cock goldfinches to pair with hen canaries, before rearing their young as singing finches called mules. Some of them have collected eggs. Some of them probably still do, though I don＊t get to hear about that. Most have limited financial or social capital, and their claim on the landscape around them is through local field knowledge, rather than literal possession. Egg collecting in this tradition makes me wonder about the terms of ownership, investment and access to pleasure that economically deprived communities are allowed to have in the natural world. I think of Billy, the boy in ＊  who refuses to play football, refuses to work down the mine, rejects all the models of masculinity he＊s given. What opportunities for tenderness does he have? He strokes the backs of baby thrushes in their nest. He keeps a kestrel that he loves. What kinds of beauties can be possessed? If you are a landowner, you get the whole compass of the watered-silk sky and the hedges and the livestock and everything in it. But you＊re a factory worker? There＊s the rub. Egg collecting requires skill, bravery in the field, hard-won knowledge of the natural world. It can become an obsession for minds gripped with stilled beauty. It is a practice that stills time. The collectors grant themselves the power to withhold new lives and new generations. And egg collecting is also, at the same time, a one in the eye for the elite and all their rules about what is and what is not an acceptable way to relate to nature. Egg collecting was especially derided in the cultures of natural history operating during and after the second world war. At that time, British birds were laden with new significance. They were what the nation was made of, what we were fighting for. They became symbolically nationalised; to truly know your birds was to truly know your country, and to be a birdwatcher was a gloriously eccentric, British activity. In this milieu, species with a perilous foothold on British soil, such as avocets, little ringed plovers and ospreys, had their rarity bound up with imperilled nationhood. Thus, the theft of their eggs was now to be seen as an act akin to treason. And protecting the birds from the depredations of collectors was analogous to military service. Again and again, in books and films of this period, injured servicemen who have proved their bravery on the field of battle now show their love for their country by protecting rare birds trying to raise families. JK Stanford＊s , for example, where the threatened nest belongs to avocets, appeared in 1949, four years after the end of the war, and Kenneth Allsop＊s , published the same year, where it belongs to little ringed plovers. The historian of science Sophia Davis has written on how the villains of these books are egg collectors, routinely described as ※vermin§ and ※a menace to England§ and how the nests in their pages are guarded by heroes with the fate of the nation close to their heart. And indeed, gangs of egg protectors guarding the nests of rare birds were a true-life legacy of the war. After years in a German PoW camp, the ornithologist George Waterston sat with his colleagues by the first Scottish osprey nest for 50 years and kept it under observation through the telescopic sights of rifles. And in the 1950s, Stanford wrote of his own experiences guarding avocets. ※Keyed up by the general air of secrecy,§ he wrote, ※we sat till long after dusk, prepared for anything, even an amphibious raid by armed oologists.§ Egg collectors today tend to be characterised as beings in the grip of hopeless addiction, simultaneously suffering from great moral failings. These characterisations were codified in the cultures of postwar ornithology as threats to the body politic. Eggs and war; possession and hope and home. In the 1990s, years after my natural historical collection was disassembled and my childhood home was gone, I worked at a falcon-breeding centre in Wales. In one room were banks of expensive incubators containing eggs. Through the glass, their shells were the mottled browns of walnut, of tea stains, of onion skins. This was before the advent of newer incubators that mimic the press of a brood patch through hot air-filled plastic pouches. These were forced-air incubators with eggs on wire racks. We weighed them each day, and as the embryo moved toward hatching, we＊d candle them: place them on a light and scribe the outline of the shadow against the bright air cell with a soft graphite pencil, so that as the days went past the eggshell was ringed with repeated lines that resembled tides or wide-grained wood. But I always left the incubation room feeling unaccountably upset, with a vague, disquieting sense of vertigo. It was a familiar emotion I couldn＊t quite name. I finally worked out what it was one rainy Sunday afternoon. Leafing through my parents＊ albums I found a photograph of me a few days after my birth, a frail and skinny thing, one arm ringed with a medical bracelet and bathed in stark electric light. I was in an incubator, for I was exceedingly premature. My twin brother did not survive birth. And that early loss, followed by weeks of white light lying alone on a blanket in a Perspex box had done something wrong to me that echoed with a room full of eggs in forced-air boxes, held in moist air and moved by wire. Now I could put a name to the upset I felt. It was loneliness. That was when I recognised the particular power of eggs to raise questions of human hurt and harm. That was why, I realised, the nests in my childhood collection made me uncomfortable; they reached back to a time in my life when the world was nothing but surviving isolation. And then. And then there was a day. One day when, quite by surprise, I discovered that if I held a falcon egg close to my mouth and made soft clucking noises, a chick that was ready to hatch would call back. And there I stood, in the temperature-controlled room. I spoke through the shell to something that had not yet known light or air, but would soon take in the revealed coil and furl of a west-coast breeze and cloud of a hillside in one easy glide at 60 miles an hour, and spire up on sharp wings to soar to see the distant, glittering Atlantic. I spoke through an egg and wept. , an exhibition of films, archive material and found nests, by Andy Holden and Peter Holden, is at the Former Newington Library, London SE17. ."
"A row of terraced houses in the south  valleys could be demolished after the stretch of road outside their front doors was identified as having the worst air pollution in the UK outside London.Some residents of Woodside Terrace in Crumlin who believe their health is suffering, or despair at the constant roar of traffic, have welcomed the idea of the houses being razed. Others who have invested money, time and love into their homes hope alternatives such as a bypass or restrictions on lorries might be introduced instead. The Guardian  that government data showed the levels of nitrogen dioxide on this stretch of the A472 were exceeded only by part of Marylebone Road in central London. Though the spot in Crumlin is surrounded by fields and hills, the road is a main cross-route between two valleys, carrying more than 21,000 vehicles a day. ※I＊ve had enough,§ said Gloria Matthews, a 60-year-old carer who has lived on Woodside Terrace for 17 years. ※From 6am to 7pm the cars and lorries and vans rumble by. You can feel the vibrations, you can smell the fumes and you can never open your windows. ※It＊s got much worse over the years. Some people live in their cellars now to try to get away from the traffic.§The route is busy with local traffic, commuters travelling to Newport and Cardiff and is a shortcut for lorry drivers keen to avoid the M4, which is often congested, and the Severn Bridge tolls of ?20 for HGVs. Though HGVs and vans represent only 4% of traffic on the road, they account for more than a third of emissions. The geography of this spot in Caerphilly county exacerbates the problem. Even if the road happens to be clear, the steep hill slows the trucks down to a crawl. And the area is hemmed in by the terrace on one side and a hill on the other so that, especially on a still day, the fumes linger.Barbara Smith moved to the road four months ago but has already put her home back on the market (for offers in the region of ?89,950). The estate agent＊s website blurb does not mention the road and the only images are of the interior and back garden.Smith said she had invested ?3,500 on secondary glazing to counter the effects of the road but it did not solve the problem. ※I can＊t sleep, I can＊t breathe. I want to leave.§ and . Options included in a draft action plan include:  Compulsory purchasing homes on Woodside Terrace and demolishing them. Building a bypass. Introducing management measures to help the traffic at least flow more freely. Working with businesses, schools and other bodies to try to encourage more use of public transport and to walk. Reducing the number of lorries on the road.Martin Brown has put up homemade signs asking drivers to slow down. He has lived on the road for almost 50 years but he is in favour of compulsory purchase. ※My suggestion is to knock them all down,§ he said.Deanna Harwick, a mother of two young children, said she could never open her windows, ※so at this time of year the house feels pretty airless§. She believes the value of her home has decreased by up to ?20,000 since she bought it 10 years ago. ※I＊m worried I＊d lose money if there was a compulsory purchase. I＊d favour a bypass,§ Harwick said. The Wales Green party said the health of residents was being sacrificed because lorries and cars had been prioritised over people. The party spokesperson for Gwent, Ian Chandler, said: ※There are no easy answers to this particular problem. Building a new bypass will move some of the pollution away from the most affected houses, but the initial reduced congestion risks encouraging more traffic to use that route and so the problem returns. ※Purchasing and demolishing the homes removes the residents from the problem, but does nothing to reduce overall pollution.§Caerphilly council said it would listen carefully to what residents said they wanted to happen next. Eluned Stenner, a councillor and cabinet member for the environment and public protection, said: ※We remain fully committed to doing all we can to help improve the air quality situation, and I＊d encourage our residents to contribute their views on the contents of this draft action plan by taking part in this consultation.§ Jayne Davies, who has lived on the terrace for 25 years, said she loved her house. ※We＊ve made a lot of improvements over the years. The road is noisy but it＊s lovely out the back, with woods and a stream. So it＊s not all bad. ※I hope they can find a way to improve the road. Demolition seems too drastic.§"
"A stretch of coastline which is one of the most important sites in the UK for seabirds such as Arctic terns and Atlantic puffins has been given greater protection. The newly-designated  marine special protected area (SPA) stretches 12 miles from the coast into the North Sea, covering an area larger than 120,000 football pitches, government conservation body Natural England said.The area supports 200,000 seabirds and is the most important site in the UK for Arctic, common and roseate terns, the second most important for sandwich terns and the third most important site for Atlantic puffins, Natural England said. Designation of the SPA under the European Union birds directive builds on existing special protected areas covering seabird breeding sites at Coquet Island, Farne Islands, Lindisfarne and the Northumbria Coast. It will help ensure disturbance to the birds＊ open water feeding areas is minimised and help protect the full range of habitats the seabirds rely on, the conservation agency said. Environment minister Therese Coffey said: ※We already have one of the strongest track records in the world when it comes to looking after our precious marine environment, and today＊s designations will strengthen our blue-belt of protected areas while helping seabirds across the country thrive.§ Andrew Sells, Natural England chairman, said the designation marked a ※momentous day§ for some of the UK＊s best-loved and most charismatic seabirds, many of which had suffered population declines in recent decades. ※These designations will protect vital feeding areas for seabirds along the English coast, creating safe havens to help the birds thrive for generations to come,§ he said. Chris Corrigan, director of RSPB England, said: ※It is fantastic to see these special places being recognised and given the protection they so need and we hope to see more designations in the very near future. ※As the UK moves closer to leaving the EU, we urge the government to continue to recognise the significance of protecting these sites, based on scientific evidence, and that they continue to protect and manage these sites to the same or even higher standards than those currently secured by European law for generations to come.§ Natural England has also announced extensions to Hamford Water SPA in Essex and Morecambe Bay and Duddon Estuary SPA in Cumbria, adding an area bigger than 150,000 football pitches to the existing marine protected area network.
