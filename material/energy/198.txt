The Greens want to regulate the electricity system to ensure a  fair price  is paid for solar-generated electricity and ensure a  legal right  to connect to the grid by forcing energy companies to prove they cannot connect a consumer.The Greens  clean energy policy would put $192m for solar into schools, establish a solar ombudsman who would enforce a  right to solar  for renters and force energy companies to write-down pole and wire assets. The Greens would also put $5m into an information campaign to promote the Clean  Finance Corporation s (CEFC) schemes to support households and businesses installing solar with no upfront costs.The policy, to be launched on Monday by the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, and MP Adam Bandt would force a  fair price  to be paid by energy companies. Solar homes and businesses would be protected from fees and charges  likely to be imposed by electricity networks clawing back their diminishing revenues as our electricity system decentralises and consumers become empowered , the policy says.In New South Wales, the generous five-year state government-subsidised scheme pays up to 60 cents per kilowatt   depending on the time of contract   until December. More than 146,000 NSW households which signed up to the scheme will revert to a market price of about 6 cents in January 2017.In Victoria, solar households and small-scale wind turbine generators are currently on a flat 5.2-cent-a-kilowatt-hour tariff for power sold to the grid.The Greens policy also calls for a national standard on connection to the electricity grid to  fast-track  renewable energy in Australia. The Greens want a fee structure and a timeframe for commercial and domestic connections, with guidelines for potential connections and a right to appeal decisions of network companies when applications for connections are refused.The Greens have already released a policy calling for 90% of energy generated from renewables by 2030. The party would also establish a new $500m government authority   RenewAustralia   to plan and drive the transition to a new clean energy system. It would also create a $250m Clean  Transition Fund to assist coal workers and communities with the transition.
