ven in the home entertainment market, African cinema still gets such short shrift from UK distributors that the announcement of an on-demand service from London s  initiative is genuine cause for celebration   even if their selection at the moment, available through the Nollywood-specific , is something of a lucky dip for the unacquainted. Dominated by Nigeria and Ghana, the menu mixes impassioned, socially conscious storytelling with clunkier stabs at genre, but it has a couple of winningly accessible entry points.Glowingly shot but uncushioned by sentimentality, Ghanaian director Priscilla Anany s  stirringly tells of a young rural mother s social ostracism after she gives birth to a deformed child. In a more western vein, Frenchman Simon Rouby s gorgeous animation  is an engrossing first world war survival story. Detailing a young West African boy s search for his brother across ravaged Europe in earthy, tactile tones, its rich imagery appears blotted on to canvas.Coincidentally enough, Mubi.com is also doing its bit for African representation this week. Recent additions to their streaming lineup include , South African director Pia Marais s subtly nervy moral thriller, never released in the UK, about a female polygraphist tangled in hit-and-run guilt, and Chadian auteur Mahamet-Saleh Haroun s 2002 , a wry, gently mournful study of paternal abandonment.The week s new DVD releases are, put politely, a rum old bunch   and in the case of  (Entertainment One, PG), the rum in question has turned all the way back to molasses. Deprived dog-lovers will get fleeting, heart-fluttering pleasure from this canine-reincarnation saga   wherein one stout-hearted mutt travels through multiple adorable dogs  bodies over several decades, for maximum  awwww  value   but it s less a movie than an unprecedentedly glossy  dogs do the darndest things  YouTube video.That said, a few more cute-critter montages would liven up  (Universal, 12), a pallidly earnest, clean-scrubbed Holocaust drama in which Jessica Chastain s saintly Polish animal lover opens her husband s zoo to Jews seeking sanctuary of another sort. Chastain smiles bravely through the dewy lighting, but deserves better.So does Noomi Rapace, the original girl with the increasingly faded dragon tattoo, stoically kicking arse through a standard triple-crossed CIA obstacle course in cheerfully anonymous spy thriller  (Lionsgate, 15). Bonus points for Toni Collette in an Annie Lennox crop brandishing a machine gun; points immediately rescinded for a faux-Cockney Orlando Bloom. Meanwhile, the week s least competent film is handily its most rompingly enjoyable.  (Warner, 15), a riotously overbaked and underreasoned ex-versus-new-wife thriller, finds an unflattering but unexpectedly fabulous niche for Katherine Heigl s pristine, pricklish screen personaclod High-Maintenance Psycho Barbie, spilling passive-aggressive mothering tips before going full bunny-boiler in an ice-white designer kaftan. A star is reborn.This week s worthiest rereleases include smart new transfers of Sidney Lumet s (Powerhouse, 12), a stern, smoke-singed John Le Carr  adaptation; Ermanno Olmi s lovely, somewhat sidelined 1978 Palme d Or winner (Arrow, 12), a tough and tender, season-to-season evocation of Bergamo peasant living; and  (Powerhouse, 15), in which Alan Bates and Janet Suzman gutsily interpret Peter Nichols s oft-renewed play about two parents  perverse comic response to the plunging pain of their daughter s disability. Finally, a spiky, salty Joe Orton double bill from 1970, as both Silvio Narizzano s  (Studiocanal, 15) and Douglas Hickox s  (Studiocanal, 15) preserve the late playwright s razored language and slinky queer sexuality to still-seductive, still-disorienting effect.
