rom the faith-based studio that brought you    and launched a streaming service for Christians presumably reluctant to Netflix and chill   comes this preachily earnest drama adapted from a best-selling book by Lee Strobel (played by Mike Vogel). Set in 1980, Strobel is a card-carrying atheist working as an investigative reporter in Chicago when his wife finds God. Turning to the tools of his trade, Strobel sets out to prove that JC is up there with the tooth fairy   interviewing historians, archeologists and doctors. Instead, he s rattled by the experts and experiences a crisis of atheism (as portrayed here, he s no ). For a Christian film, this is decently acted, but with the sentimentality cranked up, it drags on for what feels like eternity.
