In the wake of Wednesday's shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Friday that politicians should take responsibility for their divisive rhetoric, but she emphasized that lawmakers strive for bipartisanship. In an interview on "CBS This Morning," the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if the dialogue in Washington should be toned down and whether heated rhetoric contributed to the shooting. "I think that we all have to take responsibility for what we say," she said. "But do understand there's a lot where we try to continue to work together. It doesn't catch the headlines in the same way." Warren, who's out with a new book called "This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America's Middle Class," said she introduced three bills this week. She said she unveiled one of them with Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, which aims to increase pay for enlisted military servicemembers, and another one was introduced with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, which aims to give domestic victims of terrorism access to military hospitals. The Democrat, who's been rumored to be a possible 2020 presidential contender, slammed the Senate Republican leadership for having 13 of her male Republican colleagues meeting behind closed doors, without Democrats, to craft their health care bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. "This is a bill that's going to touch every American family," Warren said. Senate Republicans have not yet released the text of their health care plan. Earlier this week, President Trump called the version passed by the House "mean" in a meeting with GOP senators, even though he held a celebratory event in the White House Rose Garden after it passed.
