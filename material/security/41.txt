BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's cyber security is blighted by information leakage, according to a report released Thursday by a national computer monitoring center. Cyber attacks and security system breaches faced by telecommunication companies are becoming increasingly serious due to technological advances, the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team Coordination Center (CNCERT) said in the report, drawing particular attention to cloud computing and big data analysis. Almost 1,600 telecommunication breaches were dealt with in 2014 by CNCERT, three times more than in the previous year. A total of 9,068 cases were detected and reported, again, three times more than in 2013. China's e-commerce enterprises, express delivery services, recruitment websites and test-registration websites are the most vulnerable, and many reported information leakages in 2014, said Yan Hanbing, a senior CNCERT official. At the end of 2014, China's Internet penetration rate was 47.9 percent, with 3.65 million websites and 649 million people online, 557 million of them via mobile phones. Although a victim of cyber crimes itself, China has often faced criticism from other countries, especially the United States. A Pentagon cyber-security strategy recently claimed concern about cyber-espionage by China against U.S. companies and agencies. China has been the victim of cyber attacks and steadfastly opposed hacking in any form, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng said at a monthly press briefing on Thursday. The United States should give up double standards and stop bringing shame on other countries, Geng urged.
