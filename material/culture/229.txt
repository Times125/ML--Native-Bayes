While his changes of tempo can be sudden they never seem dangerous, and for all its urgency the concerto s passion seems constrained   although the second movement is strikingly unhackneyed, played like a lullaby in which the melody is suspended above flowing notes that roll on and on. The episodic Variations suit the cool, controlled approach better, and it s here that both Vinnitskaya and the orchestra shine.
