Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday responded to President Trump's suggestion a day earlier that there were "very fine people, on both sides" in Charlottesville last weekend. "There are no good neo-Nazis, and those who espouse their views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms. We all have a responsibility to stand against hate and violence, wherever it raises its evil head," the Kentucky Republican said in a statement. McConnell didn't explicitly call out the president in his statement, which also said that white supremacist, neo-Nazi and KKK groups are planning a rally in Lexington, Kentucky. "Their messages of hate and bigotry are not welcome in Kentucky and should not be welcome anywhere in America," he said.

You had people in that group — excuse me, excuse me — I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name," Mr. Trump said.?
