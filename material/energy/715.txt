Friday was Britain s first ever working day without coal power since the Industrial Revolution, according to the .The control room tweeted the milestone on Friday. It is the first continuous 24-hour coal-free period for Britain since use of the fossil fuel began. West Burton 1 power station, the only coal-fired plant that had been up and running, went offline on Thursday.The UK has had , as gas and renewables such as wind and solar play an increasing role in the power mix. The longest continuous period until now had been 19 hours   first achieved on a weekend last May, and matched on Thursday.A National Grid spokesman said the record low was a sign of things to come, with coal-free days becoming increasingly common as the polluting fuel is phased out.  has seen significant declines in recent years, accounting for just 9% of electricity generation in 2016, down from around 23% the year before, as coal plants closed or switched to burning biomass such as wood pellets.Britain s last , as part of a government plan to phase out the fossil fuel to meet its climate change commitments. Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace UK, said:  The first day without coal in Britain since the Industrial Revolution marks a watershed in the energy transition. A decade ago, a day without coal would have been unimaginable, and in 10 years  time our energy system will have radically transformed again. The direction of travel is that both in the UK and globally we are already moving towards a low carbon economy. It is a clear message to any new government that they should prioritise making the UK a world leader in clean, green, technology. Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate and energy at WWF, called the first coal-free working day  a significant milestone in our march towards the green economic revolution . Getting rid of coal from our energy mix is exciting and hugely important. But it s not enough to achieve our international commitments to tackle climate change   we haven t made anything like the same progress on decarbonising buildings and transport. Whoever forms the next government after the general election, they must prioritise a plan for reducing emissions from all sectors.  Redmond-King said.Britain became the first country to use coal for electricity when Thomas Edison opened the Holborn Viaduct power station in London in 1882. It was reported in the Observer at the time that  a hundred weight of coal properly used will yield 50 horse power for an hour.  And that each horse power  will supply at least a light equivalent to 150 candles .
