Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said on the Senate floor that he had been informed that the Alexandria shooter who had targeted his GOP colleagues Wednesday morning volunteered on his 2016 presidential campaign. Sanders was quick to condemn the shooting. "Let me be as clear as I can be," Sanders said on the Senate floor. "Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms. Real change can only come about through non violent action and anything else runs counter to our most deeply held American values." Sanders also said that he was "sickened by this despicable act," the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, staffers and Capitol Police during a Republican congressional baseball game practice. The Vermont senator also issued a statement on Twitter following the shooting expressing his concern for Scalise, who was shot in the hip during the incident. "We've got to stop the violence," Sanders tweeted. The gunman, James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, died of his injuries after he was shot by Capitol Police, President Trump announced late Wednesday morning. Hodgkinson used an M-4 assault rifle to carry out the attack.  Top House Republican and at least four other people were shot by rifle-wielding gunman at congressional baseball practice Hodgkinson's personal Facebook page reveals several posts supporting Sanders, as well as frequent posts critical of the Republican party and Mr. Trump.
