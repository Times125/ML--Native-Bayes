A cross party group of MPs is calling on  to adopt a clean air bill in his new strategy to tackle the crisis of air pollution in the UK.Sixty five MPs have written to the environment secretary as he prepares to address the most pressing issue in his intray šC a demand by judges for a new air quality strategy by 31 July to cut illegal levels of pollution from diesel vehicles.Labour MP Geraint Davies, who introduced a clean air bill into the last parliament, said there was cross party support for the measures. These include:Levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), emitted mostly by diesel vehicles, have been above legal limits in almost 90% of urban areas in the UK since 2010. The toxic fumes are estimated to cause 23,500 early deaths a year and the problem was declared a  by a cross-party committee of MPs in April 2016.The government¡¯s plans to tackle air pollution have been found by judges to be so poor that they are unlawful. Gove has until the end of July to come up with a new air quality strategy which will cut emissions in the shortest possible time.The government also faces stiff fines from the European commission, which has sent Britain a final warning to comply with EU air pollution limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or face a case at the European court of justice.A draft of the government¡¯s plan was published in May before Gove took over as environment secretary. But it was widely condemned, Evidence published as part of the draft plan suggested that a network of clean air zones which stop the dirtiest diesel vehicles entering the most polluted areas of UK towns and cities would be the most effective solution. But the plan did not mandate local authorities to create such zones.The MPs, who include Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP and Green members of parliament, called in their letter for Gove to implement the measures in the clean air bill in the new air quality strategy.Davies said: ¡°Thanks to the cross party support for the [clean air] bill, I have been able to unite growing pressure on the new Defra secretary Michael Gove to take bold action to give the UK leadership in combatting air pollution, which is now a public health disaster.¡±The government has repeatedly lost in the courts over its failure to tackle dirty air. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth won a case against the government in the supreme court in April 2015, when judges ordered ministers to come up with a plan to reduce air pollution to within legal limits as soon as possible.When the plan was released ClientEarth took the government back to court and it was found to be so poor it was illegal. The courts ordered the government to revise its plans. If the UK does not satisfy the European commission that it is acting to reduce its emissions, it could face a lump sum fine, a penalty payment, daily five-figure fines, or a combination of these.Officials  by the judgements of the European court in Luxembourg for as long as it remains a member of the EU.
