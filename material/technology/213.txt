The company has rolled out its Black Friday deals store, with bargains offered through the day after Thanksgiving. For the first time, augmented reality is an option. Amazon says iPhone customers can shop for home office products, decor and electronics -- and get a look at how those products would look in their own homes.

The app also allows products to rotate a full 360 degrees. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) already has a slew of other ways to shop, including its traditional website and app. Customers can shop by voice using an Alexa-enabled device. And the company is touting its physical bookstores, as well as a new service called Treasure Truck. Customers can sign up for notifications about special offers that they can pick up from trucks that will roll through 25 cities.
