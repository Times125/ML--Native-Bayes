The  has called on political parties to spell out plans to spread prosperity to all Britain s regions after warning that economic activity is becoming ever more concentrated in London and the south-east.On current trends, the  said, the two most prosperous regions would account for 40% of national output by the end of the next parliament in 2022.Highlighting the big geographical shifts in the UK, the TUC said that in 1997  and the south-east accounted for a third of national output. That had risen to 37.7% by 2015   the last year for which data is available   and would continue rising to 40.1% by 2022.London, in particular, has expanded rapidly over the last two decades, from 18.7% to 22.7% of GDP between 1997 and 2015 and with a further increase to 24.8% of GDP by 2022.Other regions are expected to show relative decline. Yorkshire and Humberside is projected to see its share of GDP fall by 0.5 points to 6.1%, with the north-west and Scotland experiencing falls of 0.4 point falls. The West and east Midlands and the east of England will see small rises in their GDP share, the TUC said.The Brexit vote last year highlighted the  Theresa May has said the government s planned industrial strategy will help the  left behind  parts of the country, while Labour has also called for action to regenerate the regions.The TUC general secretary, Frances O Grady, said:  This analysis shows that, with London and the south-east dominating economic growth, too many people are missing out on the chance of a decent job just because of where they live. That s not sustainable, and it s why more than ever we need an industrial strategy that delivers good jobs where they re needed most. Britain needs great jobs   and all the political parties must explain in their manifestos how they will deliver growth in every corner of the country, not just the capital. The TUC said a comprehensive industrial strategy was essential for rebalancing the economy and for bringing strong growth and decent jobs to all parts of the UK. It called on the parties to make manifesto commitments to:The Industrial Communities Alliance   an all-party body representing local authorities in the traditional industrial areas of England, Scotland and Wales   said it was vital to create a UK regional development fund worth at least ?1.5bn a year to compensate for the loss of EU funds after Brexit.Terry O Neill, the alliance s chairman, said:  The ways we go about regenerating our areas, and the sources of funding we draw on, all need rethinking. The government knows this, and it is one of the challenges they have to address over the next couple of years.
