I watched the  spam sketch when it first went out   that now seems a little bit like being someone who remembers hearing the announcement of the second world war when it started, it s part of history. My mum and dad hated Monty Python because it broke the rules and they didn t often let me watch it. This one night I was allowed to, and I just cried and cried. What made it funnier was my mum and dad just looking at me like,  What s the matter with him, this isn t funny. Fifty-nine, because it s a lot of most things, but also ridiculously specific. How many people have we got coming round for Christmas dinner? Fifty-nine!In , Bart is asked:  If you could be an animal what would you be? . And he says,  I d be a butterfly, because nobody ever suspects the butterfly.  And then you see in his mind, the school is burnt to the ground and there s a butterfly with a Bart head and he s got a can of petrol. That s probably the best and most subversive joke I ve ever seen in mainstream television.The first  standup I saw, at an all-night film session at the Ritzy cinema in Brixton in about 1981. I d never heard of him and it just came on at three in the morning. That s the most I ve ever laughed at a film. That probably changed everything for me.I remember one night when I did the clubs, I think I was at Up the Creek, and someone shouted  Show us your fridge . The whole of the rest of the gig just became about this man.Leopard. Because it s really not appropriate most of the time.Everything that shouldn t be funny is funny to a comic. We re evil.
