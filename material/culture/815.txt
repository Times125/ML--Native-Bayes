The Moorish Screen inevitably calls to mind that famed  quote about art being like a good armchair where  the businessman as well as the man of letters  can relax.It is one of his rare depictions of women in the fashions of the day: his daughter and a favourite model, Henriette Darricarr re. They make a genteel pair, surrounded by the gorgeously patterned decor of a well-travelled, bourgeois, bohemian family.But if Matisse  to the violence and politics of his rival Picasso, that doesn t mean he wasn t interested in revolution. It s just that his upheaval was all about what you did with paint.This is an early work from his prolific Nice period, when he left a starker, more abstract style for one where the eroticism erupts in pattern as much as in flesh. It s typified by images of women, in harem pants or falling out of flimsy wraps. Yet they re also sites of experimentation, and an exercise in joy after the horrors of war.
