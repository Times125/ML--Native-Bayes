We re also taking action right now, to ensure electricity prices are lower right now for Australian families,  he said.Turnbull confirmed the government would hold a further meeting with power companies this week after  to give customers on expired discount deals information on more favourable plans.Earlier on Fox FM Radio, Turnbull suggested the meeting would reinforce those commitments and said that at least 1 million Australians were paying too much for their electricity .Guardian Australia understands Turnbull will also push for further measures including companies reducing hurdles to changing electricity plans, such as red tape and fees.Turnbull suggested that government pressure had already resulted in  people being offered 25-27% discounts  worth more than $2,000 a year to the average household.At a press conference in Melbourne, Shorten said the Snowy Hydro 2.0 scheme was  a good idea in the future but that s going to take years to come online   we have a gas crisis right now .He called on the Turnbull government to  pull the trigger on [gas] export controls , warning of potential job losses due to gas prices.In April  if there was a shortage of gas in the domestic market. Shorten said this was  the right law  but gas prices had increased because the threat had not been activated.Shorten said there was an  added complication  because of questions over the eligibility to sit in parliament of the former resources minister Matt Canavan and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, whose . With a cloud over [Joyce s] eligibility to hold office, what the government s done is given the big gas companies a beautiful volley back if the government tries to stand up for Australian jobs in Australian industry. Asked about Shorten s claim, Turnbull said:  No, don t you worry about that   be absolutely assured that the domestic gas mechanism is all in hand. We will ensure there are adequate supplies of gas for the domestic market. Turnbull said the government was still working through . He said the government was first waiting for a report from the Australian Energy Market Operator about the amount of dispatchable, baseload power needed in the system.
