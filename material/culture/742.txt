t has been  operas, two of them so far   including the widely admired Breaking the Waves, based upon    that have established her reputation in the US. The New York-based Mazzoli is still largely an unknown quantity in the UK, but  concert with the BBC Symphony Orchestra opened with the first European performance of the orchestral version of Sinfonia (for Orbiting Spheres), which Mazzoli composed four years ago, and turned into a work for full orchestra last year.The title and subtitle hark back both to the baroque sinfonia, and to the idea of using the model of the solar system, with its different orbits and periodicities, as a starting point for the music. The shifting layers of Mazzoli s Sinfonia are assembled from short loops of material that coalesce into longer ones and rotate at different speeds, though the overall effect is more about texture than rhythm or pulse.In the hall at least, the melodica and the multiple harmonicas that Mazzoli smuggles into her orchestra did not blur the harmonies and simulate the wheezing sound of a medieval hurdy gurdy (once called a  sinfonia ) as she intended. Listening later to the BBC broadcast gave a better sense of what the effect should have been, though perhaps something was lost when the piece was scaled up to orchestral proportions. The result still seemed strangely inconsequential, as if this 12-minute movement is merely a beginning, the mysterious prelude to something weightier to come.There were balance problems too in Bart k s Second Piano Concerto, where  dazzling virtuosity often seemed to be obscured by even the most modest orchestral writing   more to do with the directions taken by the sound from a concert grand and the acoustic eccentricities of the Albert Hall than the performances from the pianist or the BBCSO, I m sure. Once again, there were no such difficulties in the broadcast, when the wit and delicacy of Denk s playing, both in the concerto and in the movement of a Mozart piano sonata (K545) he added as an encore, could be fully appreciated.Canellakis and the orchestra provided a crisp, efficent accompaniment to the concerto, and their performance of Dvo? k s Eighth Symphony was equally efficient, if not especially characterful: there s more to this symphony than guileless melodic invention, but none of those darker, angrier undercurrents were touched upon here.
