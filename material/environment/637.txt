Donald Trump s decision to pull out of the Paris agreement on climate change means the US joins only two other countries not signed up to the historic accord.The only other UN members not signed up are  and Syria, which both chose not to enter into the climate accord in the first place.Their reasons for doing so were very different from those that seem to be influencing Donald Trump, who has previously described climate change as a hoax.Nicaragua declined to sign up because it thought the accord did not go far enough. In November 2015, Paul Oquist, Nicaragua s lead envoy to the Paris negotiations, :  We re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure.

Nevertheless, other countries in the midst of conflict have signed up, including , as well other countries isolated by the international community, such as . Syria s share of global emissions is also low compared with the US, at 0.14%.
