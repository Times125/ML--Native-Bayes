e had  in South Australia last week   and, ever since, we ve had the unfulfilling storm of spin about what caused the lights to go off.The release on Wednesday of  into the sequence of events that caused the power outages has given us new and important, albeit incomplete, information about a serious episode in Australia s energy market.Predictably, it has also generated a new burst of florid interpretation, never mind the nuances.. See? Told you so! Wicked windfarms, always snickering away on exposed hillsides, plotting the downfall of civilisation.So   was it the wind?Well, in part, yes, it was, but if you were going to plot a graph of significant events in a deeply unfortunate cascading sequence it would look like this.So yes, if you were interested in highly selective storytelling, you could thunder  it was the windfarms what did it . Colonel Mustard, in the library, with the candlestick.But, if you are interested in understanding the complete picture, it s the one I ve just given you, subject to the caveat that the AEMO itself gives   that it s too early to  know  several things. We ll get another update from the regulator on 19 October, then the final detailed assessment in about six months  time.What the events in  should do is this: trigger a serious conversation about whether federal and state governments are working together collaboratively to ensure we are combining measures to ensure future energy security with the urgent imperative of lowering greenhouse gas emissions to meet our international obligations.Australia needs to do both these things.One way in which the various jurisdictions could demonstrate seriousness would be to consider whether the electricity sector could benefit from a form of carbon trading that would split the difference between the federal government s Direct Action scheme and Labor s election policy.Walking in that direction   apart from being a rational line of inquiry for its own sake   could also call truce on Australia s toxic cycle of climate politics that has dogged this debate for the best part of a decade.Trying to find a workable middle ground, and being guided by expert views, could end a deeply unfulfilling cycle where people feel free to select their own facts   a habit which generally produces suboptimal policy outcomes.If the federal government is concerned about states going off on frolics with overly ambitious renewable energy targets, it could do a couple of things that would engineer better outcomes   it could extend the life of the national renewable energy target beyond 2020 to provide more investment certainty and it could provide clear leadership about the importance of orderly transition to low emissions power sources, which has been the standout absent element in recent history. ministers meet in Canberra on Friday.The early signs have not been promising. But this is an opportunity that shouldn t be squandered.
