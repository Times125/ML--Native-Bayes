Industrial output shrank more than expected and the trade deficit widened in March in the latest signs that uncertainty surrounding  is beginning to weigh on the economy.Industrial output dropped by 0.5% in March, sharper than the 0.3% fall predicted by economists. It followed a 0.7% fall in February and brought the sector to a virtual standstill in the first quarter overall, with growth of just 0.1%, according to the  figures.Production was dragged lower as warmer-than-average temperatures led to a 4.2% fall in energy supply, and manufacturing also fell unexpectedly by 0.6% in March. Economists said the weak data made it unlikely that the ONS would revise up its first estimate of growth for the first quarter overall, .UK growth has been heavily dependent on consumer spending since the financial crisis, but economists believe households will begin to rein in spending in response to falling real pay, as inflation outpaces wage growth.The services sector, which includes hotels and restaurants, was the first major part of the economy to surpass pre-crisis levels of output. Construction followed, but industrial production and manufacturing have yet to fully recover, with output still below pre-crisis levels.Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said it was  a ropey set of March data for the UK economy that point to a poor end to a disappointing first quarter .The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) estimates that the pace of economic growth slowed to 0.2% in the three months ending in April, from 0.3% in the three months ending in March. Growth in the service sector has remained subdued, consistent with softer consumer spending growth. We expect the squeeze on household real incomes to continue as inflation accelerates throughout the year, reaching almost 3.5% by year end,  said Rebecca Piggott, research fellow at NIESR.The thinktank expects annual growth to slow to 1.7% in 2017, from 1.8% in 2016, before picking up to 1.9% in 2018.The broad services and goods deficit jumped to ?4.9bn in March from ?2.6bn in February according to separate figures from the ONS. Meanwhile, the trade in goods deficit widened to ?13.4bn, more than the ?11.8bn economists had been expecting.The figures suggested the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the  vote did little to boost exports in March, despite making British goods cheaper abroad.Instead there was a surge in imports, up ?2.9bn over the month, with an increase in imports of goods from both EU and non-EU countries. The main drivers were greater volumes of imported machinery and transport equipment   mainly cars   as well as oils and chemicals. Exports increased by just ?600m.Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, called the March trade figures  simply dreadful .The British Chambers of Commerce said that while the weaker pound was helping to make UK exporters more price competitive, they were also being hit by the rising costs of raw materials. As the UK moves through the Brexit process and beyond, it is vital that more is done to provide greater practical assistance for exporters, including developing an expanded trade mission and fairs programme and funding front-line, face-to-face support for exporters to help get UK businesses trading with the world,  said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC.A 0.7% fall in construction output in March added to the raft of weaker-than-expected data and reinforced fears that the UK economy is facing a renewed slowdown, as uncertainty about Britain s future outside the UK takes hold.Michael Thirkettle, chief executive at construction and property consultancy McBains Cooper, said the ONS figures provided the latest evidence of a slowdown in the sector as concerns over Brexit hit the construction industry. Whoever wins [the general election] on 8 June, Brexit will occupy much of the government s focus over the next two years, and consequently there will be continuing caution from the private and corporate sectors in construction. Yet the industry needs the opposite   some bold moves and big investments   if it is to produce sustained growth any time soon.  He said that any party pledges to increase housebuilding and address Britain s housing crisis would be hollow unless they were backed by concerted action to address skills shortages and increase access to finance.
