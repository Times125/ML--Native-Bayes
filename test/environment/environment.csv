"As the US comes to terms with its second major weather disaster within a month, an important question is whether the devastation caused by hurricanes  and  will convince Donald Trump and his administration of the reality of climate change.The president＊s luxurious Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida may escape Irma＊s wrath, but with the deaths of so many Americans, and billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses, the costs of climate change denial are beginning to pile up at the door of the White House.Just days before Harvey formed in the Atlantic last month,  introduced by his predecessor Barack Obama, to help American communities and businesses become more resilient against the risks of flooding, which are rising because of climate change.But the merciless assault on the US mainland by Harvey and Irma should be forcing the president to recognise the consequences of his arrogance and complacency in dismissing the research and analysis carried out by scientists.The flooded streets of Houston and the wind-ravaged homes of south Florida bear the unmistakable fingerprint of extreme weather made worse by manmade greenhouse gas emissions.A hurricane is a huge, rotating cluster of thunderstorms that forms above a sea surface that has a temperature of at least 26.5C. It is like a giant engine, transferring heat from the sea surface up into the atmosphere and generating strong winds and heavy rain in the process.The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from 1 June until 30 November, and typically produces 12 tropical storms, of which six reach hurricane strength 每 with sustained wind speeds of more than 73mph. There have been 11 storms so far this year, including six hurricanes. In early August, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration raised its prediction for the season to ※above normal§, suggesting that the final tally could be up to 19 storms, with nine of them hurricanes.But this season has already been remarkable in one respect because two major hurricanes, with sustained winds of more than 110mph, have hit the US mainland, after a period of 12 years when none of the strongest storms made American landfall. has also set records for being the strongest hurricane to have occurred in the open Atlantic, and for having sustained wind speeds of at least 185mph over the longest period. cannot be blamed for the hurricane count in any single season, nor for the occurrence of any single storm, but there are three ways in which it is making the consequences worse.First, although the intensity of a hurricane depends on many factors, warmer seawater tends to promote stronger storms. Average sea surface temperatures have been rising, and some parts of the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are warmer than average at the moment, which is a key reason why both Harvey and Irma became so strong so quickly.Second, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour, which can result in heavier rainfall. That is true not only for hurricanes but also for weaker storms across the world. Even relatively mild tropical storms can cause great damage by dropping huge volumes of rain over one area.Third, apart from strong winds and heavy rainfall, hurricanes cause damage through storm surges as their winds push seawater ahead of them. Storm surges can inundate extensive low-lying coastal areas, sweeping away everything in their path. Sea levels have been gradually rising globally, making storm surges bigger and deadlier.Scientists are still not sure about the other ways in which climate change may be impacting hurricanes. The main reason Harvey created such extreme flooding around Houston was that it stalled over the city and dumped rain for several days without moving on. We do not know if climate change played a role in creating the atmospheric conditions that made that happen.Nor can we yet predict whether climate change will affect the number of hurricanes that occur every year. Some studies have suggested that while numbers will drop, strengths will increase.Also uncertain is how natural climate variability affects hurricanes. Numbers have increased markedly in the North Atlantic since the 1990s, but this seems to be due, at least partly, to large-scale changes in ocean circulation that occur over many years or decades.However, it is clear that the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans will be at risk if Trump and his administration continue to deny the existence of climate change and its impact on the threat posed by hurricanes."																																																			
"any of us share some dim apprehension that the world is flying out of control, that the centre cannot hold. Raging wildfires, once-in-1,000-years storms and lethal heatwaves have become fixtures of the evening news 每 and all this after the planet has warmed by less than 1C above preindustrial temperatures. But here＊s where it gets really scary.If humanity burns through all its fossil fuel reserves, there is the potential to warm the planet by as much as 18C and raise sea levels by hundreds of feet. This is a warming spike of an even greater magnitude than that so far measured for the end-Permian mass extinction. If the worst-case scenarios come to pass, today＊s modestly menacing ocean-climate system will seem quaint. Even warming to one-fourth of that amount would create a planet that would have nothing to do with the one on which humans evolved or on which civilisation has been built. The last time it was 4C warmer there was no ice at either pole and sea level was 80 metres higher than it is today.I met University of New Hampshire paleoclimatologist Matthew Huber at a diner near his campus in Durham, New Hampshire. Huber has spent a sizable portion of his research career studying the hothouse of the early mammals and he thinks that in the coming centuries we might be heading back to the Eocene climate of 50 million years ago, when there were Alaskan palm trees and alligators splashed in the Arctic Circle.※The modern world will be much more of a killing field,§ he said. ※Habitat fragmentation today will make it much more difficult to migrate. But if we limit it below 10C of warming, at least you don＊t have widespread heat death.§In 2010, Huber and his co-author, Steven Sherwood, published one of the most ominous science papers in recent memory, ※Lizards will be fine, birds will be fine,§ Huber said, noting that life has thrived in hotter climates than even the most catastrophic projections for anthropogenic global warming. This is one reason to suspect that the collapse of civilisation might come long before we reach a proper biological mass extinction. Life has endured conditions that would be unthinkable for a highly networked global society partitioned by political borders. Of course we＊re understandably concerned about the fate of civilisation and Huber says that, mass extinction or not, it＊s our tenuous reliance on an ageing and inadequate infrastructure, perhaps, most ominously, on power grids, coupled with the limits of human physiology that may well bring down our world.In 1977, when power went out for only one summer day in New York, swaths of the city devolved into something like Hobbes＊s man in a state of nature. Riots swept across the city, thousands of businesses were destroyed by looters and arsonists lit more than 1,000 fires.In 2012, when the monsoon failed in India (as it＊s expected to do in a warmer world), 670 million people 每 that is, 10% of the global population 每 lost access to power when the grid was crippled by unusually high demand from farmers struggling to irrigate their fields, while the high temperatures sent many Indians seeking kilowatt-chugging air-conditioning.※The problem is that humans can＊t even handle a hot week today without the power grid failing on a regular basis,§ he said, noting that the ageing patchwork power grid in the United States is built with components that are allowed to languish for more than a century before being replaced. ※What makes people think it＊s going to be any better when the average summer temperature will be what, today, is the hottest week of the year in a five-year period and the hottest temperatures will be in the range that no one has ever experienced before in the United States? That＊s 2050.§By 2050, according to a , there will also be five billion people living in water-stressed areas.※Thirty to 50 years from now, more or less, the water wars are going to start,§ Huber said.In their book , Penn State＊s Lee Kump and Michael Mann describe just one local example of how drought, sea level rise and overpopulation may combine to pop the rivets of civilisation:※Increasingly severe drought in West Africa will generate a mass migration from the highly populous interior of Nigeria to its coastal mega-city, Lagos. Already threatened by rising sea levels, Lagos will be unable to accommodate this massive influx of people. Squabbling over the dwindling oil reserves in the Niger river delta, combined with potential for state corruption, will add to the factors contributing to massive social unrest.§※Massive social unrest§ here being a rather bloodless phrase masking the utter chaos coming to a country already riven by corruption and religious violence.※It＊s sort of the nightmare scenario,§ said Huber. ※None of the economists is modelling what happens to a country＊s GDP if 10% of the population is refugees sitting in refugee camps. But look at the real world. What happens if one person who was doing labour in China has to move to Kazakhstan, where they aren＊t working? In an economic model, they＊d be immediately put to work. But in the real world, they＊d just sit there and get pissed. If people don＊t have economic hope and they＊re displaced, they tend to get mad and blow things up. It＊s the kind of world in which the major institutions, including nations as a whole, have their existence threatened by mass migration. That＊s where I see things heading by mid-century.§And it doesn＊t get any better after 2050. But forecasts about the disintegration of society are social and political speculations and have nothing to do with mass extinctions. Huber is more interested in the hard limits of biology. He wants to know when humans themselves will actually start to disintegrate. His 2010 paper on the subject was inspired by a chance meeting with a colleague.※I presented a paper at a conference about how hot tropical temperatures were in the geological past and [University of New South Wales climate scientist] Steve Sherwood was in the audience. He heard my talk and he started asking himself the very basic question: ＆How hot and humid can it get before things start dying?＊ It was literally just an order of magnitude kind of question. I guess he thought about it and realised that he didn＊t know the answer and wasn＊t sure anyone else did either＃ Our paper really wasn＊t motivated by the future climate per se, because when we started we didn＊t know if there was any kind of realistic future climate state that would fall within this habitability limit. When we started, it was just like, ＆We don＊t know. Maybe you have to go to, like, 50C global mean temperature.＊ Then we ran a whole set of model results and it was rather alarming to us.§Sherwood and Huber calculated their temperature thresholds using the so-called wet-bulb temperature, which basically measures how much you can cool off at a given temperature. If humidity is high, for instance, things like sweat and wind are less effective at cooling you down and the wet-bulb temperature accounts for this.※If you take a meteorology class, the wet-bulb temperature is calculated by basically taking a glass thermometer, putting it in a tight wet sock and swinging it around your head,§ he said. ※So when you assume that this temperature limit applies to a human, you＊re really kind of imagining a gale force wind, blowing on a naked human being, who＊s doused in water, and there＊s no sunlight, and they＊re immobile and actually not doing anything other than basal metabolism.§Today, the most common maximums for wet-bulb temperatures around the world are 26C to 27C. Wet-bulb temperatures of 35C or higher are lethal to humanity. Above this limit, it is impossible for humans to dissipate the heat they generate indefinitely and they die of overheating in a matter of hours, no matter how hard they try to cool off.※So we were trying to get across the point that physiology and adaptation and these other things will have nothing to do with this limit. It＊s the easy-bake oven limit,§ he said. ※You cook yourself, very slowly.§What that means is that this limit is likely far too generous for human survivability.※When you do real modelling, you hit a limit much sooner, because human beings aren＊t wet socks,§ he said. According to Huber and Sherwood＊s modelling, 7C of warming would begin to render large parts of the globe lethally hot to mammals. Continue warming past that and truly huge swaths of the planet currently inhabited by humans would exceed 35C wet-bulb temperatures and would have to be abandoned. Otherwise, the people who live there would be literally cooked to death.※People are always like, ＆Oh, well, can＊t we adapt?＊ and you can, up to a point,§ he said. ※It＊s just after that point that I＊m talking about.§Already in today＊s world, heated less than 1C above preindustrial times, heatwaves have assumed a new deadly demeanour. . It was called a once-in-500-year event. It happened again three years later (497 years ahead of schedule). In 2010, a heatwave killed 15,000 people in Russia. In  alone from a heatwave that struck Pakistan while many were fasting for Ramadan. But these tragic episodes are barely a shade of what＊s projected.※In the near term 每 2050 or 2070 每 the US Midwest is going to be one of the hardest hit,§ said Huber. ※There＊s a plume of warm, moist air that heads up through the central interior of the US during just the right season and, man, is it hot and sticky. You just add a couple of degrees and it gets really hot and sticky. These are thresholds, right? These aren＊t just like smooth functions. It gets above a certain number and you hurt yourself very badly.§China, Brazil, and Africa face similarly infernal forecasts, while the already sweltering Middle East has what Huber calls ※existential problems§. The first flickers of this slow-motion catastrophe might be familiar to Europeans struggling to accommodate the tens of thousands of refugees at their borders: the collapse and  came after a punishing four-year drought. Still others have noted that the Hajj, which brings two million religious pilgrims to Mecca each year, will be a physically impossible religious obligation to fulfil due to the limits of heat stress in the region in just a few decades.But for the very worst-case emissions scenarios, heatwaves would not merely be a public health crisis or a ※threat multiplier§, as the Pentagon calls global warming. Humanity would have to abandon most of the Earth it now inhabits. In their paper, Huber and Sherwood write: ※If warmings of 10C were really to occur in the next three centuries, the area of land likely rendered uninhabitable by heat stress would dwarf that affected by rising sea level.§Huber said: ※If you ask any schoolchild, ＆What were mammals doing in the age of the dinosaurs?＊ they＊d say they were living underground and coming out at night. Why? Well, heat stress is a very simple explanation. Interestingly, birds have a higher set-point temperature 每 ours is 37C, birds＊ is more like 41C. So I actually think that＊s a very deep evolutionary relic right there. Because that wet-bulb temperature was probably maxing out around 41C in the Cretaceous, not 37C.§Back at the diner in New Hampshire, Huber told me about his ※favourite story§: the US Army＊s real-life parable of the so-called Motivated Point Man. In 1996, a platoon of light infantry spent days in the Puerto Rican jungle acclimatising to stifling heat and humidity, cautiously monitoring their water intake before simulating a night-time raid. The platoon included ※some of the most fit and motivated soldiers in the battalion§. When the evening of the raid came, the platoon leader began leading his troops through the jungle, machete-ing a path through the brush. Before long, he was felled by fatigue and delegated his leadership to an underling. When the second private failed to advance the platoon quickly enough, the platoon leader demanded to lead again. But soon he found himself hyperthermic and unable to walk. His soldiers had to douse him in cold water and supply him with intravenous infusions. Eventually, four soldiers had to carry him. Before long, the extra demands vitiated the entire platoon, all of whom began to fall prey to heat stress. The exercise had to be called off before it became a massacre.※So I look at that as, if it＊s night-time and acclimatised, fit people can just disintegrate into a pool of useless people on stretchers. That＊s what I see happening to society, to cultures,§ Huber said. ※If you want to know how mass extinctions happen, that＊s how. So when people talk about the Pleistocene megafauna extinctions and Clovis people, sometimes they act like it＊s a mystery how these things happen. But it happens in exactly the same way. You have something tearing apart the strongest members, the weaker ones try to fill in the gaps, they＊re really not strong enough to take it and the whole thing collapses.※You want to know how societies collapse?§ Huber said. ※That＊s how.§ As temperatures increase beyond preindustrial levels, widespread extinction of amphibians begins.As warming causes ice sheets to melt, krill populations suffer, threatening the penguins＊ main food source.About half of wooded tundra is lost, putting pressure on its inhabitants such as moose, lynx and brown bears.At warming just over the +2C limit agreed in Paris 25% of large mammals in Africa are extinct.Major loss of tropical rainforests and the species that depend on them for habitat, including orangutans, sloths and jaguars.At these temperatures, up to 70% of species would be extinct, coral reefs would be dead and deserts would expand across the globe."																																																			
"ave you ever seen a headless toad? If the answer is no, now is a good time to go out looking for one. You see, it is almost exactly at this time of year that they are becoming headless thanks to the actions of tiny parasites that are emerging from out of their bodies. It is with these creatures that I would like to begin this piece about the worthiness or worthlessness of parasites.The toadfly  is a small, nondescript fly not unlike a bluebottle. In spring it anoints a chosen toad with some eggs, which it lays on the toad＊s nose. The maggots that come forth from these eggs climb into the toad＊s nostrils, where they begin to eat its nasal passages along with its eyes and brain before bursting forth from the toad＊s head, all at once, later in the year. The result is a headless toad torso. Look out for them.How do the maggots know when to emerge en masse from the toad＊s head? The answer is that, as the maggots grow, they become primed like a bomb. They become temperature-sensitive. They use the toad＊s cold-bloodedness against it, activating a mass migration from the toad＊s head when temperatures regularly drop below 14C ＃ or about now.At the exact moment you read this, thousands of toads are walking around in the countryside with a ticking time bomb in their head. Primed like this, each toad becomes the bomb-laden bus that must not drive slower than 50mph  每 except the passengers are the bad guys. And the passengers are obsessed with the weather. And there are thousands of buses.As weird as it sounds, I＊ve become a big fan of toadflies. The same goes for mites, protozoa, worms, fleas and ticks. Parasites are de rigueur for life on Earth. It was only a matter of time before a group of scientists would have the gall to call for their conservation. This happened on Wednesday, opening up an interesting area of ethical debate about whether such animals as worms and ticks are worth saving. used parasite specimens from the Smithsonian Institution＊s Museum of National History to map out the survival fortunes of 457 parasites from across the world. By applying a range of climate models to these species it was discovered that, as an average, we may lose 10% of our global parasite diversity by 2070. If you include host creatures, many of which are facing extinction, the number of threatened parasite species skyrockets to one in three. The hangers-on are only just hanging on, it seems, and so our parasite friends may come to need us more than ever, to ensure their survival.Can we learn to love them, I wonder, particularly when they so often appear to cause such pain and suffering to other creatures? Sure, we could do without the parasites that cause intense distress to humans and their livestock and pets, but what about the rest? Would this be a poorer world without the humble toadfly? Or the ? Or the flatworm larvae, which  so that they can be eaten by birds, the only host in which the adult flatworm can mate? Or the ? Would we even notice if creatures like these disappeared overnight?The answer, as scientists are increasingly coming to understand, is yes, very probably. In many habitats on Earth, parasitism probably exceeds predation (preying on other species) as a means of acquiring energy for new life. In estuarine habitats, for instance, the number of parasitic trematode worms is . They have become the biomass upon which other things feed. In a curious sort of way, these creatures are now the life-givers.There are other examples. On some oceanic islands, the lice and ticks and fleas that seabirds bring with them provide life-giving sustenance to scorpions, lizards and spiders, . In a series of tests involving experimental grass plots in the US, the bulk of the biomass feeding on the grass didn＊t come from the herbivores above ground, but rather from the parasitic fungus below.The more we study parasites, they more we understand their value to ecosystems. They are not passengers within buses, in other words, but buses within bigger buses. And so I am happy to welcome parasites to the conservation debate.Though we may feel uncomfortable with having to include them, in time I suspect we will come to realise that they have a part to play, one that has gone overlooked and unrecognised. With more research, perhaps we will come to see the best of ourselves in them. Energy harvesters. Ecological dynamos. Bringers of life. Or perhaps they have new things to teach us, like how better we might use the planet＊s resources without anyone ever really noticing we were there. The true parasite-way.

"One of the world＊s largest marine protection areas has been created off the coast of Easter Island.The 740,000 sq km marine park is roughly the size of the Chilean mainland and will protect at least 142 endemic marine species, including 27 threatened with extinction.An astonishing 77% of the Pacific Ocean＊s fish abundance occurs here and recent expeditions .Apex predators found in the conservation zone include scalloped hammerhead sharks, minke, humpback and blue whales, and four species of sea turtle.Matt Rand, the director of the Pew Bertarelli ocean legacy project, which campaigned for the park, said: ※This marine reserve will have a huge global significance for the conservation of oceans and of indigenous people＊s ways of life.※The Rapa Nui have long suffered from the loss of timber, declining ecosystems and declining populations. Now they are experiencing a resurgence based on ensuring the health of the oceans.§Plans for the marine park were , at which the former US president Barack Obama declared his ※special love for the ocean§ in a video message. The plans were confirmed in a speech by Chilean president Michelle Bachelet on Saturday.The marine park＊s creation was enabled by a 73% vote in favour of the conservation zone from Easter Island＊s 3,000 Rapa Nui population in a referendum on 3 September, after five years of consultations.Extractive industries and industrial fishing will be banned inside the reserve, but the Rapa Nui will be allowed to continue their traditional artisanal fishing on small boats, using hand lines with rocks for weights.Ludovic Burns Tuki, the director of the Mesa del mar coalition of more than 20 Rapa Nui groups, said: ※This is a historic moment 每 a great and beautiful moment for the Rapa Nui, for the world and for our oceans.※We think this process can be an example for the creation of other marine reserves that we need to protect our oceans 每 with a respect for the human dimension.§After the creation of a comparable marine protection area  last year, ＊ waters could soon create a protected area of more than 2m sq km. This would have a unifying potential for the Polynesian people, according to Burns Tuki.※The ocean is very important to us as a source of food, but the Polynesians were great navigators and the ocean also represents our mother,§ he said. ※It enables us to move with a double canoe between the different islands.

"As recovery begins on the islands of the Caribbean and Florida braces itself for an onslaught, Irma has stormed into the record books as the most powerful . But such weather systems are far from a rarity. Hurricanes are a type of storm known as a tropical cyclone, which build from warm, moist air over the oceans. Water evaporates, leaving behind a region of low pressure, which is then filled by surrounding air, explains Adrian Champion, an expert in climate systems from the University of Exeter. This causes more ※new§ warm air to rise into the cyclone, he explains. As this warm, moist air cools, it forms clouds, releasing energy back into the cyclone, helping it to develop. Such systems form in the tropics as the water is warmer than elsewhere, therefore more easily evaporated. The ※spin§ of the hurricane is down to the rotation of the Earth affecting the movement of the air: since Irma formed north of the equator, it spins anticlockwise.Many different factors can cause the system to build. ※What causes it to intensify [beyond a standard cyclone] is either that the ocean is unusually warm or there is further instability [such as strong winds] in the atmosphere,§ said Champion.Depending on where these systems strike, they are given different names. ※If they hit the Americas then they are called hurricanes, if they hit Asia they are called typhoons and if they hit Africa and Australia they are called cyclones,§ said Champion. But it is when these severe storms head towards land that interest generally gathers pace 每 a factor that has led to hurricanes and other tropical cyclones being given specific monikers to avoid confusion and help the public and the media to share information. The names themselves are allocated based on a system devised by the World Meteorological Organization 每 if a tropical cyclone is particularly deadly, as in the case of Hurricane Katrina, its handle will not be used again.The strength of a hurricane is marked by its category on what is known as the Saffir-Simpson scale, which reflects the wind speeds 每 and hence the level of damage expected once the cyclone strikes land. While category 1 hurricanes are serious, expected to damage rooftops and bring down trees with wind speeds between 74 and 95mph,  was initially at the top end of the scale, meeting criteria for a category 5 hurricane: winds of 157mph or more, catastrophic damage, power outages that could last for many weeks, and areas of land rendered uninhabitable for months. But drastic though Irma is, one thing is for sure: the storm will pass.※The big thing is [hurricanes] only have this energy supply when they are over the oceans,§ said Champion. ※When they hit landfall they weaken and die away.§"																																																			
"he road climbs and thins with each turn. Where it reaches a little fist of cottages it doesn＊t stop but instead, strangely, has its way blocked from waist height up by low branches. A dead road, leading to the old reservoir. I walk a footpath bordered by stone walls, then over a stile and here it is, a sweep of miniature country. A rumpled slope, trees fat with summer, a little pond catching the sky. August dew sits on everything, and early sun lights every drop to a shimmer. I see rabbits, molehills, every bush twitching with life.I live less than a mile from here and would come to this meadow more, but for one thing. The air is awash with it, a roar that wavers only slightly, and never below uncomfortable. It＊s rush hour now, so maybe this is as bad as it gets. But it never goes away.Wothorpe-on-the-Hill is next to the A1. You don＊t see it. But you hear it, constantly. A raised road, four lanes, trucks, cars: it＊s tragic. A plague on this little place, under siege by a maddening local noise. I walk by the wall, past ancient woodworm-pitted stumps, towards , built in 1615, abandoned in 1700 and now a turreted husk, like a fantasy folly, or Du Maurier＊s Manderley. It＊s an impassive witness to the change before it: how much quieter this scene must have been. In The Silence Afterwards the Norwegian poet Rolf Jacobsen wrote of That title might need inverting to The Silence Before to resonate here.Noise might, should, be the next big environmental thing: it＊s blamed for learning disorders, hypertension, insomnia, dementia. Tranquillity is shrinking. People are forgetting what silence feels like. Back in the meadow. I walk to the little pond: it sits under a circle of trees, within a sea of nettles. I notice the nettles are covered in little snails. Snails are deaf. But vibrations they can feel. A breeze passes, quivers the dew-hung trees, and the whole area awakens with a cool, organic crackle-static as the water falls onto the nettles. Just for a second, I hear just this."																																																			
"hen I was small, I decided I wanted to be a naturalist. And so I slowly amassed a nature collection, and arranged it across my bedroom sills and shelves as a visible display of all the small expertises I＊d gathered from the pages of books. There were galls, feathers, seeds, pine cones, loose single wings of small tortoiseshell or peacock butterflies picked from spiders＊ webs, the severed wings of dead birds, spread and pinned on to cardboard to dry, the skulls of small creatures, pellets 每 tawny owl, barn owl, kestrel 每 and old bird nests. One was a chaffinch nest I could balance in the palm of a hand, a thing of horsehair and moss, pale scabs of lichen and moulted pigeon feathers; another a song thrush nest woven of straw and soft twigs with a flaking inner cup moulded from clay. But those nests never felt as if they fitted with the rest of my beloved collection. It wasn＊t that they conjured the passing of time, of birds flown, of life in death. Those intuitions are something you learn to feel much later in life. It was partly because they made me feel an emotion I couldn＊t name, and mostly because I felt I shouldn＊t possess them at all. Nests were all about eggs, and eggs were something I knew I shouldn＊t ever collect. Even when I came across a white half-shell picked free of twigs by a pigeon and dropped on a lawn, a moral imperative stilled my hand. I could never bring myself to take it home.I was raised at a time when the set of acceptable amateur bird-appreciation activities had shrunk to watching, feeding and counting them. Naturalists of the 19th and early 20th centuries had routinely collected birds＊ eggs, and most children who grew up in semi-rural or rural surroundings in the 1940s and 50s had done it too. ※We only used to take one from each nest,§ a female friend told me, abashed. ※Everyone did it.§ It＊s simply an accident of history that people two decades older than me have nature knowledge I do not possess. So many of them, having spent their childhoods bird-nesting, still see a furze bush and think, linnet, and can＊t help but assess the ability of last year＊s laid hedge to hold a chaffinch＊s or robin＊s nest. They possess different wordless intuitions from me, ones relating to how one holds the landscape between head and eye and heart and hand. In my own history of the countryside, nests weren＊t things that were made to be found. They were carefully maintained blind spots, redacted lines in familiar texts. But even so, they had special salience when I was very young. For children, woods and fields and gardens are full of discrete, magical places: tunnels and dens and refuges in which you can hide and feel safe. I knew, when I was small, what nests were about. They were secrets. I followed the flights of blackbirds and tits and thrushes and nuthatches through my garden. And every spring their nests changed how I felt about home. To have the presence of these birds shrunk down to that one point of attachment, the nest, made me anxious. It raised questions of vulnerability, made me worry about predatory crows and cats, made the garden a place of threat, not safety. Though I never searched for nests, I＊d find them, all the same. I＊d be sitting at the kitchen window eating a bowl of Weetabix and I＊d spot a dunnock flit into the forsythia, a mouse-sized bird, all streaks and spots and whispers. I knew I should look away, but I＊d hold my breath at my transgression and track the almost imperceptible movement of leaves as the disappeared bird hopped up and across through twigs to its nest. Then I＊d see the blur of wings as the bird slipped free of the hedge and was gone. And once I＊d determined where it was, and saw that the adults were gone, I needed to know. Most of the nests I found were higher than my head, so I＊d reach my hand up and curl my fingers so their tips touched what might be warm, glossy, smoothness. Or the unbearable fragility of small flesh. I knew I was an intruder. Nests were like bruises: things I couldn＊t help but touch, even though I didn＊t want them to be there. They challenged everything that birds meant for me. I loved them most because they seemed free. Sensing danger, sensing a trap, sensing any kind of imposition, they could fly away. Watching birds, I felt I could share in their freedom. But nests and eggs tied birds down. They made them vulnerable.The old books on birds that lined my childhood shelves described nests as ※bird homes§. This confused me. How could a nest be a home? Back then I thought of homes as fixed, eternal, dependable refuges. Nests were not like that: they were seasonal secrets to be used and abandoned. But then, birds challenged my understanding of the nature of home in so many ways. Some spent the year at sea, or entirely in the air, and felt earth or rock beneath their feet only to make nests and lay eggs that tied them to land. This was all a deeper mystery. It was a story about the way lives should go that was somehow like 每 but not anything like 每 the one I＊d been handed as a child. You grow up, you get married, you get a house, you have children. I didn＊t know where birds fitted into all this. I didn＊t know where I did. It was a narrative that even then gave me pause.I think differently of home, now. It＊s a place that you carry within you, not simply a fixed location. Perhaps birds taught me that, or took me some of the way there. For some birds＊ nests are homes because they seem indivisible from the birds that make them. Rooks are rookeries 每 birds of feathers and bone that are also massed assemblages of twigs in February trees. House martins peering from the entrances of their nests under summer gables are beings of wings and mouths and eyes but also all the architecture of gathered mud. And some birds＊ nests seem so far from nests at all that the word itself drifts and almost loses purchase. The form of one such nest is: chips of old rock and bones and hardened guano, where the overhang supplies shade. The form of another is: a raft of weeds that rises and falls with the ebb and flow of water. Another: a dark space under roof tiles where you can crawl on your mouse feet and your wings drag like feathered blades the colour of carbon steel. Peregrine. Grebe. Swift. These days I wonder about how nests seem to be one kind of entity when they contain eggs and a different kind of entity when they contain chicks. How nests and eggs are good things to think about when considering matters of individuality, and the concepts of same, and different, and series. How the form of a nest is part of the phenotype of a particular bird species, but how local conditions foster beautiful idiosyncracies. How we humans are intrigued when birds make nests out of things that belong to us: house finches lining their nests with cigarette butts, nests of bullock＊s orioles fashioned from twine, kites decorating their tree platforms with underwear stolen from washing lines. A friend of mine found a ferruginous hawk＊s nest wrought almost entirely from lengths of wire. It＊s satisfying to consider the incorporation of human detritus into the creations of birds, but it is troubling, too. What have they made out of what we have made of this world? Our world intersects with theirs and our habitations are strangely shared. We have long rejoiced at birds building nests in unusual places. We love the robin rearing chicks in an old teapot, a hen blackbird sitting tightly on a nest tucked above the stop bulb on a traffic light: these are nests that gesture towards hope, as birds use our things for their own ends, making our technologies redundant, slowed down, static, full of meaning that is no longer entirely our own. But that is what nests are. Their meaning is always woven from things that are partly bird and partly human, and as the cup or wall of a nest is raised, it raises, too, questions about our own lives. Do birds plan like us, or think like us, or really know how to make knots, or slap beaks full of mud in series, or is this merely instinct? Does the structure they＊re making begin with some abstract form, a mental image, to which the bird plans, rather than thinking, step by step, there. That is where that goes? These are questions that pull on us. We make things according to plans, but all of us also have that sense of where things should go. We feel it when we arrange objects on mantelpieces, or furniture in rooms. Artists feel it when they construct collages, when they sculpt, when they bring pigment to bear on a surface, knowing that the dark smear of paint just here provides or provokes a sense of balance or conflict when viewed in relation to the other marks upon the scene. What is it in us? We are fascinated by the difference between skill and instinct, just as we police the differences between art and craft. If pigment is smeared on to a guillemot＊s eggshell as it rotates before being laid in drip-splashes that resemble in their exuberance and finesse the paintings of abstract expressionists, what is our delight in those patterns saying about us? I think of that need to collect that sometimes is billionaires hoarding de Koonings and Pollocks and sometimes welders hiding plastic margarine tubs full of exquisitely marked red-backed shrike eggs beneath beds and floorboards.We see our own notions of home and family in the creatures around us; we process and consider and judge, and prove the truth of our own assumptions from a hall of twigs and mud and shells and feathered mirrors. In science, too, the questions we ask are commonly woven this way. I think of ＊s eminence in the field of ethology 每 and remember, too, his patient attention to the way ritualised gestures appeased aggression in colonies of nesting gulls, and how they related to his anxieties about the relationship between overcrowded cities and human violence. I think of the young , full of all the sexual confusion of youth, spending one spring watching the courtship of great crested grebes, speculating on mutual sexual selection and ritualised behaviour. And I see interwar anxieties about marriage everywhere in Eliot Howard＊s work on bird behaviour; he puzzles over the concept of territory, of nest building, of extra-pair copulations, and is desperately keen to understand the reasons behind the sexual attractiveness of particular females who lure males from their established mates. And in literature, too, everywhere. Nesting birds naturalising the English class system in , where seabird nesting cliffs of auks and kittiwakes make ※an innumerable crowd of fish-wives on the largest grandstand in the world§, exclaiming phrases like ※Is me hat on straight§ and ※Crikey, this isn＊t ＆arf a do!§, while White＊s skeins of aristocratic pink-footed geese pass high over the slum, singing Scandinavian goose-themed sagas as they fly north. Friends of mine who grew up in marginal rural communities mostly have little truck with the mainstream rules of nature appreciation and the laws that enforce them. Most of them hunt with longdogs. Some of them poach game, or trap cock goldfinches to pair with hen canaries, before rearing their young as singing finches called mules. Some of them have collected eggs. Some of them probably still do, though I don＊t get to hear about that. Most have limited financial or social capital, and their claim on the landscape around them is through local field knowledge, rather than literal possession. Egg collecting in this tradition makes me wonder about the terms of ownership, investment and access to pleasure that economically deprived communities are allowed to have in the natural world. I think of Billy, the boy in ＊  who refuses to play football, refuses to work down the mine, rejects all the models of masculinity he＊s given. What opportunities for tenderness does he have? He strokes the backs of baby thrushes in their nest. He keeps a kestrel that he loves. What kinds of beauties can be possessed? If you are a landowner, you get the whole compass of the watered-silk sky and the hedges and the livestock and everything in it. But you＊re a factory worker? There＊s the rub. Egg collecting requires skill, bravery in the field, hard-won knowledge of the natural world. It can become an obsession for minds gripped with stilled beauty. It is a practice that stills time. The collectors grant themselves the power to withhold new lives and new generations. And egg collecting is also, at the same time, a one in the eye for the elite and all their rules about what is and what is not an acceptable way to relate to nature. Egg collecting was especially derided in the cultures of natural history operating during and after the second world war. At that time, British birds were laden with new significance. They were what the nation was made of, what we were fighting for. They became symbolically nationalised; to truly know your birds was to truly know your country, and to be a birdwatcher was a gloriously eccentric, British activity. In this milieu, species with a perilous foothold on British soil, such as avocets, little ringed plovers and ospreys, had their rarity bound up with imperilled nationhood. Thus, the theft of their eggs was now to be seen as an act akin to treason. And protecting the birds from the depredations of collectors was analogous to military service. Again and again, in books and films of this period, injured servicemen who have proved their bravery on the field of battle now show their love for their country by protecting rare birds trying to raise families. JK Stanford＊s , for example, where the threatened nest belongs to avocets, appeared in 1949, four years after the end of the war, and Kenneth Allsop＊s , published the same year, where it belongs to little ringed plovers. The historian of science Sophia Davis has written on how the villains of these books are egg collectors, routinely described as ※vermin§ and ※a menace to England§ and how the nests in their pages are guarded by heroes with the fate of the nation close to their heart. And indeed, gangs of egg protectors guarding the nests of rare birds were a true-life legacy of the war. After years in a German PoW camp, the ornithologist George Waterston sat with his colleagues by the first Scottish osprey nest for 50 years and kept it under observation through the telescopic sights of rifles. And in the 1950s, Stanford wrote of his own experiences guarding avocets. ※Keyed up by the general air of secrecy,§ he wrote, ※we sat till long after dusk, prepared for anything, even an amphibious raid by armed oologists.§ Egg collectors today tend to be characterised as beings in the grip of hopeless addiction, simultaneously suffering from great moral failings. These characterisations were codified in the cultures of postwar ornithology as threats to the body politic. Eggs and war; possession and hope and home. In the 1990s, years after my natural historical collection was disassembled and my childhood home was gone, I worked at a falcon-breeding centre in Wales. In one room were banks of expensive incubators containing eggs. Through the glass, their shells were the mottled browns of walnut, of tea stains, of onion skins. This was before the advent of newer incubators that mimic the press of a brood patch through hot air-filled plastic pouches. These were forced-air incubators with eggs on wire racks. We weighed them each day, and as the embryo moved toward hatching, we＊d candle them: place them on a light and scribe the outline of the shadow against the bright air cell with a soft graphite pencil, so that as the days went past the eggshell was ringed with repeated lines that resembled tides or wide-grained wood. But I always left the incubation room feeling unaccountably upset, with a vague, disquieting sense of vertigo. It was a familiar emotion I couldn＊t quite name. I finally worked out what it was one rainy Sunday afternoon. Leafing through my parents＊ albums I found a photograph of me a few days after my birth, a frail and skinny thing, one arm ringed with a medical bracelet and bathed in stark electric light. I was in an incubator, for I was exceedingly premature. My twin brother did not survive birth. And that early loss, followed by weeks of white light lying alone on a blanket in a Perspex box had done something wrong to me that echoed with a room full of eggs in forced-air boxes, held in moist air and moved by wire. Now I could put a name to the upset I felt. It was loneliness. That was when I recognised the particular power of eggs to raise questions of human hurt and harm. That was why, I realised, the nests in my childhood collection made me uncomfortable; they reached back to a time in my life when the world was nothing but surviving isolation. And then. And then there was a day. One day when, quite by surprise, I discovered that if I held a falcon egg close to my mouth and made soft clucking noises, a chick that was ready to hatch would call back. And there I stood, in the temperature-controlled room. I spoke through the shell to something that had not yet known light or air, but would soon take in the revealed coil and furl of a west-coast breeze and cloud of a hillside in one easy glide at 60 miles an hour, and spire up on sharp wings to soar to see the distant, glittering Atlantic. I spoke through an egg and wept. , an exhibition of films, archive material and found nests, by Andy Holden and Peter Holden, is at the Former Newington Library, London SE17. ."																																																			
"A row of terraced houses in the south  valleys could be demolished after the stretch of road outside their front doors was identified as having the worst air pollution in the UK outside London.Some residents of Woodside Terrace in Crumlin who believe their health is suffering, or despair at the constant roar of traffic, have welcomed the idea of the houses being razed. Others who have invested money, time and love into their homes hope alternatives such as a bypass or restrictions on lorries might be introduced instead. The Guardian  that government data showed the levels of nitrogen dioxide on this stretch of the A472 were exceeded only by part of Marylebone Road in central London. Though the spot in Crumlin is surrounded by fields and hills, the road is a main cross-route between two valleys, carrying more than 21,000 vehicles a day. ※I＊ve had enough,§ said Gloria Matthews, a 60-year-old carer who has lived on Woodside Terrace for 17 years. ※From 6am to 7pm the cars and lorries and vans rumble by. You can feel the vibrations, you can smell the fumes and you can never open your windows. ※It＊s got much worse over the years. Some people live in their cellars now to try to get away from the traffic.§The route is busy with local traffic, commuters travelling to Newport and Cardiff and is a shortcut for lorry drivers keen to avoid the M4, which is often congested, and the Severn Bridge tolls of ?20 for HGVs. Though HGVs and vans represent only 4% of traffic on the road, they account for more than a third of emissions. The geography of this spot in Caerphilly county exacerbates the problem. Even if the road happens to be clear, the steep hill slows the trucks down to a crawl. And the area is hemmed in by the terrace on one side and a hill on the other so that, especially on a still day, the fumes linger.Barbara Smith moved to the road four months ago but has already put her home back on the market (for offers in the region of ?89,950). The estate agent＊s website blurb does not mention the road and the only images are of the interior and back garden.Smith said she had invested ?3,500 on secondary glazing to counter the effects of the road but it did not solve the problem. ※I can＊t sleep, I can＊t breathe. I want to leave.§ and . Options included in a draft action plan include:  Compulsory purchasing homes on Woodside Terrace and demolishing them. Building a bypass. Introducing management measures to help the traffic at least flow more freely. Working with businesses, schools and other bodies to try to encourage more use of public transport and to walk. Reducing the number of lorries on the road.Martin Brown has put up homemade signs asking drivers to slow down. He has lived on the road for almost 50 years but he is in favour of compulsory purchase. ※My suggestion is to knock them all down,§ he said.Deanna Harwick, a mother of two young children, said she could never open her windows, ※so at this time of year the house feels pretty airless§. She believes the value of her home has decreased by up to ?20,000 since she bought it 10 years ago. ※I＊m worried I＊d lose money if there was a compulsory purchase. I＊d favour a bypass,§ Harwick said. The Wales Green party said the health of residents was being sacrificed because lorries and cars had been prioritised over people. The party spokesperson for Gwent, Ian Chandler, said: ※There are no easy answers to this particular problem. Building a new bypass will move some of the pollution away from the most affected houses, but the initial reduced congestion risks encouraging more traffic to use that route and so the problem returns. ※Purchasing and demolishing the homes removes the residents from the problem, but does nothing to reduce overall pollution.§Caerphilly council said it would listen carefully to what residents said they wanted to happen next. Eluned Stenner, a councillor and cabinet member for the environment and public protection, said: ※We remain fully committed to doing all we can to help improve the air quality situation, and I＊d encourage our residents to contribute their views on the contents of this draft action plan by taking part in this consultation.§ Jayne Davies, who has lived on the terrace for 25 years, said she loved her house. ※We＊ve made a lot of improvements over the years. The road is noisy but it＊s lovely out the back, with woods and a stream. So it＊s not all bad. ※I hope they can find a way to improve the road.

"A stretch of coastline which is one of the most important sites in the UK for seabirds such as Arctic terns and Atlantic puffins has been given greater protection. The newly-designated  marine special protected area (SPA) stretches 12 miles from the coast into the North Sea, covering an area larger than 120,000 football pitches, government conservation body Natural England said.The area supports 200,000 seabirds and is the most important site in the UK for Arctic, common and roseate terns, the second most important for sandwich terns and the third most important site for Atlantic puffins, Natural England said. Designation of the SPA under the European Union birds directive builds on existing special protected areas covering seabird breeding sites at Coquet Island, Farne Islands, Lindisfarne and the Northumbria Coast. It will help ensure disturbance to the birds＊ open water feeding areas is minimised and help protect the full range of habitats the seabirds rely on, the conservation agency said. Environment minister Therese Coffey said: ※We already have one of the strongest track records in the world when it comes to looking after our precious marine environment, and today＊s designations will strengthen our blue-belt of protected areas while helping seabirds across the country thrive.§ Andrew Sells, Natural England chairman, said the designation marked a ※momentous day§ for some of the UK＊s best-loved and most charismatic seabirds, many of which had suffered population declines in recent decades. ※These designations will protect vital feeding areas for seabirds along the English coast, creating safe havens to help the birds thrive for generations to come,§ he said. Chris Corrigan, director of RSPB England, said: ※It is fantastic to see these special places being recognised and given the protection they so need and we hope to see more designations in the very near future. ※As the UK moves closer to leaving the EU, we urge the government to continue to recognise the significance of protecting these sites, based on scientific evidence, and that they continue to protect and manage these sites to the same or even higher standards than those currently secured by European law for generations to come.§ Natural England has also announced extensions to Hamford Water SPA in Essex and Morecambe Bay and Duddon Estuary SPA in Cumbria, adding an area bigger than 150,000 football pitches to the existing marine protected area network.

"e can＊t stop looking at human faces. Can＊t stop being interested in ourselves, our species. The BP Portrait Award, whose annual exhibition of winners and strong contenders can be seen at the  until 24 September, is full of humanity. It is, perhaps, the most  art prize in the world, an art award that specifically celebrates the painted human image and looks for modern heirs to the profoundly compassionate tradition of portraiture that includes Rembrandt, Vel芍zquez and Lucian Freud.Yet it may be time to get over ourselves. Has the moment come to put nature before portraiture, and abolish this oil-tainted oil painting prize?Protests against , probably the world＊s most reviled oil company since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, are regularly staged outside its annual prize giving ceremony. Now the pressure is being ramped up a notch.For the first time, the Guardian has learned, . Henry Christian-Slane, 26, from New Zealand, won this year＊s BP young artist award, one of five prizes in the open submission contest. He＊s donating ?1,000 of the ?7,000 he received to Greenpeace, to support ※projects that aim to protest BPs further extraction of fossil fuels from the Earth§.Christian-Slane is not calling for the end of this art prize 每 that would be a bit hypocritical, having entered it 每 yet his gesture undoubtedly turns a harsh spotlight on the BP Portrait Award＊s oil funding at a time when BP arts patronage is under attack. Tate＊s relationship with the oil and gas extractor has ended (for non-climate related reasons, insists BP) and  for other arts organisations accepting its sponsorship. I should probably declare an interest. I accepted an invitation to be  . I did not get paid anything, but I did have a nice dinner and happily sat on the judging panel of six with a voting BP representative. Since our arguments got quite heated, her vote mattered.It is sometimes argued that BP arts sponsorship is a fake publicity stunt that museums can easily do without 每 after a long relationship with Tate  每 but if that is the rule, the BP Portrait Award may well be an exception. It isn＊t so much the money 每 no doubt that is peanuts for BP 每 as the quirkiness and originality of this particular prize that makes the oil company＊s involvement look almost 每 I hate to say this 每 idealistic. Painted portraiture is, after all, not exactly a fashionable art form. None of the people who enter this prize are ever likely to be shortlisted for the more stylish Turner 每 I＊ve judged that too and can attest that the chances of a portraitist winning it are close to zero. Painting people well is hard, and in the cooler regions of the art world, unrewarding 每 yet in spite of that, so much of the truly great art of our time, such as Freud＊s portraits of Leigh Bowery and , has come from cussed sods who do it anyway. Freud worked all his life to get that good. I can＊t help being grateful to BP for giving a bit of its dosh to Christian-Slane for . It is young painters like him who may become the Freuds of the future 每 and frankly they do not get much encouragement or fame outside this art prize.Then again, how much do portraits matter? How much does art itself matter? I think the debate about BP sponsorship of the arts is dishonest if it does not ask these bigger questions. It＊s all very well bullying art galleries 每 that are struggling, not just to survive in a harsh economic climate but to stay free as the British public expects 每 to divest themselves of BP support. The reality is that if we＊re making it harder for the arts, we should be prepared to say some things matter more than art. And they do.One of the Greenpeace campaigns that will benefit from Christian-Slane＊s cash is its effort to save a newly discovered coral reef at the mouth of the Amazon. This 600 mile reef, which was a kind of scientific legend, an oceanographic rumour, . The images taken from its submersible are wonderlands of colour and abundance 每 a beauty no artist created. This is, however, a beauty that humans can easily destroy. And guess what: BP is one of the oil companies targeting the area. It  before August 2018§. It claims that its operation about 22 miles from the magical corals and their denizens will be completely safe. Uh-huh.Looking at the wonder of this unique reef 每 it exists in exactly the kind of murky waters that are not meant to support corals 每 it is impossible for me to claim a painting matters as much. As the great, campaigning Victorian art critic John Ruskin pointed out, human art can never hope to match the grandeur of nature. The sky is brighter than any painting, the sea 每 as we can observe in images of this reef 每 more mysterious than any human fantasy. Without nature there can be no art. It is blind and narrow for arts organisations to pretend they are outside the struggle to save nature. So make this a turning point. A young artist has bitten the oily hand that feeds the BP Portrait Award and he＊s surely started something. If artists don＊t want BP＊s money how can the National Portrait Gallery keep offering it? Tellingly, the first sponsor of this prize . It seems it＊s always the controversial businesses that spend on the arts 每 the saintly ones don＊t crave the publicity. Today it would be unimaginable for museums to take tobacco money. Perhaps museums need to find the next sponsors who need to clean up a dodgy image 每 soft drinks giants, maybe?It is not true that you can cut off a source of money to museums without harming art. Without BP there might be no portrait award. So let＊s tell it truthfully: in the interest of the planet, art will just have to lose face."																																																			
"It is well known that humans are causing the Earth to warm. We also know that a warmer atmosphere has more water vapor. Just like the air is more humid when it is warm, and less humid when cold. The more humid air leads to more intense precipitation and potentially more flooding. But how much change we will see is an open scientific question.This question is made complex by the fact that flooding isn＊t just about rain. It reflects a dependence on evaporation, rain, the ability of land and water management to handle water surges, and other factors. Fortunately, a very recent  has helped  of the confluence of global warming, intense rain and flooding. The authors, Conrad Wasko and Ashish Sharma, from the University of New South Wales investigated various non-urban catchments. These are regions where precipitation drains to a common site. We know that in many places the rainfall is increasing. What these authors wanted to know was whether there was a coincident increase in floods found in these various catchments.This study isn＊t as simple as it might sound. The authors had to make choices about which rainfall event and which temperature peak corresponded to each other and to a potential water flow peak. According to the paper, ※precipitation events were identified where the precipitation was separated by five days of zero rainfall.§ That is, it had to be dry ahead of time. Streamflow and flooding events were selected as peaks separated by more than seven days. The authors then picked the largest peak from the precipitation and the streamflow observations and matched them to a coincident temperature measurement. The tough part is that there can be a delay in temperatures and precipitation. Furthermore, there can be a physical distance between the source of the storm and the location of precipitation. Finally, many times we see flooding without the required five-day dry period. So admittedly this study has real limitations. On the other hand, the authors had to make some choices of selection and these are as good as any others. And, they compensated for these limitations by using extensive rainfall, temperature and streamflow data, data that represented the entire world and allows confident conclusions to be drawn.What they found was that in most cases there is no direct link. That is, higher temperatures does not generally cause an increase in water flow or flood risk. So this begs the question, why not? Why isn＊t there a clear direct relationship between the temperature peaks and flooding? Well the authors explain that there is an important role of hydrologic loss (water loss due to evaporation for instance). When the authors separated the results by size of catchment, they found that the importance of these water losses was reduced for smaller catchment areas. They write:When they broke the analysis into different catchment sizes, the authors found that for extreme rainfalls, the flooding and temperature move together. The authors also broke analysis into different geographical zones and found that their conclusions held true, regardless of the zone location.As I stated earlier, there are limitations to this study; the authors did a great job discussing those limitations. For instance, they point out it＊s possible that human changes to the catchment itself can affect flooding. Urbanization in recent years may have ※increased streamflow due to a larger proportion of impermeable surfaces while the development of dams for storage may have had the opposite effect.§ They also report that the temperature at which the high water flows are recorded do not necessarily correspond to the temperature of the storm. Evaporation can happen for instance over an ocean, the moisture can be carried hundreds of miles inland, where it falls as rain. But, the fact that their results exclude urban catchments and use data from over 5,000 streamflow and 50,000 rainfall gauges lends credibility to their assertions.So is this good news or bad news? Well, on the one hand it confirms that global warming leads to competing effects of more heavy rains and more drying of land 每 forces in opposition to each other. Higher temperatures dry out soils faster and they increase precipitation. If the soils are dryer when the rains fall, it means that the floods may be less severe. That is a good thing. On the other hand, this study helps confirm that the Earth can move from dry to wet conditions more rapidly in a warmer environment. That is not a good thing. It also has implications for refilling groundwater supplies. Much of the recovery from drought and refilling of groundwater is through smaller flooding/high-flow events. Since those are not necessarily increasing, it means droughts are likely to linger.As author Ashish Sharma told me:"																																																			
" could wipe out a third of all parasite species on Earth, according to the most comprehensive analysis to date.Tapeworms, roundworms, ticks, lice and fleas are feared for the diseases they cause or carry, but scientists warn that they also play a vital role in ecosystems. Major extinctions among parasites could lead to unpredictable invasions of surviving parasites into new areas, affecting wildlife and humans and making a ※significant contribution§ to the sixth mass extinction already under way on Earth.The new research, , used the collection of 20m parasites held at the Smithsonian Institution＊s Museum of National History in the US to map the global distribution of 457 parasites. The scientists then applied a range of climate models and future scenarios and found that the average level of extinctions as habitats become unsuitable for parasites was 10% by 2070, but extinctions rose to a third if the loss of host species was also included.※It is a staggering number,§ said Colin Carlson at the University of California, Berkeley, who led the new work. ※Parasites seem like one of the most threatened groups on Earth.§ The severity of the impact varied with the different climate scenarios. For example, a 20% loss of parasite native ranges in scenarios where carbon emissions are rapidly cut in the future rises to 37% if emissions continue unchecked. ※Parasites are obviously a hard sell,§ said Carlson. ※Even if you are grossed out by them 每 and there are obviously downsides for individual hosts and for humans 每 parasites play a huge role in ecosystems.§ They provide up to 80% of the food web links in ecosystems, he said. Having a wide range of parasites in an ecosystem also means they compete with one another, which can help slow down the spread of diseases. ※If parasites go extinct, we are looking at a potential massive destabilisation of ecosystems [which] could have huge unexpected consequences,§ Carlson said, with other parasites moving in to take advantage. ※That doesn＊t necessarily work out well for anyone, wildlife or humans.§ One example of the complex role parasites can play is a  in Japan and tends to lead its host to jump into water, where the grasshoppers become a major food source for rare fish. ※In some subtle ways, parasites are puppeteers,§ Carlson said.The research analysed more than 50,000 records of the 457 parasite species, which the researchers believe provides a representative picture. But, with more than 300,000 species of parasitic worms alone known to exist, working out the specific impact of parasite extinctions on diseases is complex and remains to be done.※It is difficult to summarise the net consequence, as we know so little about most parasites,§ Carlson said. ※Climate change will make some parasites extinct and make some do better. But we would argue the overall phenomenon is dangerous, because extinctions and invasions go hand in hand.§Anna Phillips, the curator of the Smithsonian＊s parasite collection, said: ※As long as there are free-living organisms, there will be parasites. But the picture of parasite biodiversity in 2070 or beyond has the potential to look very different than it does today based on these results.§"																																																			
"The government has given the go-ahead for the first trials of convoys of semi-automated trucks on UK motorways.Up to three wirelessly connected HGVs will travel in convoy, with acceleration, braking and steering controlled by the lead vehicle, a concept named platooning. Each lorry will have a driver in the cab ready to retake control at any time. The government is providing ?8.1m in funding for trials of the technology. The Department for  (DfT) and Highways England have yet to confirm where the first tests will be carried out, but said they were expected on major roads by the end of 2018. Proponents say platooning could cut both congestion and the cost of fuel for hauliers, although motoring organisations have voiced concerns about safety, particularly on motorways.The DfT said the technology could have major benefits, with vehicles in the slipstream using less fuel, lowering emissions and improving air quality.The transport minister Paul Maynard said: ※We are investing in technology that will improve people＊s lives. ※Advances such as lorry platooning could benefit businesses through cheaper fuel bills and other road users thanks to lower emissions and less congestion.※But first we must make sure the technology is safe and works well on our roads, and that＊s why we are investing in these trials.§An earlier attempt to launch tests in the UK, , stalled after a fruitless search for a HGV manufacturer to participate. The platooning trial will be conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), which has been involved in other tests of driverless vehicles, including  and autonomous delivery pods for online shopping. The chief executive of TRL, Rob Wallis, said: ※The UK has an unprecedented opportunity to lead the world in trialling connected vehicle platoons in a real-world environment.§Similar trials have been successfully  and Europe.  saw platoons of connected trucks travelling from Germany, Sweden and Belgium converge in Rotterdam.However, motoring organisations fear platoons could obscure signs and exits on Britain＊s crowded roads, particularly since the hard shoulders on converted ※smart§ motorways are now being used for regular traffic. The president of the AA, Edmund King, said the government had listened to their concerns and decided against a planned pilot scheme on the M6. ※We all want to promote fuel efficiency and reduced congestion but we are not yet convinced that lorry platooning on UK motorways is the way to go about it,§ King said. ※We have some of the busiest motorways in Europe with many more exits and entries. Platooning may work on the miles of deserted freeways in Arizona or Nevada but this is not America. ※A platoon of just three HGVs can obscure road signs from drivers in the outside lanes and potentially make access to entries or exits difficult for other drivers. Even a three-truck platoon is longer than half a Premier League football pitch.§The Road Haulage Association said it would be following the trials very carefully. Its chief executive, Richard Burnett, said: ※Of course we welcome improvements to the way the road freight industry works and we understand the benefits that such a mode of operation would bring. ※However, currently the focus seems to be on the technology behind the system. Safety has to come first and it cannot be compromised. It is crucial that this element of the concept gets the highest priority.§Highways England suggested platooning could make journeys safer. Jim O＊Sullivan, the chief executive, said: ※Investing in this research shows we care about those using our roads, the economy and the environment, and safety will be integral as we take forward this work with TRL.§"																																																			
"Logging has begun in trees inhabited by the threatened greater gliders in a forest also inhabited by Victoria＊s faunal emblem, the threatened Leadbeater＊s possum.Protections for  每 believed to be fewer than 2,500 breeding individuals left in the wild 每 mean logging will be halted within 200m of known colonies. But no such protection exists for the greater gliders, which have been listed as threatened by both state and .On the evenings of 18 and 19 August, citizen scientists recorded the presence of seven greater gliders in an area of the Toolangi state forest in the central highlands of , which was earmarked for logging by VicForests.The report was emailed to VicForests, as well as relevant Victorian ministers and departments on 28 August. It is understood that logging had started in the area by then, and has continued with no regard given to the known greater glider population.A spokeswoman for the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning replied to the email about the sighting, saying: ※DELWP is still determining our interim protection measures for greater gliders and your report will help inform this work.§Danya Jacobs, a lawyer at Environmental Justice Australia, said the government was required to make an ※action statement§ as soon as possible after an animal is listed as threatened.Greater gliders were listed as threatened under federal law in May 2017, with habitat loss listed as a major threat . Timber production in particular was noted as a threat, since ※prime habitat coincides largely with areas suitable for logging§.※The government can and should use powers that are available to it to urgently prohibit logging where this species occurs,§ Jacobs said.Lilly D＊Ambrosio, Victoria＊s minister for energy environment and climate change told Guardian Australia the Victorian government was working on protecting the greater glider ※as a priority§ and interim measures were being finalised to be put in place while longer-term protections are developed.She said the draft action statement would be published in early 2018, with the public invited to comment on it.Sightings of Leadbeater＊s possums by the same group of citizen scientists in the area has resulted in a buffer of 200m around the known colonies, a legal requirement made to protect the threatened species.A  found that even with these protections, the Leadbeater＊s possums had only a 45% chance of surviving.But a new  of that protection measure by John Woinarski from Charles Darwin University found the population is still very likely to be wiped out, since that calculation assumed ※an implausible future scenario of 200 years without bushfire§.※When a single bushfire is factored into the analysis, the population within the conservation reserve system, including [timber harvesting exclusion zones policy], is far more likely than not to become quasi-extinct,§ Woinarski wrote. (※Quasi-extinct§ is defined as when the population drops below a viable threshold.)The report has been published by the Victorian government, which says it is considering it ※and will respond in due course§.Jacobs said: ※Gambling the future of Victoria＊s faunal emblem on the slim hope that the central highlands might go 200 years without a bushfire is completely irresponsible.§While the 200m logging exclusion zones around known colonies can stop those individual possums from being killed immediately, the surrounding logging leaves the possums vulnerable to bushfires, with less habitat to escape into.※Leadbeater＊s possum was hit very hard by the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009,§ said Jacobs. ※The effort to prevent the species＊ extinction is directly linked to protecting its remaining habitat.※While the government cannot guarantee 200 years without bushfires, it could greatly improve the survival chances of Leadbeater＊s possum by prohibiting logging in the possum＊s home forests.§A joint RSPCA-WWF report finds tree clearing in  is the state＊s biggest animal welfare issue, killing 34m animals each year in the state, many of which die a painful death.※Nothing else in Queensland causes as much suffering and death among animals as the escalating destruction of bushland habitat by bulldozers and other machinery,§ said Mark Townend from the RSPCA.※This is due to a gaping hole in our legislative safeguards allowing huge areas of forest to be bulldozed with no requirement to consider or reduce the impact on the animals living there,§ Townend said.The report found that between 2009 and 2014, more than 10,000 koalas were admitted to the four south-east Queensland wildlife hospitals, out of a population of only 15,000 estimated in 2010.Dermot O＊Gorman, chief executive of WWF-Australia, said bulldozing of habitat was a major factor in the 80% decline of koalas in Queensland＊s Koala Coast.※Even if they escape the grinding bulldozers and crashing trees, native animals face deprivation and death crowding into remaining habitats that are already full.§The two organisations called for stronger restrictions on land clearing, mandatory relocation of wildlife in tree-clearing projects, and enhanced funding for wildlife rescue services."																																																			
"One of the best sites in England for endangered nightingales will not be covered in 5,000 new houses after a long campaign by environmental charities.The planning application to build on the former Ministry of Defence site of , Kent, has been withdrawn ahead of a public inquiry into the controversial development.But the site is still at risk after the local council reacted furiously to the decision and declared it would welcome new applications to build on the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) as soon as possible.More than 12,000 people objected to the application to build on the SSSI, one of the country＊s best wildlife sites, which national planning guidelines say can only be destroyed if development is proven to be in the national interest.The  but the plans were referred to central government and a public inquiry was due to be held in spring next year.Conservationists have welcomed the reprieve for , which is still owned by the Ministry of Defence, but the site is still earmarked for housing under Medway council＊s local plan.The leader of the Conservative-controlled council, Alan Jarrett, said he was ※appalled§ at the delay in developing the site and said the ※people of Medway§ had been ※let down§ by a succession of agencies.He added: ※While I am hugely disappointed that the current scheme for Lodge Hill has been withdrawn, I now eagerly await the new plans expected to be put forward by the applicants in the coming months.※By 2035 we must build 30,000 new homes to keep up with our expanding population and therefore each and every suitable development site is key.§The disused barracks contain ancient woodland and have become a UK stronghold for nightingales, with up to 85 singing males recorded on the site.

"Adani has chosen to fight a $12,900 fine by the  government for the unauthorised release of coal-laden stormwater into the sea at its Abbot Point port during a cyclone in March.The Indian energy giant has given notice to the state environment department that it intends to contest the modest penalty infringement notice in court, the Guardian can reveal.Environmental groups had lambasted the fine, which was issued on 20 July for a technical breach of a floodwater release permit, as a slap on the wrist. Kelly O＊Shanassy, the Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive, said Adani was now ※having a laugh§ after they ※barely got a slap on the wrist§ for the environmental licence breach.※For a multibillion-dollar multinational to challenge such a meagre fine shows real contempt for the Queensland and Australian public,§ she said.※If this is their attitude now, what will it be like it they are allowed to construct a massive dirty new coalmine that would contribute to the destruction of our Great Barrier Reef and threaten our planet with more carbon pollution?§An Adani company that operates the port dumped water containing more than eight times the permitted amount of sediment during  on 27 March. Adani reported the breach to the government 10 days later.Adani had far exceeded the ※generous conditions§ of a special licence to dump polluted water into the ocean during Cyclone Debbie, O＊Shanassy said.The company could still face a separate multimillion-dollar fine if found guilty of causing environmental harm from a release of polluted water into the neighbouring Caley Valley wetlands.That release is still subject to an ongoing investigation, according to the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection.A spokeswoman for the department said on Thursday a court date for Adani＊s challenge to the fine had not yet been set.Adani has flagged spending $22bn on Australia＊s largest coal project in Queensland＊s Galilee basin.The infringement notice was issued to Abbot Point Bulk  Pty Ltd, a company which its Indian-listed parent has been trying to sell to a tax haven company linked to the Adani family for more than four years.The Abbot Point operator was granted a temporary licence to discharge stormwater with up to 100mg a litre of ※suspended solids§ as high rainfall from Debbie lashed the north Queensland coast.But the company told the department it had breached the licence with a release recording sediment at 806mg a litre.※The company＊s environmental authority and [temporary emissions licence] contained strict conditions that should have been adhered to in ensuring the environment was protected, especially during extreme weather events,§ the department said in a statement to Guardian Australia after issuing the fine.※Temporary emissions licences and environmental authorities are not taken lightly by the department and there can be harsh penalties for companies that breach their approvals.§The Guardian sought comment from two spokesmen for Adani in Australia.Adani has previously rejected claims by conservationists that  and possibly coastal waters near the Great Barrier Reef marine park.The environment department＊s director general, Jim Reeves, has  through licence breaches included fines of up to $3.8m for deliberate breaches and $2.7m for accidents."																																																			
																																																			
"One of the country＊s most important horticultural gardens is under threat from a road-widening scheme, the Royal Horticultural Society has said. Wisley, a grade II*-listed RHS garden in Surrey, could lose 10,000 sq metres (2.5 acres) of woodland and 500 trees 每 including endangered species and giant redwoods 每 if proposals are approved. Improvements to junction 10 of the M25 include proposals to widen the A3 in Surrey. Two options are being considered by Highways England to widen the road, one on the east side, and one on the west alongside the 120-year-old gardens. The western option would involve removing a bank of trees that separates the road from the garden. The RHS says this would worsen noise and air pollution at the gardens and destroy the habitats of a wide range of wildlife, including birds, moths, badgers, beetles and moles. The charity claims that trees more than 100 years old, five trees identified as ※threatened and endangered in cultivation§, a tree planted by the Queen Mother, and giant redwoods are among those that would be lost if the ※short-sighted road improvement scheme§ went ahead.Calling on the government to opt for the alternative proposals for the A3＊s expansion, on the road＊s east side, Sue Biggs, the RHS＊s director general, said it would be criminal to cut down historic trees when another viable option was available.TV presenter and RHS ambassador Alan Titchmarsh said the potential ※garden grabbing plan§ would be another example of the government＊s poor perception of horticulture and ※lack of appreciation of the vital role that plants play for the environment, for the nation＊s health and wellbeing and for the UK economy§. ※Wisley is the UK＊s centre of excellence for horticulture and horticultural science and helps millions of people to garden and grow plants,§ he said. ※I＊m calling on the UK＊s army of 27 million gardeners to make it known that a disregard for these important trees and lack of appreciation of the national importance of this garden would not be acceptable if the shortsighted and environmentally damaging option was chosen. We must stand together and protect our gardens.§The gardens at Wisley in Surrey is one of four run by the RHS, the others being Harlow Carr, Hyde Hall and Rosemoor. It is the second most visited paid entry garden in the UK, after the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, receiving 1.2 million visitors a year.Garden Wisley was first created by a businessman and scientist, George Fergusson Wilson. He bought the site in 1878 and established the Oakwood experimental garden, with the idea of making difficult plants grow successfully. After his death in 1902, the garden was bought by Sir Thomas Hanbury, a wealthy Quaker who had founded the renowned garden of La Mortola, on the Italian Riviera. In 1903, Hanbury gave the estate to the RHS.※We＊re investing more than ?70m into RHS Garden Wisley in horticulture, new laboratories, learning buildings and visitor facilities, making the garden an even more important centre for science, and a better place to visit,§ Biggs said.※The role these trees play in mitigating pollution, giving a home to wildlife and providing a visual and noise barrier to preserve the peace and productivity of the garden cannot, and must not, be underestimated. ※We are seriously concerned how the noise of the A3 without the trees would impact on our visitors and, therefore, on the future of the garden.§ Hugh Coakley, a project manager at Highways England, said: ※Highways England cares about the environment, and protecting the special habitats around Wisley is a priority for us as we develop our proposals for major improvements at the junction of the M25 and A3 in Surrey. It is one of the busiest motorway junctions in the country, and upgrading it will improve people＊s journeys and make both roads safer.※Both the options we consulted on in the winter include better, safer access to Wisley gardens and we will continue to work closely with RHS Wisley as we take the project forward. We look forward to announcing the results of the consultation soon.§"																																																			
"hree decades ago when serious debate on human-induced climate change began globally, a great deal of statesmanship was on display. A preparedness to recognise that this was an issue which transcended nation states, ideologies and political parties. An issue which had to be addressed proactively in the long-term interests of humanity, even if the existential nature of climate risk was far less clear cut than it is today.Then, as global institutions were put in place to take up this challenge and the extent of change this would impose on the fossil-fuel dominated world became more obvious, the forces of resistance mobilised. Today, despite the diplomatic triumph of the , debate around climate change policy has never been more dysfunctional, indeed Orwellian, particularly in Australia.In his book Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell describes a double-speak totalitarian state where most of the population accepts ※the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane.§Orwell could have been writing about climate change and policymaking. International agreements talk of limiting global warming to 1.5每2∼C, but in reality they set the world on a path of 3每5∼C. Goals are reaffirmed, only to be abandoned. Coal, by definition, is ※clean§. Just 1∼C of warming is already dangerous, but this cannot be said. The planetary future is hostage to myopic, national self-interest. Action is delayed on the assumption that as yet unproven technologies will save the day, decades hence. The risks are existential, but it is ※alarmist§ to say so. A one-in-two chance of missing a goal is normalised as reasonable.Climate policymaking for years now has been cognitively dissonant, ※a flagrant violation of reality§. So the lack of understanding among the public and elites of the full measure of the climate challenge is unsurprising. Yet most Australians sense where we are heading: three-quarters of people see climate change as a catastrophic risk and half see our way of life ending within the next 100 years. The previous norms of statesmanship and long-term thinking have long since disappeared, replaced by an obsession with short-term political and commercial advantage, particularly where climate and energy policy is concerned.An emergency-scale transition to a post-fossil fuel world is essential to address climate change. But this is considered to be too disruptive. The orthodoxy is that there is time for an orderly economic transition within the current short-termist political paradigm. Discussion of what would be safe 每 less warming that we presently experience 每 is non-existent. And so we have a policy failure of epic proportions.In the magical thinking of Australian policymakers, a pathway of gradual change, constructed over many decades in a growing, prosperous, coal-fired world stretches enticingly before us. The world not imagined is the one that now exists: of looming financial instability; of a global crisis of political legitimacy; of a sustainability crisis that extends far beyond climate change to include all the fundamentals of human existence, and of severe global energy sector dislocation.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the UN in 1988 and charged with regularly assessing the global consensus on climate science as a basis for policy-making. The IPCC assessment reports produced every five to six years play a critical part in the public framing of the climate narrative. The IPCC has done indispensable work in pulling together a periodic consensus of what must be the most exhaustive scientific investigation in history. However, the process suffers from all the dangers of consensus-building in such a wide-ranging and complex arena. For example, its reports, of necessity, do not always contain the latest available information. Consensus-building can lead to ※least drama§ lowest-common-denominator outcomes which overlook critical issues, particularly the implications of the ※fat-tails§ of probability distributions, namely high impact but relatively low-probability events where scientific knowledge is limited. Vested interest pressure is acute; climate denialists accuse the IPCC of alarmism, whereas climate action proponents consider the IPCC to be far too conservative. To cap it all, the IPCC conclusions are subject to intense political oversight before being released, which has had the effect of substantially watering down sound scientific findings. These limitations were not of overriding importance in earlier years. However, it is now clear that the risks are far greater than previously anticipated. Climate change has moved from the twilight period of much talk but limited impact; it is now turning nasty, as witnessed with Hurricanes  and , in , and not to forget  in Australia earlier this year.The distinction between climate science and risk is now the critical issue, for the two are not the same. Scientific reticence, the reluctance to spell out the full risk implications of climate science in the absence of perfect information, has become a major problem, allowing politicians to ignore the real dangers we face. But waiting for perfect information means it will be too late to act, as any sensible risk manager or military leader knows only too well. Like an iceberg, there is great danger in ignoring ※What lies beneath§.The irresponsible invective passing for political debate on climate and energy policy is replete with assurances that politicians are devoted to ensuring the security of the Australian people. Nothing could be further from the truth. Those assurances are meaningless unless climate risk is honestly addressed and that must happen long before we are confronted with our own equivalent of Irma. At present that risk is totally ignored."																																																			
"ecent days have seen Houston, Texas literally sunk under sheer weight of rain, Carribbean islands battered by powerful storms barrelling across the Gulf and now . It seems almost certain that man-made climate change has a role in such events. Scientists used to be circumspect at attributing any. No longer. The unmistakeable fingerprint of extreme weather at the crime scene of global warming seems intuitively obvious: consider that Houston is reckoned to have been hit by . A 500-year flood does not have to happen only twice a millennium. But a run of three indicates that past climate is no longer a reliable guide to the present weather. The explanation is that the climate itself is changing.Such thinking should be a wake up call for the world, which has to understand how profoundly we must make a shift in the way we produce, distribute and consume energy, and how disruptive this will be for the real economy. While governments have, via the Paris agreement, signalled the end of the fossil-fuel era, the political processes by which states will decide how to meet their mitigation targets have been hijacked and influenced by Big Carbon.Fossil-fuel companies, hydrocarbon billionaires and their allies, particularly in the west,  to mislead voters about the environmental harm caused by carbon pollution. They have good reason to: a  revealed 50 corporations account for more than one-fifth of all carbon released into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began. The groundbreaking research not only helps establish legal accountability for climate change, it also weakens any corporate defence of wilful blindness. A major polluter cannot say it was going ahead with its activities because it was unaware its products caused great harm. Corporations have made handsome profits as the globe ended up a degree warmer than it should be. These polluters privatised the fossil-fuel profits and socialised the cost to the world＊s poor, global taxpayers and future generations. Big Carbon entities and individuals who claim their lobbying activities are just an expression of their democratic rights sound a lot like Big Tobacco when it was denying the health dangers of smoking.. First in the Philippines, where it is being determined whether polluters violated the human rights of Filipinos for their role in creating the conditions for Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest ever tropical storm to make landfall, which left more than 7,000 dead. Second in Germany, where a German utility company is being sued for costs associated with glacial lake flooding in Peru. Last in the US, , claiming they knew their products would cause sea-level rise and coastal flooding, but failed to reduce their greenhouse gases.Fossil-fuel companies should be held accountable for the effects of climate change. Legal warfare has a two-fold aim: to overhaul transgressors＊ business models so that they are in line with the global commitment to phase out fossil fuels and limit temperature rises to 1.5∼C; and to get them to pay for damages resulting from global warming. Climate litigation is the inevitable result of a failure of two decades of talks. But it is also an important way of reframing the climate crisis as a human rights emergency."																																																			
"Wild tigers are to be reintroduced to  70 years after they became extinct in the country.The animals will be reintroduced in the Ili-Balkhash region in a project that involves the creation of a nature reserve and the restoration of a forest that is part of the animal＊s historical range. If successful, Kazakhstan will be the first country in the world to bring wild tigers back to an entire region where they have been extinct for nearly half a century. Previous relocation projects have only been considered in existing tiger habitats, such as in reserves in India.Poaching and habitat loss has decimated the wildlife on which wild tigers once fed, including the , or wild donkey, and bactrian deer, both native to central Asia. The animals will be reintroduced to the nature reserve to provide enough food for the tigers when they are relocated from elsewhere in Asia.The project, which is being supported by WWF, is likely to take many years. The landscape has to be prepared and the wildlife they feed on reintroduced before the first tigers are brought in in 2025 at the earliest.Igor Chestin, the director of WWF-Russia said: ※Thanks to years of close collaboration between Kazakhstan and Russian conservation experts, we have now identified the best possible territory in Ili-Balkhash for the restoration of a thriving wild tiger population.※Our continued cooperation will be key in the successful creation of a new reserve, the restoration of rare native species and, in a few years＊ time, achieving anunprecedented trans-boundary relocation of wild tigers to central Asia.§Since the beginning of the 20th century, wild tigers have lost more than 90% of their historical range, including in central Asia (modern Turkey and Iran to north-west China). Wild tigers completely disappeared from Kazakhstan in the 1940s due to poaching and the loss of territory, WWF said. There were thought to be about 100,000 wild tigers at the beginning of the 20th century. Now there are about 3,900, but it is hoped the Kazakhstan project will play a key role in increasing tiger range and populations.Askar Myrzakhmetov, the minister of agriculture, said: ※Kazakhstan is moving along the path of green development. We are honoured to be the first country in central Asia to implement such an important and large-scale project, that not only will bring wild tigers back to their ancestral home but also protect the unique ecosystem of the Ili-Balkhash region.§Ekaterina Vorobyeva, the director of WWF-Russia＊s Central Asia programme, said there was hard work ahead to make the area ready. ※That means tackling poaching and illegal activities, having well-trained and equipped rangers, thriving prey populations and engaged local communities.§"

"After enduring weeks of overcast skies and squally showers, hordes of visitors had evidently spent the day , making the most of the long-awaited sunshine.A confetti of carelessly discarded sweet and ice lolly wrappers littered the path to the 22-acre Heath Pond. The bins were overflowing with bottles, cans and fast food packaging, but rather than taking their rubbish home people had resorted to dumping bags of picnic detritus beside them. As I watched a  tug the ham out of a half-eaten sandwich, I noticed movement inside one of the supermarket carriers. The plastic bulged, and a stocky brown rat squeezed out from between the loosely knotted handles. Two lithe youngsters slunk out of the bramble thicket, and the trio began scrabbling through the cornucopia of scraps. Just as the adult sniffed out a browning apple core, a German shepherd puppy came loping towards them. The juvenile rats galloped towards the lake and leapt into the silt-clouded water. Paddling out to an overhanging willow, they each shinned up a whippy branch with squirrel-like agility. Unwilling to abandon its prize, the adult sank its yellow incisors into the fruit and skittered through the reed bed, disappearing into a bolthole beneath the boardwalk. While domesticated ※fancy rats§ are praised for their cleanliness, intelligence and sociability, their wild counterparts are perceived as dirty, disease-ridden vermin. True, humans are susceptible to a host of rat-borne pathogens and, as well as spreading disease, causes significant economic damage to property and crops, and . However, it is important to recognise that brown rat ecology is inextricably linked with our own 每 we can＊t blame these opportunistic animals for exploiting humankind＊s pervasive slovenliness and antisocial behaviour.  By the boat-hire hut, where mute swans, mallards and Egyptian geese congregate, a sign urged visitors not to feed the wildfowl, in order to avoid attracting rodents. Beyond the sign, foraging trails of star-like splay-toed prints surrounded the hotdog buns, hunks of granary cob and anaemic-looking crusts of sliced white that lay mouldering on the muddy bank. It was clear that, until we clean up our act, we are extending rats an open invitation."																																																			
" strange consequence of all the recent  in the US has been, for a very brief period, Donald Trump seeming if not adequate, then at least a calamity that falls below the level of a category five hurricane. That hiatus ended this week with his , removing the limited protection previously offered to illegal child immigrants. But for those few, short days, the worst he seemed to have done was attend a flood zone with a wife wearing stilettos.Floods always seem biblical, but the storms in the southern and central parts of the US are given an extra dimension by the wildlife. With Harvey, and no doubt with Irma when it reaches Florida this week, the thing that makes these disasters seem less like a weather event and more like something from the pages of JG Ballard, or the Old Testament, is the presence of snakes in the water.Animal experts make the point that during floods, animals, like humans, seek higher ground, and this drives them into populated areas and people＊s homes and attics. In Houston, most of the snakes washing up in people＊s houses weren＊t venomous; ※only§ five of more than 20 species in the greater Houston area represent a danger to people.

(No one bitten tested positive for rabies.)Fear of rabies can mimic the symptoms of the virus itself. At the bus stop the other day, a woman standing next to me with a large dog, on a leash, watched in horror as it nipped a passer-by. The man went insane. It was amazing. He had every right to be angry, but he lost it in a way I＊d never seen before, not even among people fighting over a parking space: swearing at her, demanding to see the dog＊s rabies certificate, then jogging off again, cradling his arm and muttering, like someone suffering from the disease.The struggle to evacuate Florida before the hurricane wasn＊t helped by airlines jacking up the prices, but even without that, the ability to plan ahead seems to be one with which many of us increasingly struggle. We are constantly advised to ※live in the moment§, but one of these days we are going to be incapable of doing anything else. Phones obviate the need to be on time; checking a map before setting out has become obsolete. In the car at the weekend, I had a moment of panic when I realised we were completely dependent on the navigation system and had no larger sense of where we were, where we＊d been, or where we were going, which, on reflection. It was perhaps an accurate assessment of where we are now. Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"																																																			
"A high-flying species of duck reaches altitudes of up to 6,800 metres (22,000ft) to cross the Himalayas, research from a British university has revealed.Scientists from the  used satellite tracking to find out how ruddy shelducks 每 which are a similar size to mallards 每 find their way through the mountain range.They do not fly over 8,848-metre Mount Everest but do soar to more than eight times higher than the world＊s tallest structure, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Quite how they manage it remains known. The scientists are still puzzling out how the species is able to cope at such an altitude. The only waterfowl known to have flown higher is the bar-headed goose, which reaches more than 7,000 metres. According to the RSPB, the , which can break the 11,000-metre mark. In the UK, buzzards fly at an average of about 400 metres but can soar to more than 1,000 metres. The efforts of the modest ruddy shelduck are of a higher order. They are known to breed north of the Himalayan mountain range, but spend their winters at sea level south of the Tibetan plateau.They need to fly over the Himalayas in the spring to return to their breeding grounds, meaning they must cross terrain higher than 4,000 metres, where oxygen levels are halved.The University of Exeter scientists used satellite tracking  每 avoiding massive peaks like Everest. But they still reach impressive heights. ※This is the first evidence of extreme high-altitude flight in a duck,§ said the lead researcher, Nicole Parr, from the centre for ecology and conservation at the University of Exeter＊s Penryn campus in Cornwall.※This species has probably evolved a range of adaptations to be able to cope with flying so high, where oxygen levels are half those at sea level. We don＊t yet know the nature of these adaptations. Our research also shows that the ruddy shelduck has a faster climb rate than the bar-headed goose.§Lucy Hawkes, the supervisor of the work at the university, had previously tracked bar-headed geese to an altitude of 7,290 metres near Everest in 2014.The geese were long thought to be the world＊s highest-flying bird based on flapping flight (others soar higher on thermals), but the new research suggests they may not be the only species flying at very high altitudes.The scientists used satellite data collected from 15 ruddy shelducks from two populations spending their winter south of the Tibetan plateau.They found the birds, which take a circuitous route to avoid mountain peaks, regularly fly above 5,000 metres and sometimes go as high as 6,800 metres. The ducks flew about 800 miles. As well as the lack of oxygen they faced changes in altitude, variable wind speeds and directions, decreasing air temperature and reduced humidity.It is possible that the ducks studied are not the highest fliers. The researchers suggested that ruddy shelducks wintering further east in India may fly even higher, given the higher terrain that lies north of India.The ruddy shelduck＊s breeding range stretches from south-eastern Europe to western China, with some established populations in Africa. Its habitat includes fresh water, salty or brackish lakes."																																																			
"he stench of death, the buzz of flies, the indecent exposure 每 it was a stinkhorn. Rude, erect and smothered in bluebottles, the fungus was at the side of the path to the follies at Hawkstone Park, though bank holiday visitors paid it little attention.In the 18th century, when this landscape theme park was created, Linnaeus named the fungus , literally ※shameless phallus§. I imagine visitors then would have been familiar with what the  called the ※prike mushroom＊ in 1597; other folk names included deadman＊s cock. Gwen Raverat, the engraver and granddaughter of  (in her 1952 memoir, ), told a story about her Aunt Hetty (Darwin＊s daughter) collecting stinkhorns from the woods and burning them in secret. This was reportedly to protect the morals of the maids but, given Hetty＊s neopagan interests, perhaps it was something more fun. The stinkhorn is saprobic, feeding on dead tree stumps, and its stink, which contains dimethyl trisulfidethe chemical that is given off by necrotic lesions 每 makes the smell of carrion irresistible to blowflies. Shiny, metallic blue, green or black, the flies cluster on the gooey green gleba 每 the spore-bearing gel that covers the cap of the fungus and is liquefied by the vibrations of the fly＊s proboscis. The fly is attracted to the stinkhorn by the smell but, instead of rotting flesh to lay its eggs in, finds a sugary liquid and gorges on that instead, ingesting the fungal spores suspended in it. The fly benefits from proteins in the gleba that help develop its eggs. The fungus benefits from the fly carrying its spores away and depositing them in faeces. The spores are unaffected by passing through the fly.Stinkhorns are also more numerous around badger setts, attracting flies that will lay their eggs on dead animals; this disposes of them quickly, reducing the risk to the badger colony from disease. In warm weather (for a macabre example) fly maggots can consume 60% of a human body in less than a week. Sex, death and dirty jokes: unmanaged, irreverent, obscene, stinkhorns infiltrate a landscape made for refined pleasures."																																																			
"or three years now, Somaliland, like much of East Africa, has experienced extreme drought. Drought that has become more and more severe, until earlier this year, with thousands on the brink of starvation, the government of  declared a national emergency.The crisis should serve as a warning to the rest of the world to prepare 每 and prepare well 每 for extreme weather events, which are occurring with greater frequency and ferocity than ever before. As the drought ravages the communities of Somaliland and its neighbours, hurricane Irma is making its destructive path through the Caribbean islands towards Florida. Countries in South Asia have been battling floods . Hurricane Harvey has wreaked havoc on the United States＊ Gulf of Mexico. Sierra Leone has scrambled to respond to the deadly impacts of a landslide that took nearly 500 lives.Needless to say, the impacts of these events are wide reaching. They extend beyond the obvious food, water and shelter shortages to the inevitable knock-on effects, such as mass migration within and across country borders, and the aggravation of pre-existing inequalities.I＊ve recently spent two weeks in the small, self-declared independent state in the northwest of Somalia, meeting women leading the humanitarian response to the disaster in their villages. Just hours outside Hargeisa, Somaliland＊s tiny capital, I met women in drought-ravaged communities who have taken up leadership roles for the first time in their lives. These women are desperate to protect the lives of those most at risk in the ongoing crisis. The impact of the drought on Somaliland＊s communities has been extreme. The first two years were increasingly difficult, the women told me, but this last year has been the worst. After years of coping with dwindling water supplies 每 supplies required for business, for food preparation, for sanitation 每 it eventually evaporated almost entirely. Money ran out, animals died. With little to eat, whole communities became malnourished.In Somaliland, those who were marginalised before the drought have experienced its greatest effects. In Saylabari, women have formed a collective to ensure that those most in need are the first to receive assistance when aid is distributed in their village. And who are most affected? Women, they tell me. Women, who have long borne the brunt of a patriarchal system, and its brutish brother, poverty. Singularly responsible for the care of their children, the stress that mothers have experienced in the drought has been severe. High rates of illiteracy among women who have been denied education means less access to information about what relief is on its way and who will have access to it. Levels of domestic violence have increased significantly. Women whose husbands have left in search of alternative income are now responsible for providing for their families, as well as caring for them. Forced to forage for water in far off places, women are often raped on their journeys. For those who migrate, the stories are worse. Over the past six months, people have left their homes in great numbers to search for water and for places their animals can graze on healthy vegetation. Leaving is a gamble 每people leave in the hope that there is more sustenance further afield, but without any guarantee of finding it. Somaliland＊s experience of disaster is typical of any emergency insofar as it disproportionately affects women and those marginalised before the crisis. This is a well-recognised truth that should teach us an important lesson. The only way to prepare adequately for disasters of this scale is to address the deeply entrenched gender inequalities in access to resources and decision making. One hundred kilometres from Saylabari and its women＊s collective, a burgeoning women＊s coalition have waged their own humanitarian response to the crisis in the village of Gorgeysa. Their own community is unaffected by the drought, but the women＊s coalition introduced a policy that every family in the community must take in two families. Chairwoman Ruun Essa Habane said, ※We were receiving so many migrants 每 so many people who were searching for safety and for food and water. We had to work out how we could care for them.§ The collective pooled its resources, resources that the women had been saving over the three years that they have been working together. They used them to provide for those in their care. They donated clothes. When I expressed my stunned (Australian) admiration, Essa Habane seemed surprised. ※What else could we do?§ she said. ※We have the money.§ ※The community cannot make decisions without us,§ said Essa Habane. ※We decided we wanted to support those affected by the drought and that was it.§ There is much that Australia could learn from the women of Somaliland and their response to the country＊s protracted disaster. While the women in communities in Somaliland give up the little they have to support those who lack their basic needs, Australia struggles to respond humanely to the asylum seeker crisis that we have created. Rather than responding with kindness to our fellow human beings, our politicians wallow in arguments about space and resources, postulating threats of terrorism and disseminating notions of greedy people jumping queues to grab ※our§ resources. It＊s worth considering how we might respond if our leadership wouldn＊t primarily consist of white advantaged men, who struggle to see beyond the privilege that has always defined their lives, to empathise with those on the margins. How long can Australia get away with this cruel and selfish response to those in need?  is taking its toll 每 and it＊s a toll that will eventually catch us up.Extreme weather events are already leading to forced migration, in Somaliland and well beyond it, and in the years to come, millions of people will be on the move, in desperate search of food and water. If we are to respond effectively to these impending crises 每 if we are, like the women of Gorgeysa and Saylabari, to ensure that nobody goes without, especially those most vulnerable 每 we must take action now to ensure that women are equally represented in leadership positions, and that they have the support to maintain them. Female leaders create space for other women to take up leadership roles and to participate fully in decision making. They consistently make decisions that benefit whole communities, and ensure that everybody is considered and cared for.  At the end of every conversation I had with different women in Somaliland, they would ask me the same question: ※What are things like for women in your country? What advice do you have for us as we strive for greater things 每 for presidency?§ All I could tell them was that in Australia, we＊ve taken great steps forward but that the road ahead is long. I said that  could learn from . That by supporting women＊s leadership, perhaps we too, some day, might say, ※What else could we do? We have the money.§ "																																																			
																																																			
"Delicate mosses found on rocks and trees in cities around the world can be used to measure the impact of atmospheric change and could prove a low-cost way to monitor , according to Japanese scientists.Moss, a ※bioindicator§, responds to pollution or drought-stress by changing shape, density or by disappearing, allowing scientists to calculate atmospheric alterations, said Yoshitaka Oishi, associate professor at Fukui Prefectural University. He said: ※This method is very cost effective and important for getting information about atmospheric conditions.※Mosses are a common plant in all cities so we can use this method in many countries ... they have a big potential to be bioindicators,§ said Oishi, who analysed nearly 50 types of moss for the study.Oishi said humid cities where moss thrives could benefit most from using bryophytes 每 a collective term for mosses, hornworts and liverworts 每 as bioindicators, adding moss could be monitored in its natural environment or cultivated for analysis. In a research paper published in the Landscape and Urban Planning journal, Oishi and a colleague described how they studied the effect of nitrogen pollution, air quality and drought-stress on moss found over a 1.9 sq mile (3 sq km) area in Hachioji City in north-west Tokyo. The study showed severe drought-stress tended to occur in areas with high levels of nitrogen pollution, which it said raised concerns over the impact on health and biodiversity.However, the scientists could not effectively measure air purity which affects the number of moss types as pollution levels in the sample area were not high enough, said Oishi. ※If the air pollution is severe, the purity is also evaluated by moss ... the change of the moss is very diverse according to the environmental problem.§Bioindicators such as mosses, which generally absorb water and nutrients from their immediate environments, were often cheaper to use than other methods of environmental evaluation and can also reflect changes to ecosystems, said the scientists. The World Health Organisation says 88% of city dwellers are exposed to annual pollution levels that exceed its air quality guidelines. South-east Asia and the eastern Mediterranean have the worst air quality, followed by countries in Latin America and Africa. ※We believe this method can contribute to the evaluation of atmospheric pollution in other areas,§ said Oishi.

" reefs have almost always been studied up close, by scientists in the water looking at small portions of larger reefs to gather data and knowledge about the larger ecosystems. But Nasa＊s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is taking a step back and getting a wider view, from about 23,000 ft above.Nasa and top scientists from around the world are launching  like never before.Using specially-designed instruments mounted on high-flying aircraft, the scientists plan to map large swaths of coral around the world in hopes of better understanding how .The researchers hope to discover how environmental forces including global warming, acidification and pollution impact coral reefs in different locations by creating detailed images of entire reef ecosystems.※CORAL (Coral Reef Airborne Laboratory) is an airborne mission to survey reefs at select locations across the Pacific,§ Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences＊ Eric Hochberg, who is principal investigator for the project, told the Associated Press.※The idea is to get a new perspective on coral reefs from above, to study them at a larger scale than we have been able to before, and then relate reef condition to the environment.§ Hochberg and the project＊s lead  scientist Michelle Gierach were in Oahu, Hawaii＊s Kaneohe Bay to gather baseline data in the water.While the primary science will be conducted using instruments that map the sea floor from above, the team must also take baseline measurements in the ocean to validate the data they get from the air, Gierach said. Her main role in the project is to decipher the data gathered from the aircraft.※PRISM, the instrument that we＊re using ... is the state-of-the-art instrument for addressing coastal and in-water science questions,§ Gierach said. ※CORAL wouldn＊t be possible without an instrument like PRISM, it＊s really the heart and soul of the project.§Coral reefs drive many tourist economies around the world, but they provide much more than pretty places to dive and snorkel, Gierach said. Reefs are critical habitat for the majority of the fish humans consume and also protect shorelines from dangerous storm surges and rising ocean levels.Recently scientists have developed pharmaceutical applications from coral reefs, including pain killers that aren＊t habit forming, Hochberg said.※Just realizing that though you may not see a coral, that you may not have your backyard be within this beautiful environment that we＊re in right now, corals are impacting you, they are globally important,§ Gierach said. ※We have to understand how they＊re changing so we can make some managed decisions about their future.§Reefs are among the first ecosystems to be dramatically and directly impacted by global warming, according to the researchers.The , published in 2015, said that over the past few decades, up to 50% of coral reefs have been ※largely or completely degraded by a combination of local factors and global climate change.§Julia Baum, assistant professor of biology at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, has done extensive research on coral reefs and said that the data gathered from this kind of project could prove highly valuable for international reef scientists and the conservation community.※I＊m a huge proponent of open source data,§ Baum said. ※To me, the application of this technology to coral reefs holds great promise, but to fulfill that promise the data has to be made openly available to the scientific community.§ The CORAL researchers said all data will be publicly available and will take about six months to process once captured.Baum acknowledged that a lot of coral reef science has been limited by the lack of broad data sets like this project plans to provide.※As scientific divers we＊re limited by the depth we can work at and the amount of bottom time that we have while we＊re diving, so much of underwater marine science, especially on coral reefs is a painstakingly slow process,§ Baum said. ※This Coral Reef Airborne Laboratory can＊t replace scientists in the water, but it can provide a very high-level, complementary type of data.§The CORAL team will study the reefs of Hawaii, Palau, the Mariana Islands, and Australia＊s Great Barrier Reef over the next three years."																																																			
"The South African government has  after the hight court ruled against its plans for a coal-fired power station, the latest in a rising tide of international climate litigation.Environmental NGO  challenged the government＊s approval of the proposed Thabametsi coal-fired power station on the grounds that it should have been preceded by an evaluation of its climate change impacts.  and ordered the government to reconsider its approval, taking into account a full climate change impact assessment.A draft assessment shows that the project slated for the drought-prone Limpopo province will produce significant greenhouse gas emissions, and that the climate impacts threaten the future viability of the plant. The case comes shortly after a  decided last month in Austria. A federal court blocked the expansion of Vienna＊s international airport because the increase in carbon emissions that a new runway would generate is inconsistent with Austria＊s commitments to tackle climate change. The Austrian decision not only echoes controversies around airport expansions in the UK and France; it＊s also the latest example of courts around the world stepping in to hold governments to account for escalating global temperatures.Since a landmark , filed by my colleagues, resulted in an order that the government significantly reduce its carbon emissions, lawsuits challenging inaction on climate change have been filed in courtrooms in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Some lawsuits target the inadequacy of policies intended to reduce carbon emissions (as in the , ,  and ) while others challenge individual projects that have potentially catastrophic consequences for the climate (as in , where the government has permitted new drilling for oil in the Arctic). In , where rising temperatures are already threatening lives and livelihoods, a court found in favour of a farmer who argued that his rights to life and dignity were under threat because of the government＊s inadequate climate change policy.Climate change litigation is an invaluable strategy at a time when governments have failed to live up to their repeated promises, affirmed most recently in the Paris agreement, to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. Current pledges to reduce emissions are  to warming of 3.2C above pre-industrial levels 每 way above the agreed target of ※well below 2C§ and likely to lead to radical changes in the environment.Aside from highlighting the obligations of governments to protect their citizens from foreseeable harm, these cases have the considerable advantage of putting the facts of climate change on the public record. These facts, endorsed by governments through the , include that climate change is real; that it is caused by human activity; that it will dramatically affect every region in the world; and that it is more cost-effective to act now than later. While it might be expedient for politicians to obfuscate these facts, it is another matter altogether to produce evidence to substantiate their position in court.The political and social ripple effects of climate change cases are also enormous. While the Dutch government is appealing against the court＊s ruling in the Netherlands, the case has already had a huge impact on national policy making and public debate. Emboldened by the ruling, opposition MPs have drafted a new, more ambitious climate change act and a majority of parliamentarians have voted to  as quickly as possible. It has also catalysed an unprecedented level of social mobilisation around climate change as an issue.These cases are powerful vehicles for the progressive action on climate that is urgently needed. Far from being an undue interference with policy making processes, courts are reaching decisions in accordance with existing law and science. For as long as governments fail to take the steps necessary to avert dangerous change, courts can be expected to act as vital checks on political inaction."																																																			
"Australia＊s financial institutions could be required to test climate-risk scenarios as international regulators continue to warn of the economic dangers posed by climate change.Geoff Summerhayes, executive board member of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), told a Senate committee that climate scenario testing could be added to the other common scenarios Apra requires financial institutions to face to ensure their systems are robust. It＊s been more than a year since the COP21 Paris climate change conference, when the former New York City mayor to head a taskforce to provide investors, insurers, banks and consumers with more information. The move was part of plans for a voluntary industry-led code announced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the G20 body that monitors and makes recommendations about the financial system.Last month  climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Apra is the regulator that oversees the $6tn industry made up of banks, building societies, superannuation, insurance companies and other financial institutions. Summerhayes said Apra already sent out common scenarios for institutions to test. These scenarios have an economic factor, including an asset price shock and, in the case of the insurance industry, a potential liabilities scenario as well.※It is possible in the future that climate could be such a risk that we would want to test,§ Summerhayes said. ※That is not in our current plans but it is possible as other emerging risks are, that we would scenario test.§He acknowledged the Bank of England＊s Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) had been very active on climate change. The bank＊s governor,  of financial crises and falling living standards unless corporations faced up to the risks. ※Apra is not first prudential regulator to make statements about climate,§ he said.Emma Herd, the chief executive of Investor Group on Climate Change, told the committee the political debate in recent years had stopped companies speaking publicly about their strategic response to climate change.※In terms of company reporting, the challenge for companies is that ＃ any statement that is made around climate change as a financial risk is then interpreted through the prism of the political debate,§ Herd said. ※So companies have to be incredibly cautious about statements that they are making and constantly apply that political lens and I think that is creating a level of conservatism that is inhibiting how companies talk about their strategic response to climate change.※Companies are often much more prepared to talk fully and frankly to investors about their view than they are to talk publicly and into the public debate because it is just seen through the prism of the debate of the last 10 years.§Herd revealed unpublished research from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors from 1 March this year, in which an analysis of 167 ASX 200 companies found there were large gaps in corporate reporting. It found:Herd said reports were very short on detail with many companies simply disclosing their emissions. Very few disclosed a strategy for dealing with the climate-related issues that might affect the businesses, or report on mitigating these risks.Summerhayes said his climate warning last month came about due to three factors: , the Bloomberg taskforce and  for the Centre for Policy Development and the Future Business Council on company directors＊ duties and climate change.Last month he said: ※The opinion found that company directors who fail to properly consider and disclose foreseeable climate-related risks to their business could be held personally liable for breaching their statutory duty of due care and diligence under the Corporations Act.§Summerhayes said climate was an active discussion in many of the institutions supervised by Apra. ※Markers that have been put down in the last year are significant and markets are already adjusting to those markers and the extent to which the draft report to FSB is adopted or not, we are of the view that a transition is under way to a lower-carbon world and that has implications on the risks that Apra-regulated entities need to oversee.※Hence we expect them to be having a conversation about it.§Kate O＊Rourke of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the regulatory framework was flexible enough to accommodate scenario testing and companies could choose to dramatically change their information disclosures on climate risks. Last month  that a decade of partisan politics and finger-pointing had destroyed investor confidence in Australia＊s energy sector., initiated by Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson and restarted after the federal election, is looking into carbon risk and disclosure in corporate Australia."																																																			
"Voluntary action by the cosmetics industry to phase out the use of microbeads in  came under strong attack from MPs on Wednesday, who criticised loopholes in the pledges and slammed the lack of labelling on products containing the plastic particles.Tiny plastic beads are widely used in toiletries and cosmetics but thousands of tonnes of them wash into the sea every year, where they harm wildlife and can ultimately be eaten by people. The US has banned microbeads and a  people asking for a ban in the UK was delivered to David Cameron on Wednesday.However, giving evidence to parliament＊s , John Chave, director general of trade body Cosmetics Europe, said: ※We think voluntary action is a good way to address this problem. We think we are a responsible industry and we want to do the right thing.§Zac Goldsmith MP disagreed: ※I am trying to understand why as a trade body would you be so strongly opposed to a ban and I can＊t think of any reason other than the fact that the industry is perhaps not as committed as you imply.§Another MP, Peter Heaton-Jones, said the lack of labelling of products was a serious problem: ※The consumer has no way of knowing whether that box or tube or bottle of stuff that he or she is about to buy contains microbeads or not.§ Chris Flower, director general of the Cosmetics, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, which represents the UK industry, said: ※The practical side of [labelling] may be extremely difficult to implement.§Loopholes in the voluntary pledges made by the cosmetics manufacturers were also raised by MPs, based on evidence submitted by campaigners. These include only committing to stop using plastics beads in ※exfoliating§ products, despite solid plastics being used in items including moisturisers, make-up, lip balms and shaving foams.Many pledges are also unclear about the minimum size of microbeads being excluded, which means small particles used in products like sunscreens and face powders would continue to be used. Some commitments allow the use of ※biodegradable§ plastic microbeads, despite such materials being  to the problem by the chief scientist at the UN Environment Programme, because they do not break down in cool, dark ocean waters. Some of the company pledges also do not commit to phasing out the beads in all countries and in future products.Flower said the concept of biodegradability was ※evolving§. But he said , which has a 2020 deadline, should be given time to work. ※If, on inspection, it is shows we can＊t do that job properly, then we would have no grounds for opposing a legislative ban.§ Earlier on Wednesday it was revealed that major manufacturers had  to the EAC.Daniel Steadman, from Fauna & Flora International, which produces , said the loopholes were unacceptable: ※When the public say they do not want microbeads, they do not expect a technical discussion about what microbeads are, they want products that don＊t cause environmental pollution after they use them. A robust, loophole-free legislative ban is an unequivocal way to achieve this, getting rid of the problems with current commitments and making clear the public gets what the public wants.§ In April, a  backed a microbead ban.On the absence of microbead labelling on products, Steadman said: ※People can＊t track the activities of a remote trade association or trawl 1000s of companies websites for commitments.§The tiny beads are too small to be filtered effectively by sewage treatment plants and flow into the oceans. Plastic pollution in the oceans is a huge problem:  are floating in the world＊s seas. Microbeads, also used in some toothpastes, are a small but significant part of this which campaigners argue is the easiest to prevent.Microbeads are eaten by marine life, which mistake them for food particles, and have been shown to . The tiny beads can also attract toxins from seawater, which are then . The beads are thought to be eaten by people consuming seafood and .

But on 5 May, Rory Stewart indicated for the first time that the government could back a ban."																																																			
"The citizens of four major European countries think the impacts of climate change such as severe floods and storms are already affecting them, according to a major new polling study.The research dispels the idea that global warming is widely seen as a future problem, and also shows strong support for action to tackle global warming, including subsidies for clean energy and big financial penalties for nations that refuse to be part of the international climate deal signed in Paris in 2015 每 as US president . There was also strong support for giving financial aid to developing nations to cope with the impacts of climate change.Renewable energy was viewed very positively in all nations, but fracking had little support, with just 20% of people seeing it positively in the UK, 15% in Germany and 9% in France. Nuclear power was also unpopular: only 23% of those in France, where it supplies the vast majority of electricity, have a favourable opinion.Overwhelming majorities of people in the UK, Germany, France and Norway said climate change was at least partly caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels. But only a third thought the vast majority of scientists agreed with this, despite about  doing so.※It is encouraging to see that most people in this very large study recognise that climate change is happening, and that support for the need to tackle it remains high amongst the people we surveyed,§ said Prof Nick Pidgeon at Cardiff University, who led the international project. He said the firm backing of the public could be important in the light of : ※With the recently shifting political mood in some countries, climate policy is now entering a critical phase. It is therefore even more important that the public＊s clear support for the Paris agreement is carried through by policymakers across Europe and worldwide.§Nick Molho, at the Aldersgate Group, a business alliance that lobbies for a sustainable economy, said: ※The UK government should build on the existing public support for climate policies to put forward in the near future a clear plan to meet the emissions reduction targets.§ The polling study is the first in-depth climate change research in multiple European nations and involved interviewing more than 1,000 people in each country, with the results then weighted to be nationally representative.The citizens gave near identical answers to the question of when the impacts of global warming would be felt, with 60% answering that they were already here. At least two-thirds of them supported their nation being part of the Paris climate deal and they were at least two to one in favour of penalising countries that were not, perhaps via . ※People see that if there are free riders, that is not a very good thing,§ said Pidgeon.

In the UK, people were evenly split over tax hikes for fossil fuels.Another split was in the trust people had in the European commission and national and local governments to transform their nation＊s energy system to cleaner forms of energy.

"ites soar and circle above the small limestone village mentioned in the Domesday book but rebuilt a little over 200 years ago to a design by . There is a substantial  roost near the village, and 40 of them bring the sky to life with their twists and turns, tails contorting and long wings clawing the air.Surely there is no other prodigal English species that brings such pleasure. In Repton＊s time the villagers may have watched red kites over , but by 1871 widespread gamekeeping had eliminated the bird in England.

One section of runway is now a small airfield from which throaty-engined little planes take to the air. Much of the base has been reclaimed by agriculture, but some concrete roadways remain, enveloped in scrub. Most interestingly, the central area has been excavated for iron stone and is a thinly soiled, scrubby, rough grassland. It looks good for a summer visit, but is rather quiet on this cool, grey day. There are no frogs out in the two large shallow pools; however, under a large chunk of asphalt we find more than a dozen .

"In the latest attempt from a big city , Barcelona has ambitious plans. Currently faced with excessive pollution and noise levels, the city has come up with  to reduce traffic by 21%. And it comes with something extra: freeing up nearly 60% of streets currently used by cars to turn them into so-called ※citizen spaces§. The plan is based around the idea of  (superblocks) 每 mini neighbourhoods around which traffic will flow, and in which spaces will be repurposed to ※fill our city with life§, as its tagline says.This plan will start in the famous gridded neighbourhood of Eixample. That revolutionary design, , had at its core the idea that the city should breathe and 每 for both ideological and public health reasons 每 planned for the population to be spread out equally, as well as providing green spaces within each block. Reality and urban development have, however, got the best of it, and as the grid lines became choked with cars, the city＊s pollution and noise levels have skyrocketed. What was once a design to make Barcelona healthier, now has to be dramatically rethought for the same reasons.According to several studies, air pollution alone causes  in Barcelona＊s metropolitan area (with a population of 3.2 million), as well as having severe effects on local ecosystems and agriculture. Barcelona and the 35 municipalities in its surrounding area have persistently failed to meet EU-established air quality targets.  determined that 1,200 deaths could be prevented in the city yearly just by reaching EU-mandated levels for nitrogen dioxide levels (this would mean a five-month rise in life expectancy). Add to that an estimated 18,700 fewer asthma attacks, 12,100 fewer cases of acute bronchitis and 600 fewer cardiovascular-related hospitalisations, and the problem becomes apparent for a city with a population of 1.6 million. Traffic is also the first cause for noise pollution in the city; 61% of its residents live with noise levels higher than those deemed healthy by legislation.The council also cites road accidents (), sedentary lifestyles (one in five kids in Barcelona are overweight or at risk of reaching that state), and the lack of green spaces as reasons driving the plan. The city has only 6.6 sq metres of green space per inhabitant (with the figures standing at just 1.85 in Eixample and 3.15 in Gr角cia), closer to Tokyo＊s three than to London＊s 27, or Amsterdam＊s staggering 87.5. The World Health Organisation suggests every city should have at least 9 sq metres per capita.Barcelona＊s new plan consists of creating big  through a series of gradual interventions that will repurpose existing infrastructure, starting with traffic management through to changing road signs and bus routes. Superblocks will be smaller than neighbourhoods, but bigger than actual blocks. This will first be applied to  and others like Sant Mart赤, which largely follows the same grid pattern. In Eixample, a superblock will consist of nine existing blocks of the grid. Car, scooter, lorry and bus traffic will then be restricted to just the roads in the superblock perimeters, and they will only be allowed in the streets in between if they are residents or providing local businesses, and at a greatly reduced speed of 10km/h (typically the speed limit across the city is 50km/h, and 30km/h in specific areas).The objectives are ambitious; by implementing these strategies at once, the city wants to reduce car use by 21% over the next two years and increase mobility by foot, bike and public transport. Superblocks will be complemented by the introduction of 300km of new cycling lanes (there are currently around 100km), as well as an orthogonal bus network that has already been put in place, whereby buses only navigate a series of main thoroughfares. This will ensure, says Salvador Rueda, director of the city＊s urban ecology agency and one of the drivers of the superblocks idea, that ※anyone will be less than 300 metres from a bus stop at any time 每 and average waiting times will be of five minutes anywhere in the city [current averages stand at 14]§. In addition, ※it would be an equitable network in which one could go from any point A to point B with just one transfer in 95% of the cases. Like in a game of Battleship§.※It＊s no surprise that this concept was born here,§ said mobility city councillor Mercedes Vidal in the public presentation of the plan this month. ※In a city as dense as ours, it＊s all the more necessary to re-conquer spaces.§ If all goes as planned, around seven of the 13.8 million sq metres now dedicated to motorised traffic will be freed up.Private vehicles account for just 20% of total movements in the city today and yet they occupy 60% of roads. ※We need to win the street back,§ says Janet Sanz, city councillor for ecology, urbanism and mobility, who emphasised the need to encourage social cohesion, coexistence and human exchanges. Recently,  the spirit of  on the 100th anniversary of the writer and urbanist＊s birth: ※She proposed giving the street back to the neighbours. Today we work for that objective.§※This plan sums up the essence of urban ecology,§ Sanz adds. ※Our objective is for Barcelona to be a city in which to live. Also, as a Mediterranean city, its residents spend a long time on the streets 每 those streets need to be second homes, or extensions of one＊s residence, at all times ＃ Public spaces need to be spaces to play, where green is not an anecdote 每 where the neighbourhood＊s history and local life have a presence.§※We want these public spaces to be areas where one can exercise all citizen rights: exchange, expression and participation, culture and knowledge, the right to leisure,§ Rueda says.The entire process is being conducted in nine areas at a different pace, through what Sanz called ※tactical urbanism§ 每 a gradual trial and error method of sorts, with initial measures such as changing road signs 每 and with an initial budget of 10m (?7.9m). Now it is time to ※go from theory to action§, she says.The superblocks idea was first outlined in 1987, after noise mapping revealed that levels were too high, and the first superblock was tested in 2003 in Gr角cia. Many experiments, like car-free days, have also been conducted in districts like Sant Mart赤, which will act as the main guinea pig for superblocks. Its city councillor, Josep Maria Montaner, says it has been done in close consultation with groups of neighbours ※and it will continue to be so. Neighbours need to experiment it and try the new spaces, little by little 每 and we hope many of the ideas for how to use them will come from them§.Rueda says superblocks go back to Cerd角＊s philosophy and take it to the next level, to the modern world, by making it live with and for the ecosystem. ※We have, as a base [for the plan], Cerd角＊s Eixample, which was undermined by greed. What was green in the plan was slowly overtaken and built on. And then, when cars arrived, they slowly overtook more and more space ... We want to reclaim those green spaces and that can only be done through a drastic mobility change.§An Eixample superblock of about 400 x 400 metres, Rueda says, would be inhabited by between 5,000 and 6,000 people. That is ※the same as many small towns. Everything we need to consider to face the challenges of this turn of a century 每 construction, economy, water, residues, metabolisms, social cohesion 每 should be captured in these superblocks.§※Every superblock is like a small city with its own character,§ the plan suggests. ※Imagine what could be done. An Eixample intersection is as big as a Gr角cia square,§ says Rueda, and he highlights that this new city structure will free up 160 intersections. ※I＊m already fantasising with neighbourhood-organised inflatable swimming pools in the summer,§ he jokes."																																																			
"Clouds of butterflies have been sighted in southern Britain this summer but wildlife lovers are being urged to help scientifically assess whether our insects are  by joining the world＊s largest butterfly survey.The  begins on Friday with reports of an unusually good year for butterflies but ecologists warn this could be a mistaken perception, and 2017 is simply a modest improvement on last summer 每 the .※We find that what looks like a good year nowadays is only an average year back in the 1980s,§ warned Richard Fox of , which runs the annual survey.

These species usually emerge to feed on garden flowers before their winter hibernation.For participants in the Big Butterfly Count 每 where people take 15 minutes to count butterflies in their local park, woodland or garden 每 the sightings offer hope that they will count more than in 2016, which was the .Scientists hope the data gathered will help solve riddles such as the mysterious decline of the once-common .

"The greatest impact individuals can have in fighting climate change is to have one fewer child, according to a new study that identifies the most effective ways people can cut their carbon emissions.The next best actions are selling your car, avoiding long flights, and eating a vegetarian diet. These reduce emissions many times more than common green activities, such as recycling, using low energy light bulbs or drying washing on a line. However, the high impact actions are rarely mentioned in government advice and school textbooks, researchers found.Carbon emissions must fall to two tonnes of CO2 per person by 2050 to avoid severe global warming, but in the  and in the UK seven tonnes. ※That＊s obviously a really big change and we wanted to show that individuals have an opportunity to be a part of that,§ said Kimberly Nicholas, at Lund University in Sweden and one of the research team.The new study, , sets out the impact of different actions on a comparable basis. By far the biggest ultimate impact is having one fewer child, which the researchers calculated equated to a reduction of 58 tonnes of CO2 for each year of a parent＊s life.The  by totting up the emissions of the child and all their descendants, then dividing this total by the parent＊s lifespan. Each parent was ascribed 50% of the child＊s emissions, 25% of their grandchildren＊s emissions and so on.※We recognise these are deeply personal choices. But we can＊t ignore the climate effect our lifestyle actually has,§ said Nicholas. ※It is our job as scientists to honestly report the data. Like a doctor who sees the patient is in poor health and might not like the message ＆smoking is bad for you＊, we are forced to confront the fact that current emission levels are really bad for the planet and human society.§※In life, there are many values on which people make decisions and carbon is only one of them,§ she added. ※I don＊t have children, but it is a choice I am considering and discussing with my fiance. Because we care so much about climate change that will certainly be one factor we consider in the decision, but it won＊t be the only one.§Overpopulation has been a controversial factor in the climate change debate, with some pointing out that an American is responsible for 40 times the emissions produced by a Bangladeshi and that overconsumption is the crucial issue. The new research comes a day after researchers blamed overpopulation and overconsumption on the  which has started a mass extinction of species on the planet.Nicholas said that many of the choices had positive effects as well, such as a healthier diet, as meat consumption in developed countries is about five times higher than recommended by health authorities. Cleaner transport also cuts air pollution, and walking and cycling can reduce obesity. ※It is not a sacrifice message,§ she said. ※It is trying to find ways to live a good life in a way that leaves a good atmosphere for the planet. I＊ve found it really positive to make many of these changes.§The researchers analysed dozens of sources from Europe, North America and Japan to calculate the carbon savings individuals in richer nations can make. They found getting rid of a car saved 2.4 tonnes a year, avoiding a return transatlantic flight saved 1.6 tonnes and becoming vegetarian saved 0.8 tonnes a year.These actions saved the same carbon whichever country an individual lived in, but others varied. The savings from switching to an electric car depend on how green electricity generation is, meaning big savings can be made in Australia but the savings in Belgium are six times lower. Switching your home energy supplier to a green energy company also varied, depending on whether the green energy displaces fossil fuel energy or not.Nicholas said the low-impact actions, such as recycling, were still worth doing: ※All of those are good things to do. But they are more of a beginning than an end. They are certainly not sufficient to tackle the scale of the climate challenge that we face.§The researchers found that government advice in the US, Canada, EU and Australia rarely mentioned the high impact actions, with only the EU citing eating less meat and only Australia citing living without a car. None mentioned having one fewer child. In an analysis of school textbooks on Canada only 4% of the recommendations were high impact.Chris Goodall, an author on low carbon living and energy, said: ※The paper usefully reminds us what matters in the fight against global warming. But in some ways it will just reinforce the suspicion of the political right that the threat of climate change is simply a cover for reducing people＊s freedom to live as they want.※Population reduction would probably reduce carbon emissions but we have many other tools for getting global warming under control,§ he said. ※Perhaps more importantly, cutting the number of people on the planet will take hundreds of years. Emissions reduction needs to start now.§"																																																			
																																																			
"The Australian car industry has tried to kill any government move to cut greenhouse gas emissions from cars, arguing it would increase the cost to consumers and contradicting comprehensive government modelling.The government plans to introduce emissions standards for new cars, releasing a series of proposed targets in  and seeking input from industry and other stakeholders.Under the strongest target considered, new cars would have to cut their CO2 emissions by 45% below current levels by 2025 每 from 192g of CO2 a kilometre to 105g. by the government＊s Climate Change Authority found the change would save consumers thousands of dollars.

Then there was another incident in which . ※Thirty-three were pregnant. They were wiping out entire herds. There were reports in other poaching cases that the bullets came down from above, so that meant there were helicopters involved. It was a nightmare.§Chandra had a similarly emotional awakening in 2013, when  in Kenya＊s Tsavo National Park. ※It lit a fire in me,§ she recalls. ※The barbarism of the act was so horrifying that I could not sit back and stay quiet.§In 2013 the first International March For Elephants and Rhinos was organised by the  and . It sparked the creation of dozens of local groups, and a network to co-ordinate them internationally. Off the back of this the  was founded in 2014 by Rosemary Alles, Denise Dresner and Maria Mossman as a grassroots movement, which took over the reins of organising subsequent marches. Last year, they brought together demonstrators in 140 locations in 40 countries. Mossman describes the annual marches as ※really powerful and really emotional§. In 2015, some poachers in Uganda were reportedly moved to hand in their spears afterwards.It was at the marches that Mossman and Green met the women who now help them to organise events, write letters, raise funds, liaise with the media and create posters, literature and websites. For both women, their core teams are 100% female.It was the connections made at the 2013 march that led to one of the notable victories in elephant conservation: reducing the demand for ivory from China. The combined forces of grassroots activists, NGO campaigns such as the ＊s  campaign, and Prince William＊s with  put pressure on China to end its ivory trade. But China＊s decision was at least partly prompted by a series of protests outside its embassies. ※At the end of [the 2013 march] I was talking to all the people there and everybody was saying that they wanted to be able to go to the Chinese embassy,§ Mossman recalls. ※There were so many passionate people.§ She created AFEUK, together with Denise Dresner, who edits the organisation＊s letters; Joanne Smith, who takes care of networking; and Maria Ibrahim, who does the team＊s graphics. Their first act was to demonstrate outside the Chinese embassy in London. ※We were six weeks old and we were novices, and not really sure what we were doing,§ Mossman says.

It has even reached young boys from the Nairobi slum of Kibera, who joined the 2016 protests outside the Chinese Embassy. Bringing together the political and traditional aspects of Kenyan society, KUAPO has also convinced the  (KWS) to meet community elders to , after which the two groups gave joint talks on conservation ethics and the new wildlife law.※For aeons KWS and Njavungo [Council of Elders] had not sat down in the same room,§ Chandra says. ※KWS had felt there was no role for elders in conservation management and the elders had felt ostracised by KWS and the laws of the country that forbade them from going into protected areas where their shrines were, for example.§Val Green, meanwhile, has been pouring her energies into , a crowd-sourced project whose members report suspicious-looking listings on auction websites that have policies banning the sale of ivory. The concept was roadtested in January by members of the Scotland for Elephants and Rhinos group, with encouraging results.Over the course of two days, Green and her colleagues searched auction sites and reported 57 items that they strongly suspected of being ivory to sites including eBay, Preloved, Gumtree and Etsy. Of these, 19 items 每 with a combined value of ?10,569 每 were immediately taken down. Most auction sites have strict rules about ivory. , does not allow bones from elephants, walruses and whales; carved and uncarved ivory; fossilised ivory or mammoth tusks; or manufactured items with 5% or more ivory.According to Green, suspicious items can be identified by searching for terms such as ※bovine bone§, ※deeply carved Chinese antique§, ※faux-ivory§, ※cow bone§ and ※ivory-coloured§, and then sorting by the highest prices. In some cases, photos will make it clear that the rules are being breached; in others sellers will privately confirm that they are selling ivory.Campaigners have also been targeting other materials derived from endangered species, such as rhino horn, tortoiseshell and leopard fur. §It＊s not just the elephant items that are so upsetting,§ says a US-based activist who asks to be identified only as Trudy. ※It＊s the vintage ocelot coats, the rhino taxidermy head, it＊s the lamp with four rhino feet used as its base, it＊s the river otter coats, the skins from the coyote heads that ＆can be used as a fun mask on Halloween＊, on and on and on.§ In her opinion, very few people uploading items to online auctions have the ※age authentication documentation§ required to prove that the goods are antiques and therefore exempt from strict anti-trafficking laws. And auction sites rarely ask to see it. ※The sellers are counting on this,§ she says.But Trudy, like other activists, is aware that it＊s not healthy or sustainable to spend all of her spare time advocating for wildlife. ※I am one person,§ she says. ※I have one computer. I have an eye condition that precludes me from spending extended amounts of time on said computer.§And Chandra? ※I always make sure that I have one hour in the morning to myself,§ she says. ※Normally it＊s when I walk Misty 每 my labrador retriever 每 in the forest and gather my thoughts for the day.§ Ultimately, no matter how passionate the activists are, they need to take care of themselves if they are to continue to be a voice for the elephants.

"Dangerous levels of air pollution in towns and cities across the north of England are threatening the health of hundreds of thousands of people and stifling economic growth, according to a new report.The analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) North describes air pollution as ※the tobacco of the 21st century§ and says that while there has been a growing concern about the problem in London, many residents in regional towns and cities are unaware of the threat to their health.Darren Baxter, researcher at IPPR North, said it was time the government took radical action.※Too often the attention focuses on unclean air in the capital, but the reality is that it＊s poisoning thousands in our regional cities too,§ said Baxter. ※Michael Gove [the new environment secretary] must show that the government is not prepared to sit on its hands while . We need to see radical plans to ditch diesel, introduce incentives for electric cars and bring in clean air zones in our major cities.§The government has  over its plans to improve air quality in the UK after judges ruled they were so poor as to be unlawful.

And the Cascade-Siskiyou preserve is on the list.※All the signs indicate that we＊re in the crosshairs,§ says Willis, as his horses drift through 10-storey trees during a recent ride through the monument. ※We could lose it all.§With the monument review due to the president on Thursday, conservationists like Willis are on edge. , the swaggeringMontana native who is the secretary of the interior and is leading the effort, has already unveiled some of his recommendations. They include shrinking the Bears Ears national monument in Utah, a 1.3 million-acre monument created by Obama to protect Native American antiquities. Zinke said six monuments should be left alone, which leaves 20 including the Cascade-Siskiyou at risk of being reduced in size, eliminated or opened to industrial uses.In late July, Zinke, visited Cascade-Siskiyou; he met with monument opponents and supporters. He hasn＊t yet publicly signaled the direction he is leaning in. But since his arrival in Washington, Zinke has been remaking the interior department by filling senior positions with representatives from extractive industries and rightwing advocacy groups. At its core, the monument review is an attempt to weaken the Antiquities Act, one of America＊s oldest public-interest conservation laws. Backing the review are some of the most powerful conservative factions in Washington, including organizations such as the Heritage Foundation, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Americans for Prosperity, all heavily financed by dark-money funds tied to wealthy Republican donors. The debate over Cascade-Siskiyou presents a snapshot of the cultural and economic conflict that so often characterizes public land management in the American west. It＊s a conflict that regularly pits scientists, conservationists and the burgeoning outdoor-recreation economy against the industrial interests that have dominated the region for well over a century. The struggle is about power and wealth and culture 每 who gets to decide how the publicly owned mountains and mineral deposits and timberlands are managed.※The underlying issue, across the west§, says Steve Pedery, the conservation director at Oregon Wild, ※is that oil, gas, mining, grazing and logging interests are angry because 20 years ago they ruled public lands, and today they don＊t.§ Under the Antiquities Act of 1906, the president is authorized to unilaterally declare any federally owned object ※of historic or scientific interest§ a national monument and preserve it in perpetuity for all Americans. Every president since Theodore Roosevelt, save Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H W Bush, has used it, and this country now has a grand total of 129 such monuments. The 27 monuments now under review were set aside over the past three decades by Clinton, George W Bush and Obama.  is the first president to consider undoing the designation of monuments by his predecessors.In 2000, when Clinton initially established the Cascade-Siskiyou monument, he described it as a ※biological crossroads 每 the interface of the Cascade, Klamath and Siskiyou eco-regions, in an area of unique geology, biology, climate and topography§. The monument＊s extraordinary species diversity includes a vast selection of birds and furbearers, of wildflowers and ferns and fungi, much of it undisturbed by industrial activity or real estate development.In 2011, however, local scientists came together and concluded that the monument did not sufficiently protect the full range of species diversity in the landscape. They published a report that urged the Obama administration to expand it and began a campaign to make the Cascade-Siskiyou monument bigger.The Soda Mountain Wilderness Council, chaired by Dave Willis, along with a slew of other environmental groups, led the charge. They did the slow grassroots work that conservation work often requires, from lobbying federal representatives to taking people into the backcountry to see the landscape for themselves. Oregon＊s governor, both its senators and numerous state legislators backed the expansion. The nearby Klamath Tribes were behind it, too.In mid-January, they largely prevailed when Obama agreed to expand the monument.But the opposition was significant. The expansion would permanently withdraw as much as 45,000 acres of land from most commercial timber production though many of these had already been set aside for conservation purposes. Greg Walden, the state＊s powerful Republican congressman opposed the expansion. The governments of all three counties containing the monument, as well as seven Oregon state legislators and two California members of Congress, also were against it. The most vigorous foes, though, were members of the timber industry.※The economic impacts [of the monument expansion] would be devastating,§ says Travis Joseph, president of the Portland-based American Forest Resource Council, or AFRC, a timber industry trade group. Joseph says neighboring counties would forever lose revenue for public safety, health and roads, asserting that those acres could support or create a few hundred jobs.In March, the AFRC filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing that Obama＊s national monument expansion wasn＊t just economically harmful but also fundamentally illegal. The suit relies on a little known law called the the Oregon and California Revested Lands Sustained Yield Management Act (known as the O&C Act) of 1937. The law declares that these lands are to be managed for ※permanent forest production§ to provide timber, protect watersheds and contribute to local economic stability.In its lawsuit, AFRC claims that Obama＊s monument expansion violated the 1937 law by banning most commercial logging. A few other parties, including a regional wood products manufacturer called Murphy Company and an alliance of county governments, filed similar lawsuits last winter.While this fight is about timber production on public lands, it also reflects the sense among some people that the federal government is an overweening bully trying to snuff out the economic and cultural heritage of rural westerners. Colleen Roberts, for instance, a Jackson County commissioner, sees the monument expansion as a top-down designation that will stifle local authority.※Another concern I personally have is just a continuation of federal land-grabbing,§ she says, sitting in front of an American flag in her Jackson County office. ※Constitutionally I don＊t know if that is what the federal government was supposed to do, to own all of our land and control it.§A similar mentality was on display last February, in what might be the Cascade-Siskiyou＊s most Bundy-esque moment. For one day, a caravan of big pickups descended on the area for an anti-monument rally meant to protect ※culture, heritage and livelihoods§. Scores of protesters drove to the Green Springs Inn, a small restaurant and hotel located on private property inside the Cascade-Siskiyou area and whose owners are ardent monument advocates. The rally featured a hodgepodge of members of interest groups from militia supporters to motorized vehicle proponents, who stood outside the inn and held signs reading ※New Endangered Species: Rural American§ and ※Quit Closing Roads§.※We really need to stick up for our culture,§ said Ryan Mallory, a local marketing consultant who helped organize the rally, during a radio interview in February. ※And in a way I feel like this is an attack on a culture, a culture of people that has been here for more than 150 years.§Diarmuid McGuire, one of the Green Springs Inn＊s proprietors, says the monument has helped business and ※put us on the map§. But it has also inflamed raw divisions.※You have two cultures with two totally different value systems and two different political agendas and in our community everyone is sort of amalgamated,§ McGuire says. ※It is a culture war, really, and when you organize a political rally around it, you get the anti-monument people, you get the gun people ... and then you get the anti-government militia mixed in, and we had them all here across the street.§ He points to his neighbor＊s property across the street, displaying a sign in block letters: ※NO MONUMENT OUR LAND OUR VOICE§.Steve Pedery of Oregon Wild says the forest products industry and its allies are trying to return Oregon to some long vanished golden era of timber riches. The industry, after all, has declined immensely in the state, from a peak of having nearly 90,000 direct payroll jobs in the 1950s to roughly 31,000 today.All the while, the outdoor recreation industry has blossomed, currently employing more than 140,000 people in Oregon, according to a report from the Outdoor Industry Association.In February and March, conservation groups like Oregon Wild, Willis＊s Soda Mountain Wilderness Council and some of their collaborators, fearing that the Trump administration might settle with the timber industry, lawyered up and intervened in the court cases in an attempt to defend the monument.Willis is troubled bythe lawsuits and Trump＊s monument review, but he and his allies have battled what he calls the ※timber-county industrial complex§ for years. It＊s been a hard slog to prevent timber sales, buy out grazing permits, limit off-road vehicle access and otherwise preserve and restore this place. Willis, who lost both feet and his fingers to frostbite during a Denali ascent decades ago, is a determined man. And no matter what transpires now, no matter what the secretary of the interior says or a distant judge declares, he＊ll keep fighting to protect the landscape he loves.※Love where you live,§ he says, riffing on a conservationist slogan. ※Defend what you love.§"																																																			
"n the outskirts of the Aboriginal town of Pormpuraaw 每 beyond the scented frangipani trees, the rows of bungalows, and the lush tropical greenery 每 is a mountainous rubbish tip. Locals have their own name for it: Bunnings.As if browsing the Australian hardware store it＊s named for, they pick through the tip for rubber, rope, bicycle rims. Detritus is then turned into art, woven with feathers and bones into the ocean sculptures that this remote Indigenous communityhas become famous for.※Bunnings§ isn＊t the only source of debris. On Pormpuraaw beach, an idyllic stretch of sand flats and crushed shells located on the west coast of Cape York peninsula, plastic fishing nets wash up on shore 每 some kilometres long.Thrown overboard by fishers, they are known as ※ghost nets§, eerie death traps that float through the currents, entrapping and killing marine life. The nets, once cleared away, form the frame of Pormpuraaw＊s ghost net sculptures, a highlight of July＊s Cairns  fair.※It＊s a particularly vile form of pollution,§ says the manager of the Pormpuraaw  and Culture Centre, Paul Jakubowski, 57, as he looks out to sea. ※Three hundred and ninety by-species are killed in the nets, including things like sea turtles, and dolphins and whales. You＊re affecting a traditional food source and a very important current food source.§Sid Bruce Short Joe, a flamboyant artist who pairs his shaggy white beard with a red Hawaiian shirt, recalls a time growing up when sawfish, or ※kapainyinh§, in his Kugu language, were plentiful. Now in his 50s, the first sawfish he has seen in years was in an aquarium in Europe, where Short Joe travelled to exhibit at the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco last year (he shared a private dinner with Prince Albert II).※When I see the sawfish I felt it in here,§ says Short Joe, banging his heart. He is snacking on slices of cucumber in the art centre, where ghost net sculptures hang from the ceiling or sprawl, unfinished, across the floor. ※It＊s just like I was already connected to it again.※After the monsoon we find fish along the beach. Sometimes turtles. The last one I saw was a porpoise. Sawfish. Bullsharks. We don＊t want them to get extinct.§ Last month Short Joe also travelled to New York, .Shut off during the wet season, Pormpuraaw (meaning ※entranceway to a house§ in the Kuuk Thaayorre language) is only accessible from December to April via small aircraft. Situated some 650km by road from Cairns, it is home to both the saltwater Thaayorre and freshwater Wik people, and was established as an Anglican mission in 1939.Today the population numbers about 700. Facilities are scarce and opportunities scarcer: there is no high school, electricity is supplied via a diesel generator and (expensive) fresh vegetables are transported by plane. Like many remote Aboriginal communities, English is often a fourth or fifth language and unemployment is high, leading to alcohol and drug abuse, with grog tightly controlled. On hot, sticky evenings skinny mutts prowl the streets, howling into the still air. Short Joe, who speaks 10 languages and is a member of a Wik clan, remembers a time when his family hunted in the bush or fished in the seas for sustenance.※Those days, my people can just roam and everything was there for them, they were never short of anything: yam, fish, mammals, marsupials, reptiles 每 they were all there,§ he says. ※Before dollars came, everything was out there for my people.§With much of the population mired in poverty, art provides an income. The sculptures can sell for up to $15,000, with 65% going to the artist and 35% to the art centre. While they are not a traditional art form, weaving 每 particularly of dilly bags 每 is, and the ghost net sculptures are created in the shape of the artists＊ totems, connecting the art to country.Totems are the artists＊ ※connection to past ancestors§, explains the art centre manager Jakubowski, an American who moved to Pormpuraaw eight years ago. ※It is how they trace genealogy, it is how they claim land.※So it＊s a very traditional theme behind the work but done in modern materials that are found and recycled ＃ I like to think the ghost net work embraces the past and the future.§Art, insists Jakubowski, is a ※great enabler ＃ People tell me they＊re closing the gap, but the gap is wide open. It＊s tough, you get to year seven and there＊s nowhere to go. There＊s no employment 每 the arts centre is the only export industry.§Short Joe agrees. ※Every time I see Paris in the TV or movies, one day I want to go there, but how am I going to get there?§ he asks. ※Then my art took me. It was just like a dream to me. Yes, my art was just like a dream.§Steven Keeper, 39, shows off his new sculpture: a vast whale tail that seems to splash out from the floor. ※I like how it helps us engage with others,§ he says. With 10 children to support, the Torres Strait Islander artist, who lives in Pormpuraaw with his partner,is keen to ※create wealth within my own family. And it＊s been steady for me 每 I＊ve been selling artwork continuously.§But Keeper, like most of the sculptors, has a bigger concern: his sons and daughters, he fears, might not enjoy the ocean life he has grown up with or the fruits of fishing, which, when you dodge the lazy, fat crocodiles that line the muddy Munkan river, is how many a local wiles away an afternoon. ※We don＊t want to see anything disappear,§ Keeper says. Crouching on the sand, next to his effigy of a giant orange crab, another artist, Michael Norman, solemnly nods his head. ※It＊s for the kids,§ he says. ※For the future.§"																																																			
"The federal government has called for more areas of north-west  to be placed in reserve as part of a conservation plan designed to protect the endangered giant freshwater crayfish.The crayfish, , can weigh up to 6kg and live for 60 years. Commonly called the giant freshwater lobster, it is the largest invertebrate in the world and endemic to the cool rivers of northern Tasmania, although habitat restriction and poaching have forced it to retract to areas west of Launceston. There is no official population count but researcher Todd Walsh, who has been studying the species for 20 years, says the numbers are less than 20% of what they would have been pre-colonisation. Walsh said locals had a deep affection for the weird creatures, which have been known to turn up on the footpaths of country towns and in the middle of paddocks.※There was a lady that used to open up a gate every year to let a lobster go down to her dam, and then a few months later it would be back, wanting to go the other way,§ he said. ※It was just sitting there at the gate.§The pincers of mature male freshwater crayfish were big enough to wrap around the calf of an adult human, Walsh said, and they had been known to hold 每 and crush 每 beer bottles.※These are supremely impressive animals,§ he said. ※In the Amazon and the Nile and the Mississippi, there＊s nothing without a backbone that＊s bigger than these animals.※It＊s an icon species. Everyone＊s got a story about lobsters.§The species is listed as vulnerable in the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act and under Tasmanian legislation, and endangered on the ICUN Red List of Threatened Species. A new government recovery plan, signed by the federal and state governments, and , suggests that their numbers could decline further without improved monitoring and greater protection.Walsh said the biggest threat to the survival of the species was sediment, which is increased by clearfell logging operations. Sediment is a problem for baby crayfish in particular, because they hide under rocks and logs at the edges of the creek for seven years until they grow large enough to fend for themselves in open water. Females do not reach breeding age until they are 14, and mate biennially. Although they have between 224 and 1,300 eggs, which they gestate for nine months, few of the hatchlings survive to be independent juveniles. ※The sediment just covers their homes when they are little,§ Walsh said. ※A small baby lobster is the size of your fingernail, and at seven years old they will still sit on your hand, so they have to hide. The sediment just fills up those holes and then they have got nowhere to hide and they either get eaten or starve.§He said streamside reserves, which protected vegetation within 30 metres of the creek bank in areas where crayfish were known to reside, did not minimise the impact of sediment washed into the catchment by forestry operations upstream.According to the recovery plan, there are permanent production forests in 17 of the 22 catchments where the species is known to occur, or is likely to occur. Twelve of those catchments also have ※substantial§ areas under protection, mainly through regional reserves. The recovery plan recommends increasing the areas of lobster habitat under reserve, as well as improving forest management practices to reduce the impact of logging on sediment levels, and greater monitoring of the industry to ensure compliance with strict management prescriptions. It also recommends greater efforts by the Tasmania police to reduce poaching, including possibly setting cameras at key fishing sites and putting boom gates across forest access roads, which are used by poachers to access lobster-rich creeks.Under the now defunct Tasmanian Forestry Agreement (TFA), struck by the former Labor government, areas marked as future potential production forests in key lobster catchments would have transitioned into formal reserves within the next 10 years. But the Hodgman government  and has pledged to open up forestry reserves, which conservationists say . ※I＊m not Liberal, Labor, or Greens 每 I＊m lobsters,§ Walsh said. ※But the Labor government to their credit got all of the people to the table. Everyone was OK with it and said we have got a good deal here, and then eight months later the current government comes along and says: ＆nah, bugger it, let＊s scrap the lot＊.§ The Wilderness Society, which along with the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union was one of the key architects of the TFA, welcomed the ※strong§ recovery plan but said it would succeed only if the Tasmanian government followed the recommendations.※As we have seen in the past, strong plans for the lobster mean nothing if there is not the political will and funding to implement outcomes on the ground,§ the society＊s campaign director, Vica Bayley, said."																																																			
"The federal government is in denial about the effects of toxic firefighting foam and has failed to help trapped residents move, one of the lawyers bringing a class action against the defence department has said.Hundreds of residents living near the Oakey army aviation centre allege toxic chemicals used in firefighting foam have spread on to their land, entering their bloodstream by contaminating groundwater and food sources.Shine Lawyers, which is running the class action, alleges more than 4,000 residents have been affected in Oakey, near Toowoomba, west of Brisbane. The class action, involving more than 450 residents, has been launched in the federal court in New South Wales. Shine＊s special counsel Peter Shannon said the position of the federal government flew in the face of international evidence on the effects of the chemicals.※Every single scientific report is going one way and yet Defence continue to say, well, you can＊t prove this,§ he said.The chemicals 每 perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) 每 were developed in the 1940s by the corporate giant 3M and are used to provide resistance to heat, or for dispersion, wetting and surface treatments. They have been used in firefighting foams, as well as common household products such as Scotchgard, Teflon, fabric protectors and non-stick cookware.The chemicals came to public attention through the  in the US, which prompted a massive class action and an investigation by an independent panel of experts, .The panel, which finished its work in 2013, found the chemicals had probable links to high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer and pregnancy-induced hypertension. The US Environmental Protection Agency ordered 3M to cease production in 2000.More recently, the UN＊s persistent organic  that the chemicals had significant human and environmental health effects. It found them likely to ※lead to significant adverse human health and environmental effects such that global action is warranted§.Defence and the Coalition, however, have  showing a consistent link between the chemicals and adverse health outcomes.Shannon said the commonwealth, meant to act as a model litigant, was setting a poor example through its response. He said millions of dollars had been spent on testing, experts and consultants but nothing on helping affected residents move.※They＊ve spent millions, and yet not one red cent has gone to getting people who are trapped out of there,§ Shannon said.He said promises from defence of compensation and action had failed to materialise and Oakey residents had ※run out of patience§.※People have been trapped there for almost three years now with no option,§ Shannon told Guardian Australia. ※It is not a wealthy community, people have their life savings tied up in their homes, and they simply can＊t move, they＊re trapped.§It is the second class action launched against defence over its use of the chemicals. Residents of Williamtown, near Newcastle, launched a similar case late last year over .Williamtown residents welcomed news of the Oakley case on Tuesday. Speaking on behalf of the Williamtown class action steering committee, Lindsay Clout predicted there would be further court action over what was ※clearly a national issue§. ※There is no question that this will continue to build as the scientific evidence about the dangers of PFOS and PFOA mounts,＊ he said in a statement to Guardian Australia. ※Rather than drag this on, Defence needs to do the right thing and take action to help the families and businesses impacted by its contamination.§The two court actions are being run by different firms, but are funded by the commercial litigant funding firm IMF Bentham.  Defence is  around more than a dozen bases across the country. But Shannon said the firm believed contamination had occurred at 60 bases 每 of which Oakey was the worst 每 and court action was likely to arise from about 16 sites.

"US diplomats should sidestep questions from foreign governments on what it would take for the Trump administration to re-engage in the global , according to a diplomatic cable seen by Reuters.The cable, sent by the US secretary of state, , to embassies on Friday, also said diplomats should make clear the United States wants to help other countries use fossil fuels. In the wake of Donald Trump＊s , the cable tells diplomats to expect foreign government representatives to ask questions like: ※Does the United States have a climate change policy?§ and ※Is the administration advocating the use of fossil fuels over renewable energy?※ If asked, for example, ※What is the process for consideration of re-engagement in the Paris Agreement?,§ the answer should be vague: ※We are considering a number of factors. I do not have any information to share on the nature or timing of the process,§ the cable advises. The US state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cable. Trump campaigned on a promise to ※cancel§ the Paris deal, saying he believed it would cost the US economy trillions of dollars, while leaving developing nations such as China unfettered. In a sharp difference with the previous administration of Barack Obama, a Democrat, Trump has several times called climate change a hoax. In June, Trump left the door open to re-engagement if terms improve. The United States would ※start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that＊s fair§, he said. The state department guidance clarifies that right now, ※there are no plans to seek to re-negotiate or amend the text of the .§ But it adds: ※The president is sincere in his commitment to look for a path to re-engage that takes into account his concerns for US economic growth and energy security.§ The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit planetary warming by curbing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists believe drive global warming. The United States, under the Obama administration, had promised to cut emissions as much as 28% from 2005 levels by 2025.Separate from the diplomatic cable, the  is reviewing a draft report written by scientists across 13 federal government agencies that shows the effects of climate change pose dire, near-term threats to the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on the draft, which the New York Times published on Monday. The report puts the White House in the awkward position of either clearing the report＊s findings or editing them.The diplomatic guidance makes clear that the United States intends to attend global climate summits during the prolonged process of withdrawing from the Paris deal, to protect US interests. The next summit is in November. A US official said a major US priority in these talks would be to beat back attempts to have separate standards in the guidance on emissions cuts for rich and poor nations 每 long a sticking point in negotiations. ※There＊s certainly nothing in the policies of this administration that would make us think that we should be acting differently,§ the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal memo. The cable also anticipates questions over why the United States has changed its policy to make it easier for global development banks such as the World Bank to finance coal-fired power projects. In 2013 the Obama administration said the United States would oppose most coal projects, guidance since altered by the Trump administration. ※The new principles will allow the [United States] the flexibility to approve, as appropriate, a broad range of power projects, including the generation of power using clean and efficient fossil fuels and renewable energy,§ the cable said.

Had you set out to estrange people from the living world, you could scarcely have done better.Even the term ※reserve§ is cold and alienating 每 think of what we mean when we use that word about a person. ※The environment§ is just as bad: an empty word that creates no pictures in the mind. Wild animals and plants are described as ※resources§ or ※stocks§, as if they belong to us and their role is to serve us: a notion disastrously extended by the term .Our assaults on life and beauty are also sanitised and disguised by the words we use. When a species is obliterated by people, we use the term ※extinction§. It conveys no sense of our role in the extermination, and mixes up this eradication with the natural turnover of species. It＊s like calling murder ※expiration§. ※Climate change§ also confuses natural variation with the catastrophic disruption we cause: a confusion deliberately exploited by those who deny our role. (Even this neutral term has now been .) I still see ecologists referring to ※improved§ pasture, meaning land from which all life has been erased other than a couple of plant species favoured for grazing or silage. We need a new vocabulary.Words possess a remarkable . The organisation  in which participants were asked to play a game. One group was told it was called the ※Wall Street Game§, while another was asked to play the ※Community Game§. It was the same game. But when it was called the Wall Street Game, the participants were consistently more selfish and more likely to betray the other players. There were similar differences between people performing a ※consumer reaction study§ and a ※citizen reaction study§: the questions were the same, but when?people saw themselves as consumers, they were more likely to associate materialistic values with positive emotions.Words encode values that are subconsciously triggered when we hear them. When certain phrases are repeated, they can , making it hard for us to see?an issue differently. Advertisers and spin doctors understand this all too well: they know that they can trigger certain responses by using certain language. But many of those who seek to defend the living planet seem impervious to this intelligence.The catastrophic failure by ecologists to listen to what  has led to the worst framing of all: . This term informs us?that nature is subordinate to the human economy, and loses its value?when it cannot be measured by money. It leads almost inexorably to the claim made : ※The critical role of a properly functioning natural environment is delivering economic?prosperity.§By framing the living world in this way, we bury the issues that money cannot measure. In England and Wales, according to a parliamentary report, the . When we read such statements, we absorb the implicit suggestion that this loss could be redeemed by money.

I joined the people quietly processing up the bank to their lodge.

When first a kingfisher appeared, then a beaver, you could read the enchantment and delight in every face. Our awe of nature, and the silence we must observe when we watch wild animals, hints, I believe, at the origins of religion.So why do those who seek to protect the living planet 每 and who were doubtless inspired to devote their lives to it through the same sense of wonder and reverence 每 so woefully fail to capture these values in the way they name the world?Those who name it own it. The scientists who coined the term ※sites of special scientific interest§ were 每 doubtless unwittingly 每 staking a claim: this place is important because it is of interest to us. Those who describe the tiny fragments of seabed in which no commercial fishing is allowed as ※reference areas§ are telling us that the meaning and purpose of such places is as a scientific benchmark. Yes, they play that role. But to most people who dive there, they represent much more: miraculous refuges, thronged with creatures that thrill and astonish.Rather than arrogating naming rights to themselves, professional ecologists should recruit poets and cognitive linguists and amateur nature lovers to help them . Here are a few ideas. I hope, in?the comments that follow this article online, you can improve and add to?them.If we called protected areas ※places of natural wonder§, we would not only speak to people＊s love of nature, but also establish an aspiration that conveys what they ought to be. Let＊s stop using the word environment, and use terms such as ※living planet§ and ※natural world§ instead, as they allow us to form a picture of what we are describing. Let＊s abandon the term climate change and start saying ※climate breakdown§. Instead of extinction, let＊s adopt the word .We are blessed with a wealth of nature and a wealth of language.

"n a bold new strategy unveiled on Monday in the Guardian, the US Department of Agriculture 每 guardians of the planet＊s richest farmlands 每 has .Under guidance from the agency＊s director of soil health, Bianca Moebius-Clune, a list of phrases to be avoided includes ※climate change§ and ※climate change adaptation§, to be replaced by ※weather extremes§ and ※resilience to weather extremes§.Also blacklisted is the scary locution ※reduce greenhouse gases§ 每 and here, the agency＊s linguists have done an even better job of camouflage: the new and approved term is ※increase nutrient use efficiency§. The effectiveness of this approach 每 based on the well-known principle that what you can＊t say won＊t hurt you 每 has previously been tested at the state level, making use of the ※policy laboratories§ provided by America＊s federalist system. In 2012, for instance, the North Carolina general assembly voted to prevent communities from planning for sea level rise. Early analysis suggests this legislation has been ineffective: Hurricane Matthew, in 2016, for instance drove storm surge from the Atlantic ocean to historic levels along the Cape Fear river. Total damage from the storm was estimated at $4.8bn. Further south,  in 2014 每 one government official, answering questions before the legislature, repeatedly used the phrase ※the issue you mentioned earlier§ in a successful effort to avoid using the taboo words. It is true that the next year ※unprecedented§ coral bleaching blamed on rising temperatures destroyed vast swaths of the state＊s reefs: from Key Biscayne to Fort Lauderdale, a survey found that ※about two-thirds were dead or reduced to less than half of their live tissue§. Still, it＊s possible that they simply need to increase their nutrient use efficiency. At the federal level, the new policy has yet to show clear-cut success either. As the say-no-evil policy has rolled out in the early months of the Trump presidency, it coincided with the onset of a truly dramatic ※flash drought§ across much of the nation＊s wheat belt. As the Farm Journal website pointed out earlier last week: ※Crops in the Dakotas and Montana are baking on an anvil of severe drought and extreme heat, as bone-dry conditions force growers and ranchers to make difficult decisions regarding cattle, corn and wheat.§ In typically negative journalistic fashion, the Farm Journal reported that ※abandoned acres, fields with zero emergence, stunted crops, anemic yields, wheat rolled into hay, and early herd culls comprise a tapestry of disaster for many producers§. Which is why it＊s good news for the new strategy that the USDA has filled its vacant position of chief scientist with someone who knows the power of words. In fact, Sam Clovis, the new chief scientist, , or has degrees in science, but instead formerly served in the demanding task of rightwing radio host (where he pointed out that followers of former president Obama were ※Maoists§). He has actually used the words ※climate change§ in the past, but only to dismiss it as ※junk science§.  Under his guidance the new policy should soon yield results, which is timely since recent research (carried out, it must be said, by scientist scientists at MIT) showed that ※climate change could deplete some US water basins and dramatically reduce crop yields in some areas by 2050§. But probably not if we don＊t talk about it."

Every year, about half a trillion new bottles are produced, and many billions end up in landfill, the sea or the environment.Plastic is now present in  and . As the Guardian considers the extent of this crisis, we look at six simple things you can do to stop contributing to the issue, starting today.The simplest thing you can do to reduce your contribution to the plastic mountain is to find a water bottle that you like enough to use more than once. There are multiple options to suit every taste. From stainless steel, bamboo or glass, to bottles with an option to add fruit to flavour the water, or flasks with filters that promise extra purity. Find the one that works for you.Earlier this year  the Ooho, a fully biodegradable water-filled orb made of two layers of seaweed-based packaging. The biodegradable outside layer can be recycled, while the inside is edible and can be eaten as you drink the water (or discarded, as you wish).The orbs are made using a culinary process that  and are able to hold up to a litre of water. Ooho orbs are not on the market yet but the  they could be cheaper to produce than plastic bottles.Since the early noughties, staying hydrated has become . A commodity that is free from the tap is now shipped from Fiji and sold for up to . The marketing suggests that those clutching a bottle of water both look and feel healthier. Public health guidelines recommend  a day. Some scientists have suggested that ※§ is enough to keep us ticking over, even when we are doing strenuous exercise. Either way, nowhere does it say that you will be better hydrated if your water is sourced from a tropical rainforest 每 or that constantly hydrating as you travel from A to B is necessary. Perhaps a glass at home and then one when you get to work will suffice? Pluck up the courage to ask for the free refill to which you are legally entitled in the UK. In a , 71% of consumers admitted to feeling uncomfortable when asking for free tap water from an establishment if they hadn＊t purchased anything. And 30% of people said they would still feel awkward asking for a free refill even if they  bought other food or drinks. This might be daunting, but there is a whole  to helping you. The  has been handing out water drop stickers to businesses to show people they are happy to offer them water for free. There is even an app that tells you which nearby business are participating in the scheme before you leave the house. According to Beth Terry, who blogs about being a reformed , one route to a plastic-free life is to make the toiletries you would usually buy in plastic containers. Baking soda combined with salt can be used to make toothpaste,, or added to apple cider vinegar to make shampoo.  suggest forgoing shampoo altogether: the theory goes that while the first few weeks will be greasy and horrible your hair and scalp gradually adjust to self-cleaning. If that sounds too extreme  could be a good compromise. At the very least you can buy in bulk to reduce plastic packaging waste. Indeed, inventive shopping can have an instant impact on your plastic bottle consumption. Paperboard packaging is a better way to buy soups and juices. Soda drinks come in cans as well as bottles.And f are a good alternative to buying bottles of mineral water. Even with the best intentions, there will probably be times when you have no choice but to drink from a plastic bottle. If this happens, the key is to make sure you recycle the bottle correctly so that it can be repurposed. There are some ingenious examples of bottle reuse around the world. In Brazil plastic bottles have been bound together and transformed into solar heaters. In Algeria they have been  and used to clad walls in houses for refugees; and in India, a local enterprise recently made a bus shelter out of ."																																																			
"In what is believed to be a world first, one of the rarest spiders has been bred in captivity at  Zoo Gardens. More than 1,000 Desertas wolf spiderlings, classed as critically endangered, have hatched. Keepers hand-reared some from tiny eggs as they are so precious. At birth, they measure 4mm across, but they will grow to 12cm, with a 4cm body.The species is found in a single valley on Deserta Grande, one of the Desertas islands near Madeira, . There are about 4,000 adults left in the wild and it is hoped that some of the spiderlings can be returned to their home.Mark Bushell, curator of invertebrates at Bristol zoo, travelled to Deserta Grande last year and collected 25 of the spiders to breed. ※Because this was the first time this species had ever been taken into captivity to breed, it was a steep learning curve,§ he said. ※After some of the female spiders were mated, it was an anxious wait to see if they would produce egg sacs. We were thrilled when they did, and to see the tiny spiderlings emerge was fantastic 每 a real career highlight.§The spiders are classified as critically endangered on the International Union for  of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species. They are under threat from habitat loss due to invasive grass binding the soil where they burrow and blocking their shelters. Bristol zoo has joined forces with the Instituto das Florestas e Conserva??o de Natureza and the IUCN to develop a strategy to protect the spiders. When one of the egg sacs broke, the conservationists carefully transferred the eggs into a miniature incubator. Once they hatched, they were placed in separate containers with sterilised soil, kept in quarantine and individually fed with fruit flies. Bristol zoo plans to send hundreds of the spiderlings to zoos across the UK and Europe to set up further breeding points. ※Establishing the world＊s first captive breeding programme for this species is a fantastic step towards protecting it,§ Bushell added. ※It is a beautiful and impressive creature, but its natural habitat is being altered by invasive plants. ※There are not enough rocky and sandy areas left for the spiders to burrow and hide in. The spiders are competing for fewer and fewer burrows.§Horticulture experts from the zoo hope to visit Deserta Grande to begin to restore the original landscape."																																																			
"The UK risks becoming the ※dirty man of Europe§ after Brexit with no plan to deal with the  dumped by consumers every week, according to politicians and leading environmental campaigners.The EU is currently drawing up an ambitious ※circular economy§ strategy which aims to make manufacturers take greater responsibility for the way the billions of plastic bottles produced each year are disposed of, collected and recycled. But leading EU figures and environmental groups warn that the UK will not be bound by the new deal once outside the EU and so risks becoming .Javor Benedek, vice-chair of the EU environment committee, said: ※The UK risks falling behind the rest of the EU in the way it deals with the issue of plastic waste and plastic bottles, with little effort for waste prevention and better recycling, less onus on big producers to take responsibility and ultimately more plastic ending up in illegal dump sites or the ocean.§He added: ※There is a real danger it will become the  in terms of waste management and plastic bottles in particular.§New figures obtained by the Guardian reveal that people bought more than 480bn plastic drinking bottles around the world in 2016, and that demand will soar another 20% by 2021.The EU has been working on the circular economy strategy for several years. Before the end of 2017 the European council, the European commission and parliament are expected to hammer out a final agreement, although it may not come fully into force for up to three years.The package aims to create a ※concrete and ambitious programme of action§ which covers the whole cycle of goods: from production and consumption to waste management and recycling. It would make manufacturers responsible for their products for their lifetime and bring in ambitious targets for recycling and waste management.The UK government says it is taking the issue of plastic bottles seriously. A Defra spokesperson said: ※We have made great progress in boosting recycling rates for plastic bottles, with their collection for recycling rising from less than 13,000 tonnes in 2000 to over 330,000 tonnes in 2015. ※We will continue to address the impacts of plastics waste as we leave the EU, as part of our ambition to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state.§But Lib Dem MEP Catherine Bearder, who also sits on the EU environment committee, said that without the legislative and enforcement framework provided by the EU the government was unlikely to have the resources or political will to develop an equivalent system.※The new Tory government is not one that respects the environment,§ she said. ※There is a real danger we will fall behind [the rest of Europe] in terms of the onus we place on big corporations to take responsibility for their waste, which could have big consequences on trade.§She added: ※My fear is that these negotiations on the circular economy package will not be completed until after we leave so even if the government commits to abide by all existing rules in a trade deal it may well not include this.§She called for a new body to oversee environmental issues from  to air pollution.But she warned: ※That will take resources and political will 每 neither of which seems likely with a Tory government. This is not a priority for them but it is an urgent priority for future generations and for the planet.§Caroline Lucas, the Green party＊s joint leader and sole MP, said the EU had been essential for environmental protections. She warned that with  and the Tories in coalition with the ※§the ※UK risks becoming an off-shore pollution haven§.She added that people＊slives were ※awash with throwaway plastic§ and said the government must do more to address the issue.※If we＊re going to protect our oceans and our countryside we need to end the age of single-use plastics. It＊s time for government, working alongside industry 每 and drinks companies in particular 每 to take drastic action.§Scientists fear that chemicals in plastics and also chemicals which attach themselves to plastic in the natural environment could cause poisoning, infertility and genetic disruption in marine life, and potentially in humans if ingested in high quantities. Pieter Depous, policy director at the European Environmental Bureau, which represents 141 environment organisations and NGOs across , said marine pollution ※knows no borders and it＊s in the interest of all European citizens, including the British people, to find a common solution§. But he warned that the ※frequently touted ＆low tax, low regulation＊ economic model suggested by Theresa May will most likely result in lower domestic fees for producer responsibility.§※There will be fewer incentives to manufacture reusable and recyclable packaging solutions, which will in turn lead to more resources being used and more plastic ending up in the ocean.§"																																																			
"The environment has been shut out of this election. Economic growth has provided the world with abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials. However, unmanaged it is destroying the ecosystem, wiping out fauna, flora, forests and seas. An ecological meltdown will cause economic ruin and political turmoil, and threaten the very existence of human civilisation. Air pollution causes 40,000 premature deaths in the UK each year. With greenhouse gases and habitat depletion, together, they are having a catastrophic effect on our environment, contributing to global climate change, wildlife, crop and forest damage, rising sea levels, floods and haze. Whole countries could drown under water or starve under drought, driving migration and climate wars.The path to a sustainable future requires the creative power of our best scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs, backed by the courage of politicians to think long term.  is an act of environmental vandalism on a global scale. And , Theresa May is aiding and abetting him. Only the Lib Dems combine the ambition to bring forward climate change targets and support for the Paris agreement with an entrepreneurial approach to investing in cutting-edge clean technologies, and commitment to international institutions to enable Britain to be a world leader in protecting the global environment. Britain has been part of the cause. By supporting the Lib Dems on 8 June, Britain can also be part of the solution.    Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens are each too tribal to form a progressive alliance, but we voters can help.

"he United States has abdicated responsibility from the  每 going where, in refusing to play by globally agreed rules. While this is a blow for the fight against climate change, recent history suggests that a new ※G3§ 每 the EU, China and India 每 can fill the vacuum in leadership, plus the private sector in the US is already committed to renewable energy.There are three reasons to be hopeful:The US is a leading source of renewable energy technology and finance, and is at the forefront of research around emerging frontiers such as . It has pledged the largest amount to the  ($3bn) of which $1bn . The rest of the contribution is now threatened, which could be an impediment to technology transfer to the developing world. However the American private sector is likely to step up in its quest to reach global markets and push towards price competitiveness as well. Signals from industry support this 每 General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt : ※Industry must now lead and not depend on government.§On the financing side, the increasing value of renewables may mitigate the effect of any reductions to the Green Climate Fund. For example, 2016  in many countries where the cost of solar energy was well below the cost of power from coal.There have been worries that the US exit from the Paris Agreement will trigger others to do the same. This is unlikely as narratives have shifted away from this being a zero-sum game, towards being a goal that is worth acting upon in national interest. A move away from fossil fuels used to imply losing global competitiveness, but now the prices of renewable energy now suggest otherwise.Europe and the global south, including rising powers India and China remain  to the Paris Agreement, fighting climate change and adopting renewable energy. The boom in renewable energy investments in India, China, Japan, US and EU countries have led renewable prices to plummet; this is unlikely to abate.We believe that all is not lost 每 the stars are aligning towards a new triumvirate, consisting of India,  and the EU, that can lead the fight against climate change. Each will bring a unique but complementary set of leadership qualities.The EU is showing strong leadership on climate change. Several European countries have developed renewable-friendly policies; almost 90% of new capacity in Europe in 2016 . A strong private sector has been expanding globally as well. Statements made by the leadership 每 such as the , and Italy, France and Germany＊s refusal to renegotiate Paris 每 are positive signs. The combined EU pledge to the Green Climate Fund, at $4.8bn, is significant; however, financing flows towards the global south will have to increase, through the development finance or private investment. We don＊t know whether that will happen, although the EU is showing signs of a more assertive foreign policy (in response to Brexit, a withdrawing America, and a more assertive Russia) and the architects of a new EU consensus on development are promising to .China has articulated , and has backed it up with . While meeting domestic targets will support the Paris Agreement＊s agenda, it could step into more of a global leadership role by extending its expertise and financial support for infrastructure in developing countries. This can be done by including it as a core component to its various bilateral project development initiatives (such as in Africa), as well as by leveraging multilateral institutions such as the New Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.For India, a knowledge-rich and resource-lite approach may be the most feasible due to financial constraints. It has been , and could well exceed Paris targets 每 the draft National Electricity Plan projects that 57% of electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027, compared to the Paris target of 40% by 2030. This plan projects that no new coal-based power will be required; the  back this up. India has also pushed for a commercially sound policy framework, exemplified by its auction system. Though not without flaws, India＊s experiences are invaluable and can be shared with other developing countries through research and development, capacity building, technical assistance and project development via experienced Indian firms. One promising route is through the  (hosted by India), which will seek to promote innovative policies, demonstration projects, and capacity building measures, as well as leverage financial instruments to mobilise over While the American exit has been a setback for the global fight against climate change, , China and EU should view this as an opportunity to lead. This will not, by itself, close the gap to achieve the two degrees Celsius goal, but it could flip the narrative and propel a virtuous cycle of action by others. Supported by a sound commercial argument, now is the time for the new G3 to demonstrate climate leadership."																																																			
"Children as young as eight, working in the  producing leather that is in demand across Europe and the USA, are exposed to toxic chemical cocktails that are likely to shorten their lives, according to a new report.Approximately 90% of those who live and work in the overcrowded urban slums of Hazaribagh and Kamrangirchar, where hazardous chemicals are discharged into the air, streets and river, die before they reach 50, according to the World  Organisation.Their plight spurred the volunteer doctors of M谷decins Sans Fronti豕res (MSF) to set up clinics in the area to diagnose and treat those who are the victims of their workplace. It is, says , ※the first time they have intervened in an area for reasons other than natural disasters or war§. MSF＊s intervention was triggered by ※the widespread industrial negligence and apathy of owners of tanneries and other hazardous material factories§ towards the more than 600,000 largely migrant population who have no access to government-funded healthcare.MSF set up and ran four main clinics for 5,000 workers in 2015, located in the centre of communities involved in four different manufacturing processes at factories for tanning, plastics recycling, garment-making and metals.The hazards of the 250 or so tanneries in Hazaribagh 每 which are 30 to 35 years old and discharge 6,000 cubic metres of toxic effluent and 10 tonnes of solid waste every day 每 are best known. In 2012, Human Rights Watch produced a report called which revealed the flouting of Bangladesh＊s own laws as well as international law in the employment of children under 18 in work that is harmful or hazardous.The factories douse animal skins in cauldrons of chemicals as part of the processing of ※Bengali black§ leather, which is exported to European leather goods manufacturers in Italy, Spain and elsewhere.※Apart from heavy metals like chromium, cadmium, lead and mercury, a conglomerate of chemicals are discharged by the tanneries into the environment,§ says the paper. ※Workers aged eight and older are soaked to the skin, breathing the fumes for most of the day and eat and live in these surroundings throughout the year. Personal protective equipment [is] not provided.§Child workers clad in no more than loin cloths and wellington boots are exposed to chemicals including formaldehyde, hydrogen sulphide and sulphuric acid, write Venkiteswaran Muralidhar, associate professor at the Sri Balaji Medical college in Chennai, and colleagues.The other factories每 for plastics recycling, garments and metals 每 are in Kamrangirchar, an urban slum which is not officially part of Dhaka city. ※In these, there are complex risk hazards from cotton dust, heavy metals and chemicals like mercury, phthalates, acids and dioxins and ergonomic hazards,§ says the paper.Chronic skin and lung diseases are common, say the authors. Within six months of the setting up of the clinics, 3,200 of the 5,000 eligible workers had come forward for at least one consultation. Among them, 468 (14.6%) were diagnosed with suspected work-related diseases, and 30 (0.9%) had work-related injuries.The figures do not reflect the overall harm to the population, however, said Muralidhar. Those who are severely injured by chemicals or accidents would not go to one of the clinics. ※They will probably be taken by rickshaw to a hospital in Dhaka,§ he told the Guardian. And the clinics were only open four days a week, during the daytime, and workers needed the owner＊s permission to go for a consultation.He feels strongly that a hospital should be set up in the slum to help its people. ※They are the most horrible conditions you can imagine,§ he told the Guardian. ※I work in this area. I have never seen anything as bad as this.§"																																																			
"Tasmanian scientists will trial a new tactic this spring to help the shy albatross fight extinction: constructing artificial nests. Conservationists hope the nests will boost the population of the threatened seabird, which they believe is vulnerable to the environmental effects of climate change. Shy albatrosses only breed on , which host an estimated 1,500 breeding pairs. Scientists believe rising air temperatures during the chick-rearing period are lowering survival rates, and warming oceans mean birds have to travel further to find food for their children. Rachael Alderman, who has been studying the birds since 2003, said she hoped the artificial nests would boost the number of chicks that survive. ※The species is particularly vulnerable to rapid change because of their biology,§ she said. ※They only lay one egg each year. They live for a long time. And they have what we would call a low reproductive outcome.§Alderman said shy albatrosses form long-term monogamous pair bonds and have elaborate courtship rituals, which means they usually do not mate until they are up to eight years old. ※Their strategy in life is to live long and put lots of energy into their individual breeding attempts. So if something happens to make that harder to achieve, their populations really do suffer.§With $110,000 from the federal government, as well as funding from the Tasmanian Department of theEnvironment, the CSIRO and WWF Australia, Alderman plans to install 100 nests this year before the breeding season starts in September. The nests will be approximately 1 metre wide and 30cm high. The shy albatross is  by the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. According to the international union for the conservation of nature, the bird was  and reduced to a population of 600 in the 19th century. By 2004 it had reached only 25% of its pre-exploitation population. WWF Australia＊s head of living ecosystems, Darren Grover, said scientists would also place satellite trackers on new chicks and juvenile birds, and praised the nests for being an ※innovative idea§. ※It＊s often really difficult to have a level of impact for marine species, especially when species like albatrosses spend so much time at sea. So having an impact on breeding islands is a great opportunity to help the population. ※[Satellite trackers] will give researchers a better idea of where the birds are going, whether they are interacting with fishing, and tracking where they are getting food.§Shy albatrosses have an average wingspan of 220cm to 256cm, and an average weight of 4.1 kg. The bird ordinarily ranges across southern Australia, from as far west as Carnarvon in Perth and north-east as Stradbroke Island in Queensland.They lay only one egg per breeding period and incubate it for 72 days. Both parents then spend approximately five months feeding and caring for the chick before it becomes independent. "																																																			
"Antarctica＊s pristine ice-white environment is  and facing an unexpected threat 每 from the common house fly. Scientists say that as temperatures soar in the polar region, invading plants and insects, including the fly, pose a major conservation threat.More and more of these invaders, in the form of larvae or seeds, are surviving in coastal areas around the south pole, where temperatures have risen by more than 3C over the past three decades. Glaciers have retreated, exposing more land which has been colonised by mosses that have been found to be growing more quickly and thickly than ever before 每 providing potential homes for invaders. The process is particularly noticeable in the Antarctic peninsula, which has been shown to be the region of the continent that is most vulnerable to global warming.※The common house fly is a perfect example of the problem the Antarctic now faces from invading species,§ said Dominic Hodgson of the British Antarctic Survey. ※It comes in on ships, where it thrives in kitchens and then at bases on the continent. It now has an increasing chance of surviving in the Antarctic as it warms up, and that is a worry. Insects like the fly carry pathogens that could have a devastating effect on indigenous lifeforms.§The Antarctic has several native species of insects. Together with its indigenous mosses and lichens, these are now coming under increased threat from three major sources: visiting scientists; swelling numbers of tourists; and global warming.In 2015-6, more than 38,000 tourists visited  while around 43,000 were expected for the following season. ※These tourists are often very scrupulous about not leaving waste or having mud 每 which could carry seeds or bugs from other areas 每 on their boots when they set foot on the Antarctic peninsula,§ said Hodgson.※However, it is still very difficult to avoid contamination. Camera bags are a particular problem. People take them from one continent to the next and rarely clean them. They put them on the ground and seeds picked up elsewhere get shaken loose. It is a real issue.§Nevertheless, it is global warming that is the main driver of the greening of Antarctica. Temperatures have been rising steadily in the peninsula since meteorological data began to be collected there in the 1950s. This shows that over the past 60 years the region has warmed up by around half a degree Celsius every decade.As a result, the Antarctic＊s scarce plant life 每 which currently grows on only 0.3% of the continent 每 has responded dramatically, according to British researchers writing in . The group, led by Dan Charman of Exeter University, studied cores drilled into moss banks on islands off the peninsula and found that the rate of moss growth is four or five times higher than it was before 1950. ※The sensitivity of moss growth to past temperature rises suggests that ecosystems will alter rapidly under future warming, leading to major changes in the biology and landscape of the region,§ said Charman. ※In short, we could see Antarctic greening to parallel well-established observations in the Arctic.§More and more invasive plants 每 mostly non-native meadow grasses and sunflower species 每 have been found on the Antarctic peninsula and its islands and have required removal. In addition, a paper in  by Kevin Hughes of the British Antarctic Survey and others, indicates that current biosecurity measures to control these invasions are inadequate.To put this right, a number of measures are outlined by the group, which included scientists from Spain and Chile. These include a call for all Antarctic tourists and scientists to be better educated about conservation when they arrive in the region. In addition, contingency plans to deal with plant or insect invasions should be developed and better use made of scientific experts when incidents occur.※The insects and plants that are native to Antarctica have survived there for thousands of years,§ said Hodgson. ※We have got to act now if we want to save this last, pristine environment.§"																																																			
"MPs from four influential committees are coming together to launch a joint inquiry into the scale and impact of the UK＊s air pollution crisis.In an unusual development, the environmental audit committee, environment, food and rural affairs committee, health committee and transport committee will hold four sessions to consider mounting scientific evidence on the health and environmental effects of toxic air.Dr Sarah Wollaston, the health committee chair, said poor air quality was ※affecting the health of millions of people across the UK§. ※Our joint inquiry will include an examination of the scale of the harm caused and the action necessary to tackle it,§ she added.Last month, the Guardian revealed the risk to children＊s health posed by air pollution,  where pupils as young as three are exposed to illegal levels of air pollution.The government says toxic air causes 每 9,000 of them in the capital 每 and costs the country ?27.5bn each year.The government＊s own statistics show 38 out of 43 UK ※air quality zones§  and last year the high court ruled ministers must cut the illegal levels of NO2 in dozens of towns and cities because their current policies to improve air quality were so poor they were unlawful.The government has to announce its new plans before 24 April and the inquiry will examine whether these proposals go far enough to cut pollution ※not only to meet legal limits but also to deliver maximum health and environmental benefits§.Mary Creagh, chair of the environmental audit committee, said: ※The UK courts have twice found that the government has failed to deal with our air pollution problem properly. Now ministers will face unprecedented scrutiny in parliament to ensure they finally step up to the mark to ensure adults, and children in particular, do not have their health damaged by filthy air.§Much of the most dangerous pollution  and there is growing pressure on the government  to encourage people to swap polluting diesel vehicles for cleaner alternatives. Louise Ellman, chair of the transport committee, said the UK economy depends on an ※efficient and flexible transport system§ but added: ※Emissions from vehicles are a significant problem and the standards that governments have relied on have not delivered the expected reductions. We will be asking what more can be done to increase the use of cleaner vehicles as well as to encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport.§Neil Parish, chair of the environment, food and rural affairs committee, said the joint inquiry was unprecedented. ※The solutions to cleaning up our air are not the responsibility of just one minister. That＊s why we have taken the unprecedented task of convening four select committees so we can scrutinise the government＊s efforts from every angle and look for holistic solutions that are good for health, transport and the environment.§"																																																			
"s now the time to buy an electric car? Falls in financing costs mean that switching to a zero carbon-emitting vehicle won＊t just help the environment, it can be cheaper than buying and running a conventional car., the price premium for most models meant they made most financial sense to central London drivers keen to avoid the ?11.50-a-day congestion charge 每 but for other motorists the case for going electric was less obvious. However, a drop in leasing costs, plus much lower running costs, have made the financial package much more attractive.The popular Nissan Leaf, with a large 30kWh battery, can now be leased for about ?240 a month with a deposit of ?2,000. This is just ?70 a month more than the larger, petrol-engined Nissan Juke and many supermini class vehicles.When you consider that someone who uses their car to commute each day could easily be spending ?70 on petrol a month, the green option is starting to look as good for your wallet as for the environment. The cost of an overnight charge that delivers a typical 100 miles of driving is about ?3-?4 depending on your electricity tariff. To go the same distance in a petrol car would typically cost ?15 每 more if your journeys are all around town. This in part is why there are now 100,000 electric cars on UK roads, and 2m worldwide.※Once you＊ve got used to living with an electric car, most people say they＊d never go back to a conventional one. You are driving the future,§ says Melanie Shufflebotham who runs NextGreenCar, a website dedicated to low-carbon vehicles. An enthusiastic Nissan Leaf owner, she says improvements to the charging infrastructure, a greater awareness of the benefits of going electric in cities, and the fact that the technology is now proven have all allowed electric cars to move into the mainstream.※Range anxiety is largely a thing of the past. The newest Renault Zoe, with its bigger battery, now offers a range of about 180 miles from a single charge 每 more than enough for most users who drive to and from work or similar,§ Shufflebotham says. ※I wouldn＊t necessarily want to drive to Edinburgh, but I regularly drive my Leaf from Bristol to London with one fast 30-minute recharge at one of the Ecotricity charging points on the motorway network. For that I pay ?6 每 a fraction of the cost of filling a tank with petrol.§Although electric car technology is proven to be reliable, she says her website recommends that users lease their electric car as at the end of the term they can simply hand them back. If there were a breakthrough in battery technology that brought down the cost of new models, older electric car values would likely plummet.Shufflebotham says one of the things holding back electric vehicle take-up is the fact that you need a space close to the house to charge it at night. People living in terraced houses and relying upon on-street parking are currently scuppered unless they have a regular charging option at work.Lamp-post recharging points and more workplace and on-street charging options will eventually cure this, but widespread rollout will take some time. If people want electric vehicle charging points on their street they should put pressure on their local council, she says.Other points to consider are that while insurance is generally pricier, annual servicing is cheaper 每 ?99 a year is typical. There is no oil to change and any significant problems should be covered by the warranty. With a government grant, home-charging points cost about ?300 to install, while several manufacturers provide them as part of the sales package. Choose a car that allows fast charging and consider having a faster charger installed at home. It＊s also worth noting that your car＊s range will go down significantly in cold weather.So which electric cars should you go for? The Renault Zoe may have the longest range (only outdone by the hugely expensive Teslas), but they are relatively expensive and buyers have to pay at least ?59 a month to lease the battery.For the best all-round package the Nissan Leaf is hard to beat, says Shufflebotham. The BMW i3 is another to consider but is significantly more expensive 每 on lease from ?346 a month for four years with ?2,076 up front. The new Hyundai Ionic or recently updated VW e-Golf are also worth considering.Another to bear in mind is the Kia Soul EV. This all-electric Korean car is set to be a bestseller, according to Adam Kemp of Drive Electric, which specialises in electric car leasing. His firm, which currently has 1,000 electric cars out on lease, offers one for a competitive ?222 a month with ?1,332 up front. Auto Express gave the Kia Soul EV four stars when they tested it.Kemp says one thing to consider as a private buyer is whether you can persuade your employer to offer you the chance to buy the car via a salary sacrifice scheme, which can bring the cost down hugely if you are a higher rate taxpayer. The  website and app will direct you to your nearest public charging station. There are more than 4,000 locations and 12,000 points in the UK.Kerry lawyer Tim O＊Leary and family junked their gas-guzzling SUV for an all-electric Nissan Leaf.※I can confirm that owning and driving an electric car is low-cost, no-guilt driving in a car that reverses all the clich谷s.※People often ask me: ＆What happens when you run out of electricity?＊ The answer is: ＆I don＊t know because I never have.＊ Range anxiety seems to exist with people who don＊t have electric cars. Everyone who has them, like me, raves about them.※There is a gauge that tells you your available range and you quickly get used to what it can do, which is most of your driving.

"I was debating this article. Should I write about the news that just occurred, or the news that will occur soon? I chose the past event 每 flooding in Missouri, USA. I will save a soon-to-collapse portion of the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica for my next article.It＊s sad, but true, that there are mounting ironies around Trump＊s scientific ignorance on climate change and  to reduce global warming. Scientists know the Earth is warming and that humans are the cause. One consequence of the warming is that weather is becoming more extreme. This means we are getting more extreme storms, including rain and floods. As our nation and the world suffers from the extreme weather, we can reflect on how things could have been different had our politicians heeded the warnings.While President Trump＊s pulling from the Paris treaty was worldwide news, what was not covered as well was his declaration the very next day that the state of Missouri is a disaster area because of flooding. Why is flooding a symptom of warming? As air warms, it holds more moisture - it＊s more humid. As the Earth warms, it means that the atmosphere holds more moisture year round. That moisture falls during storms as rain. What＊s interesting is that the result is more of the most severe rains. That is, when it rains, it＊s raining harder. Consequently, more flooding occurs. And we are seeing that across our nation. If you look at the trends in the most severe downpours, they are increasing 每 everywhere.One example are the recent floods in Missouri, which occurred during the month of May. On or around May 24, 2017, the Missouri governor  for 45 counties in the state. The president granted the aid on June 2. The federal aid will help the state recover from approximately $28 million in residential losses and $58 million in municipal damage. Images from the flood have been widely  for people to witness the disaster. This flood isn＊t a single event. There has been much recent reporting on other floods in Missouri and elsewhere throughout 2015 and 2016. For instance,  describes flooding in August 2016 and the  in 2015, which killed at least 13 people. The kinds of extreme weather we are seeing now will continue to get worse and cause far more damage in the future. This is but the tip of the iceberg.Fortunately, there is something we can do about it. The two most important steps are mitigation and adaptation. We should mitigate against future climate change by quickly reducing our carbon pollution. We can accomplish this by using our energy more wisely and by increasing our generation of power from clean, renewable, sources. Secondly, we should start to plan the infrastructure of the future to handle more extreme storms and weather. Flood control systems, sea walls, robust electrical grids, etc. These can go a long way reducing the damage when extreme weather occurs. But, it isn＊t clear we will have such foresight. Not only do we have a president who is on a warpath to destroy our mitigation and adaptation efforts, but he is aided by people within states like Missouri. For instance, Missouri Senator Roy Blunt is a well-known denier of human-caused climate change. :Say what? Missouri Representative Jason Smith :Huh? What is a climate change agenda? Missouri Representative Vicky Hartzler :A remnant organization of the prior USA president, Organizing for Action, also lists some of the most well known deniers and climate impacts on their states. For Missouri, it isn＊t just the most recent years of flooding; the disasters have piled up for a while. For instance, as :A large list of some of the most well-known deniers are provided  so readers can find out who to thank when weather 每 pumped up by human warming 每 comes to their neighborhood. So, will people put 2 and 2 together as they pick up the pieces of their lives and homes? Will they think about the irony that the people they elected have helped blocked our efforts to reduce the very floods that destroyed their communities? I think they will. I think the collective legacy of the extreme weather and its impacts on our communities will be a told repeatedly by future generations."																																																			
"Damian Carrington is half right (, 13 February) in that cities bear a terrible burden from air pollution and municipal action is critical to address it. However, city governments cannot succeed alone. Much of urban pollution stems from outside city limits and significant progress will only be achieved with policies that also require national, regional and even international commitment.A significant part of city air pollution drifts in from regional sources like wood-burning rural households, coal-fired power plants, industries and the open burning of agricultural waste and rubbish. Commuters driving in from car-centric suburbs and transport between cities contribute to urban congestion and pollution too, stymying smart city initiatives like investments in public transportation and safer streets for walking and cycling.We know what works. Cities must enact new policies like those mentioned. But, as important, national and state governments must ensure access to clean household energy and enforce limits on emissions from power stations, industry, open burning and other sources. Policies are also needed to support regional public transit, set standards for low vehicle emissions and low sulphur content in petrol and diesel. Until then, a large part of the air quality 每 and health 每 of cities will be at the mercy of their neighbours and the wind that carries their pollution. Air pollution is not just a London problem (, 17 February). Of the 43 zones currently monitored in the UK, 38 fail EU standards for NO2, so any strategy has to be nationwide and not left to individual councils.The most likely government response is an extension of clean air zones, but there are serious doubts as to whether this will improve public health. First, designating certain areas as clean does nothing to reduce total emissions; it merely diverts them elsewhere. Second, the health effects of NO2 and particulates are without threshold, so reducing levels below an arbitrary limit may make sense politically, but will have little effect biologically. Third, the projected improvement in air quality is predicated upon new vehicles producing less NO2 in line with stricter EU vehicle emission tests, but we already know that emissions of NO2 ※on the road§ are four to five times greater than in laboratory tests, a discrepancy that even applies to the latest Euro 6 engines. Finally, studies of London schoolchildren showed no improvement in lung function after three years living in a low-emission zone.As your leader proposes, we are in urgent need of a new Clean Air Act that hastens the demise of diesel and other highly polluting technologies, something the government could and should have championed more than 20 years ago."																																																			
"The most senior career diplomat at the US embassy in China has stepped down, amid reports that he opposes the Trump administration＊s decision to quit the .  David Rank, a 27-year veteran state department officer, was appointed to serve as charg谷 d＊affaires in Beijing in January last year. A state department spokeswoman confirmed Rank＊s departure but said she was unable to confirm reports that he resigned as he felt unable to deliver a formal notification to  of the US decision last week to quit the agreement. ※He has retired from the foreign service,§ said Anna Richey-Allen, a spokeswoman for the department＊s East Asia bureau. ※Mr Rank has made a personal decision. We appreciate his years of dedicated service to the state department.§ Iowa governor Terry Branstad, Donald Trump＊s pick as the next US ambassador to Beijing, is expected to take up the post later this month.A tweet from the China expert John Pomfret quoted unnamed sources as saying that Rank had resigned as he could not support Trump＊s decision last week to withdraw from the Paris agreement.In another tweet, Pomfret said Rank called a town hall meeting to announce his decision to embassy staff and explained that he could not deliver a diplomatic note informing the Chinese government of the US decision.A senior US official confirmed the account given in the tweets but added that after Rank announced his intention to retire on Monday in Beijing, he was told by the state department to leave his post immediately. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Rank, a career foreign service officer who took over the post of deputy chief of mission in Beijing in January 2016, could not immediately be reached for comment. Jonathan Fritz, the embassy＊s economics councillor, would serve as charg谷 in his place, Richey-Allen said. Trump＊s announcement last Thursday that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, saying the agreement would undermine the US economy and cost jobs, drew anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry."																																																			
"ast Sunday evening, the air over London achieved a remarkable quality. As winds died and a freezing stillness gripped the city, levels of nitrogen oxides and particles of soot slowly built up in the air until they reached maximum measurable levels at 24 different locations across the capital. It was a degree of pollution that had never been recorded in London since the government introduced its current methods and scales for recording air quality, the , in 2012.※What we recorded was a very intense pollution event over London 每 in common with several other areas of western Europe,§ said air pollution expert Gary Fuller, of King＊s College . ※We had not seen anything like it here for the past five years.§When level 10 degree of pollution is reached, men, women and children with lung problems, adults with heart conditions, and older people are all advised to avoid strenuous physical activity, while asthma sufferers are told to use their reliever inhaler more often. This was the grim scenario that was repeated at 24 locations across the city, from Swiss Cottage to Mitcham and from Teddington to Dagenham.But what was striking was not just the extent and severity of pollution but its timing. Sunday night is a period when the city＊s normally hectic traffic reaches its lowest ebb. People stay at home to watch television or wander to the pub. Generally, they leave their cars untouched.Yet, the optical and mass spectrometers used by Fuller and his team indicated that levels of pollution that are normally linked to vehicle emissions had reached an unprecedented high. How could low traffic volumes be associated with air pollution that is usually linked to revving cars and motorbikes?Fuller believes several factors were involved 每 though his instruments indicate the involvement of one quite specific phenomenon that recently emerged as a villain threatening the air we breathe: the .※One clear factor we could see through our measurements was that high levels of pollution were coming from wood-burning stoves,§ he said. ※They produce particulates that have a distinctive colour and spectroscopic signature that we can pick up very accurately in our machines. And of course, a cold weekend evening is the time when most people with wood-burning stoves like to sit in front of them to keep themselves nice and cosy. We could see that in the impact they had on the air of London last Sunday.§The emergence of  每 not just in London but across the nation 每 has produced a spate of headlines suggesting their growing use is likely to trigger the return of ※pea-soup§ fogs, which will kill of tens of thousands of individuals, with children and the elderly on the front line.However, this is an extreme scenario and few scientists believe it is likely to materialise in the near future even at the present rate of the stoves＊ growing popularity. An illustration is provided by studies by Fuller and others. These have shown that the monthly contribution of wood-burning stoves to particulate levels in the air varies from a maximum of around 10% in January down to 2% in August. But these figures are several years old and it is not clear by how much the use of stoves is increasing. Nevertheless, from this baseline it is clear that wood-burning would have to rise by a vast amount to bring back pea-soup fogs to London.Even so, the wood stove controversy reveals the growing fears that many have about changes that affect the air we breath. Many believe its quality is being compromised and is declining. But is this true? Is the atmosphere changing dangerously and if so, what do we need to do to stop this?A look at last week＊s pollution provides some clues 每 other factors were involved in London＊s atmospheric woes this winter. One couldn＊t be more simple: the weather. ※Meteorological conditions have been stagnant for several weeks,§ said Martyn Chipperfield, professor of atmospheric chemistry at Leeds University. ※There has been a stable, blocking anticyclone resting over Britain and that has trapped air over the country. There has been nothing to blow the pollution away. Worse, any winds that we have had have come from the south east, from Europe where the air is already polluted. Our prevailing winds usually blow in from the Atlantic bringing in fairly fresh air. Instead, all we have had is the odd puff of already polluted air.§In addition, there is the particular geography of London, which leaves it badly exposed to fogs and pollution. The city nestles in land that is surrounded by hills and air gets trapped in this basin, particularly when wind flow is low and temperature inversions occur. Add to this, the high levels of vehicle use in its thoroughfares and you have a recipe for grim pollution.An illustration is provided by the district of Brixton in south London. A major north-south thoroughfare runs past its houses and bars and restaurants. Brixton is also relatively low-lying 每 to the detriment of its air quality. According to last week＊s , pollution on Brixton Road exceeded World Health Organisation guidelines for exposure to nitrogen oxides on 21 occasions on just one day this year, 5 January. The district has the worst air pollution in London, it is claimed by campaigners 每 with some urging that outdoor food and drink sales be stopped when air pollution levels are at their worst. As mayor Sadiq Khan has put it: ※ 每 may need to take precautions to protect themselves from the filthy air.§London＊s problems have led civic leaders to advocate a host of anti-pollution measures, the latest being plans to change parking regulations to make it more expensive for owners of cars with diesel engines to park in the city. (Almost half the city＊s nitrogen oxide pollution comes from diesel vehicles, it is claimed.) It remains to be seen how effective such measures will be.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has fixed the year 2025 as the date London has to meet EU air-quality standards. King＊s College London＊s researchers suggest that 2030 is a more likely date. That is a long time to wait before the city gets its environmental act in order.However, it should be noted that, compared to many other cities, London＊s pollution problems are mild. Three months ago, Delhi was swathed in a thick carpet of fog that persisted for weeks and which is believed to have been triggered 每 at least in part 每 by the setting-off of fireworks during India＊s Diwali celebrations in October.Last week, officials in Beijing urged residents to refrain from setting off fireworks for the Lunar new year celebrations. This follows the decision by Henan province to ban the practice to limit the  By those standards, London＊s problems are mild.For good measure, it should also be noted that both nitrogen oxide emissions and particulate emissions have declined steadily from 1990 to 2014, the most recent year for which figures are available. Improvements in diesel engine technology have made a difference though confidence in statistics in this area has been dented by the  每 in which the company was revealed to have deceived regulators about the real level of nitrogen oxide emissions from its cars.※The particular concern we have today are the oxides of nitrogen that are generated - in power stations and in cars and other petrol-burning vehicles,§ said Chipperfield. ※It is not clear if climate change will lead to the arrival in Britain of more of the blocking anticyclones that have caused so many of our recent problems. Last year our weather problems were caused by storms, after all. On the other hand, this sort of thing is not going to disappear.§Campaign groups have claimed that thousands of people die every year because of elevated levels of particulates and nitrogen oxides in our atmosphere. Yet nitrogen oxides are not particularly dangerous and can be given in fairly high doses to men and women without serious effects, said Anthony Frew, professor of allergy and respiratory medicine, at the Royal Sussex County Hospital.※We have done experiments in which healthy people inhaled air in which nitrogen oxides were at levels that were far higher than those you get in polluted cities and found that it does not do anything,§ said Frew. ※However, for people with asthma and other conditions like that, it is harmful.§Nitrogen oxides are also believed to affect white blood cells and prevent them operating at maximum efficiency, thus leaving them more likely to succumb to certain infectious diseases. In addition, it has been found that soot particles in the atmosphere are linked to cardiac disease.What causes the real controversy is the manner in which health statistics have been used to bolster the notion that air pollution is deadly. One example is the the use of the statistic that in 2008, around 40,000 early deaths were caused by nitrogen oxides and particulates in the atmosphere in Britain. Over time, this figure has been misused to suggest that 40,000 deaths 每 as opposed to early deaths 每 were linked to air pollution. That simply is not true, said Frew. ※It is untrue to say that 40,000 people died from air pollution. What is happening is that a lot of people are dying slightly sooner than they would if there was no air pollution.§In addition, the concept of early death is vague, he added. ※One teenager killed at the age of 17 represents an average of about 70 life years lost. Equally, 840 people losing one month at the end of their lives is also 70 life years lost but society would usually put more value on the life lost at 17 than the 840 slightly shortened lives, even though the life-years lost are the same.§However, it is the latter statistic that is the most realistic version of what is happening. This is no excuse for inaction, argue scientists like Frew. Britain needs to reduce its nitrogen oxides and particulates levels to agreed EU limits and to a tight timetable. But this needs to be done calmly, with a sense of perspective."																																																			
"ondoners are being warned not to breathe too deeply when they go outside. A , threatening the health and wellbeing of the capital. It is small consolation to know that this has been the state of the city＊s air for more than 200 years. is in a natural basin surrounded by hills and its air generally holds moisture because of the river running through it, so it has always had a natural fog problem.Then came the industrial revolution, with coal fires powering steam-driven factory machines and being used to heat homes. As the city＊s industry and population grew apace from the 1820s onwards, smoke mixed with the moist air and on cold days produced a particularly nasty, thick, yellow, sulphurous atmosphere that became trapped in London＊s narrow roads and alleyways. People knew from early on that the smog could kill and there were many calls to clean up London＊s air.Many politicians took up the cause but they were generally isolated or maverick figures. It was the mustachioed Conservative MP Gerald Nabarro who turned the tide after  killed around 12,000 people. He forced through the 1956 Clean Air Act despite government reluctance. (Although a recent episode of TV drama  presented Winston Churchill as the obstacle to change, it was actually the chancellor, Harold Macmillan.)Why did it take so long? Industrial interests often prevailed. To move to cleaner fuels always meant higher costs and successive governments were reluctant to interfere with the right of domestic consumers to use the fuel they preferred.  extolled the virtues of the ※old-fashioned coal fire§ and complained of ※the noisy minority§ who wanted to do away with it. It was only when gas and electricity became more affordable that legislation could be passed without incurring higher costs to the consumers.Londoners were also proud of their smogs. Industrial chimneys pumping out smoke signified employment. A coal fire blazing in the hearth meant warmth and comfort. London fog was given a variety of romantic names such as ※London ivy§ by Charles Dickens or the ※pea-souper§, not the green variety but the more traditional yellow potage.Writers perceived the magic and mystery of London fog and used it extensively. Dickens employed it in the opening pages of  to signify the obfuscations of the Court of Chancery. The air, he wrote, had ※flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes§. Henry James, George Gissing, Robert Louis Stevenson and Joseph Conrad also used London fog in their works.Pulp-fiction writers liked to use smog as a means of totally destroying life in London: ※One common doom, one common sepulchre of gloomy fog, there was for the richest and the poorest, the best and the worst alike,§ wrote one writer of these apocalyptic stories.Visitors to the city complained if they did not experience the famous London fog. Foreign artists saw its potential and came over to paint it.Impressionist painter  booked a room on the top floor of the Savoy hotel in the winter and produced a series of beautiful London fog paintings around the turn of the 19th century.He ※was terrified to see that there was no fog, not even the least trace of a mist§ as a clear atmosphere frustrated his search for the effect. A Japanese artist, Yoshio Markino, travelled to London to paint the fog, observing that ※the harmony of its colour is most wonderful§.Of course, people also made a connection between fog, mystery and crime. On film and on TV, Sherlock Holmes is often seen combing for clues through foggy streets. In fact, his creator, Arthur Conan Doyle, did not use London fog as extensively in his writings as people think. It only plays an active role in one of his stories, , where the villain needs to dispose of a dead body out of a window on to the top of a train without being seen.Jack the Ripper is often dramatised as pursuing his victims through the fog, but in fact his crimes took place on clear nights.Will the toxic fog Londoners are now experiencing be seen as anything other than what it really is 每 a dangerous, poisonous nuisance? It is much harder to romanticise now than the pea-soupers of the past. Nowadays, too, cleaner technology is available with electric cars as well as less polluting fuels for industry.In Victorian times it was our love for home fires that politicians were reluctant to upset; today it is our love for cars and other private means of transport. It took many decades to act on the knowledge that pea-soupers cost lives. How many decades will it take in our own time?"																																																			
"It might be tempting to dismiss the  crisis that affected London last week as a piece of local bad luck, an atmospheric misfortune that has little consequence for the rest of the nation. With a stable, blocking anticyclone coming to rest over southern England, a dense slab of freezing air was trapped above the capital. As a consequence, increasing amounts of nitrogen oxides and soot particles, generated by diesel engines and, to a lesser extent, wood-burning stoves, were held in the air over London until they reached their maximum measurable levels in the atmosphere at 24 sites across the city last Sunday. The result was a bad air day for London.People with heart and lung disease were cautioned to avoid strenuous exercise while asthma sufferers were warned to use their inhalers more frequently. By contrast, the level of pollution in the rest of the country was considerably lower. The whole business was simply London＊s tough luck, you might conclude.Such parochialism would be misplaced, however. London has always been the country＊s bellwether when it comes to air quality, as the  has noted. After all, it was the city＊s deadly pea-soup fogs of the 1950s that forced the government to the pass the Clean Air Act 1956, a piece of legislation that limited the burning of coal in cities and brought major benefits to the whole country. The air we breathe today across Britain is markedly fresher and healthier than it was 60 years ago, thanks to the lessons learned in London at the time.These improvements should not be taken for granted, however. Our air is still under threat, though from a different source. Once it was coal burning. Today emissions from cars, particularly those with diesel engines, account for much of the pollution that affects our air and the hazard affects the whole nation.However, it is concentrated 每 to a striking degree 每 in London because the capital has an economy that is heavily reliant on motorised transport. It also possesses a rapidly increasing population density and, for good measure, has an ageing infrastructure. It is a triple whammy that presents civic leaders with serious headaches when trying to improve London＊s air. The government has fixed 2025 as the year when London should meet its legal  that it agreed with Europe and so reduce its soot particle and nitrogen oxide emissions to acceptable levels. So difficult are the issues facing a city in which delivery vehicles are in constant movement and building sites have pumps and generators in continual use for days on end that most experts doubt if they will succeed until 2030 or even later.Easing London＊s air pollution is clearly going to be a tricky business but the task is certainly worth pursuing, not just for the sake of its own citizens but for the nation in general. The argument is straightforward. If air pollution can successfully be tackled in , where conditions are worst, then it can be vanquished anywhere else in the country. In other words, if we can clean up London＊s air, the rest of the nation will have nothing to worry about.That is why we should take the air pollution problems of our capital seriously and that is why the city＊s major, , is to be congratulated for tackling the issue in a comprehensive manner, in particular by promising to protect London＊s schools and the city＊s children from the worst impacts of car exhaust emissions. A range of measures is now being considered to limit emissions in London. These include the introduction of higher parking charges for vehicles with diesel engines, introducing ultra-low-emission zones within the M25 and imposing fines for those who leave engines idling near schools.As we have noted in our report on city smog, air pollution has no respect for borders. Polluted winds from France and Spain frequently blow into Britain, for example. In turn, our exhaust emissions are often swept towards Denmark, such is the nature of the weather patterns of western Europe. We cannot then be certain we will always be able to curtail air pollution to a fixed minimum. There will always be external forces at play. This is no excuse for inaction, however. These factors merely underscore the importance of Britain doing everything it can to ensure that air pollution is kept to an absolute minimum and in a state that ensures its inhabitants have the best possible opportunity to live healthy lives."																																																			
"Westminster will become the first council in the UK to charge drivers of diesel cars extra money to park as town halls across  battle air pollution.The charge will be introduced for a trial period from April. Drivers of diesel-powered cars and vans will pay an additional 50%, which at current rates would be an extra ?2.45 an hour to park on the street in Marylebone, one of the most polluted areas of the borough. Vehicle emissions, particularly diesel fumes, are an increasingly pervasive problem in the capital, which  just five days into 2017. A cold snap with very still air, dense traffic and the popularity of wood-burning stoves combined to push London into a ※§ alert for air pollution this week, with scientists reporting the highest levels of particulates in the atmosphere in six years. The alert prompted the London mayor, , to criticise the ※shameful state of London＊s toxic air§ and called on the government to do more.Cllr David Harvey, the Westminster city council cabinet member for the environment, sports and community, said: ※Residents and visitors tell us all the time that air quality is a key concern in central London and we have consulted with our partners and local stakeholders on this practical step in improving our health and wellbeing.※Additional charges for  will mean people think twice about using highly polluting cars and invest in cleaner transport that will make a real difference in the quality of air we breathe and our environment.§Westminster city council says the extra money raised through the trial of the ※polluter pays§ parking scheme will be spent on boosting . If the scheme succeeds in changing people＊s behaviour it could be rolled out to other parts of the borough, the council said. The initiative is just one of the ways boroughs are trying to tackle what one local official described as a ※public health emergency§, which has regularly seen the air quality in London breach legal limits.  and the mayor＊s office are spending ?13m on projects aimed at encouraging people to switch to . Khan said last month that air pollution kills nearly 10,000 Londoners a year. He announced plans to spend more than ?875m on improving air quality in the capital, more than doubling the amount pledged by his predecessor . Khan is considering introducing additional charges for the oldest and most polluting vehicles, and plans to introduce an  a year earlier than previously intended. This week Hackney council announced it would be banning parking of any non-electric cars from several streets bordering the City financial district, again as part of efforts to tackle air pollution. The council will spend ?1m, provided by the mayor＊s office and TfL＊s pro-electric cars fund, on installing  on the streets. Hackney＊s deputy mayor, Shirley Rodrigues, said: ※Tackling London＊s poor air quality is a public health emergency that requires bold action at all levels of government. These six innovative schemes will play a direct role cleaning up the toxic air in neighbourhoods across London, and could lead the way for similar schemes across the UK.§"

"The UK is second only to Italy in Europe for the highest number of annual deaths from a major air pollutant, a report has found just days after  for drawing up a stronger air quality plan.The  the UK had 11,940 premature deaths in 2013 from nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a toxic gas mostly caused by diesel vehicles and linked to lung problems. The number is down from 14,100 in 2012, but still the second worst in Europe. The agency also revealed that the UK is home to the worst NO2 hotspot in Europe.

The UK government should be ashamed of these figures and must act now to protect the health of people in this country.§Italy and UK both a similar proportion of diesel cars, but the NO2 problem in Italy is also compounded by industrial sources of the pollutant in urban and suburban areas, experts at the EEA said.Across Europe, the EEA estimated that 71,000 people died prematurely in 2013 because of NO2 pollution. While the pollutant has been on a downward trend since the turn of the century because of stricter diesel car standards, more than one in 10 monitoring stations in  still breach NO2 limits, the agency found.Hans Bruyninckx, the EEA＊s executive director, said: ※Emission reductions have led to improvements in air quality in Europe, but not enough to avoid unacceptable damage to human health and the environment.§The report comes as MEPs in the European parliament on Wednesday arpproved caps for five air pollutants, including NO2, to come into force in 2030. The new national emissions ceilings rules are expected to halve the number of deaths from air pollution. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP, said: ※If I had become a doctor instead of a politician I would be prescribing a serious health warning to the UK government today.

"onald Trump doesn＊t give much thought to his legacy because he has little interest in living outside the blinding present. Ideas and impulses come and go, defining national policy, rendering past and future meaningless. Now the world trembles as this erratic president mulls whether to  that may determine the course of the century.If Trump moves to withdraw from the , as he once vowed to do as a candidate, he would successfully undercut global efforts to avert a coming catastrophe. As the world＊s largest economy and second largest greenhouse gas polluter, the US cannot unilaterally destroy the 195-nation pact, but it can encourage other nations more skeptical of the deal, such as India and the Philippines, to follow suit. The goals of the agreement 每 to lower planet-warming emissions enough to mitigate the extreme heat, massive storms and coastal flooding projected for the coming decades 每 will be even harder to reach.  Trump is a climate change skeptic, a severe outlier on the world stage but . Democrats, beset with their own challenges and hypocrisies, at least understand that climate change poses an existential threat. This is not like Trump hemming and hawing over pulling out of Nato, a military alliance that is not required to protect the stability of human civilization. This is much worse.  But these are not terms Trump thinks in. Despite fancying himself as some kind of master builder, he has only shown himself to be a dismantler, a destroyer. His proposed budget , many of whom voted for him. His obsession with repealing Obamacare, which no longer consumes most rank-and-file Republicans now that Barack Obama has left office, will only  and ensure the suffering of the oldest, sickest and the poorest. A true populist, even one disdainful of democratic institutions, would at least try to protect the economic safety net that saves the very people who put him in office. Not so with Trump. Maybe the most galling aspect of this new American order is the lack of any organizing philosophy, a workable plan to replace the things he wishes to dismantle. Like a toddler at play time, he smashes things and refuses to clean up. His building blocks are left on the mat. What could be gained from pulling America out of the Paris agreement or introducing new caveats? Will a few more Trump voters cheer on their man for staying true to his insanity? Maybe. But if the cult of Trump has proven one thing, it＊s that it＊s forgiving of inconsistencies. It will remain intact whether the strongman swings left or right. It will be there for him if he decides to reaffirm America＊s commitment to guarding the health of the planet. To the people who voted for Trump in coal country, environmentalists will always be the sworn enemy, even if it＊s ruthless corporate titans, technological automation and the decline of unions which have doomed them. Trump＊s happy to keep that canard alive. And he＊s just as happy to offer them nothing else. Most politicians have a conception of what their utopia might look like, or at least advance ideas or policies towards building a world they＊d like to see. Trump, ever more willing to co-opt the nihilism of his party＊s most rightwing flank, has no use for seriously investing in his country or the world＊s environmental sustainability. That would force him to think deeply about the future. And everyone knows he doesn＊t make time for that. "																																																			
"If there is one point (writes a correspondent) upon which it might have been supposed that we were all agreed, it is the unwholesomeness and unhealthiness of foggy weather. In broad daylight nothing looks much clearer or more conclusive than the evidence now and again put forth from the office of the Registrar General on the subject.According to that, persistent fogs have been known to raise the death-rate from 22 to 48 per 1,000. But we have also before us facts and figures accumulated by a very able scientific observer who seems to make it as clear as Lord Mayor＊s Day that fog is conducive to health and the prolongation of life. He admits that a fog-laden atmosphere is bad for certain ailments 每 rheumatism, for instance, 每 but he contends that it is good for the lungs, and in support of this opinion he points to the indisputable efficacy of the bronchitis kettle, which is merely a device for maintaining a dry atmosphere. He gives tables of statistics which seem to show that lung diseases prevail in almost precisely inverse ratio to the dampness of the atmosphere. Even this philosopher, however, stipulates for fog pure and simple. It is quite another matter of course if it is laden with sulphurous smoke.The next authority, one so generally respected as the ※Lancet,§ makes light even of the sulphur. There is no special cause of uneasiness as to the sulphur fogs, said the ※Lancet,§ in commenting on Mr. John Aitken＊s theories. ※On the whole they are blessings in thick disguise.§ Yet another scientist gravely questions the peculiar injuriousness of smoke, in a fog, whatever may be its components. It is not the smoke that does the mischief, he says; it is the cold moisture that gets into the breathing passages of delicate lungs and occasions chill and irritation. Another makes little of smoke or sulphur, moisture or cold. He points out the obvious truth that if the lungs are partly filled with watery vapour, as they must be in a fog, they cannot contain so much vitalising oxygen as they otherwise would, and the whole system is depressed and enfeebled for want of it. Such is the darkening of counsel in this matter. All theorists alike, however, seem to agree in treating fog as a late outcome of modern ways of life. But this view does not bear examination. The ancients were quite familiar with fogs of all sorts and colours. When Thetis rose out of the sea to console Achilles she was enveloped in silvery mist, and in Apollonius Rhodius broad daylight was suddenly overcast and the Argonauts were shut in a black fog from which they were only extricated by Apollo, who came down and held up his shining bow very much in the manner of a London ling-boy. No doubt the industrial chimney has besooted the fog, but it certainly has not created it nor very materially intensified it. Fogs in London have indeed for many years past, for some reason or other, been undergoing reformation. As to the general estimation of fog, there are some, it is said, who rejoice in a mystery they perceive in it and in its effect on architecture when it is not too thick; but into this we need not enter at the present."																																																			
"It＊s now ※inevitable§ that the contiguous United States will lose all of its glaciers within a matter of decades, according to scientists who have revealed the precipitous shrinkage of dozens of glaciers in .Warming temperatures have rapidly reduced the size of 39 named glaciers in Montana since 1966, according to  by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Portland State University. Some have lost as much as 85% of their expanse over the past 50 years, with Glacier national park, site of 37 of the surveyed glaciers, set to lose all of its eponymous ice formations within the next few decades. Of the 150 glaciers that existed in the park in the late 19th century, only 26 remain.The disappearance of glaciers in Montana is  that will see all glaciers, defined as moving bodies of snow and ice larger than 25 acres, largely vanish from the lower 48 states of America by the mid point of the century, according to Dr Daniel Farge, lead USGS scientist.※It＊s inevitable that we will lose them all over the next few decades,§ Farge said. ※The Colorado glaciers started melting before Montana＊s and while there are larger glaciers in the Pacific north-west that will hold on longer, the number vanishing will steadily grow until none are left.§Andrew Fountain, a geologist at Portland State, added: ※While the shrinkage in Montana is more severe than some other places in the US, it is in line with trends that have been happening on a global scale.§ 每 Montana is warming nearly twice as quickly as the global average 每 and changes in precipitation patterns are eroding away glaciers in the state and elsewhere along the Rocky mountains. Last year, scientists in Colorado  that the Arikaree glacier, which is likely more than 1,000 years old, has been thinning by around a metre (3.2ft) a year over the past decade and will vanish within 25 years.Warming winters are bringing more rain, rather than glacier-forming snow, to Montana and other states. Even when there is plenty of snow, as Montana experienced this winter, the increasing heat of spring and summer is melting it away more quickly. Spring snow melts are now occurring at least two weeks earlier than they were in the 1960s.Scientists analyzed the extent of the 39 Montanan glaciers by studying aerial and satellite imagery stretching back to 1966. The latest data, from 2015, shows that there are now just 26 glaciers larger than 25 acres. The largest, Harrison glacier, is now 410 acres 每 a 19% decrease over the past 50 years. Others have declined by up to 85%. have been in this stretch of the northern Rockies for around 7,000 years and the study of tree ring data and piles of rocks left behind by shifting glaciers show there were around 150 of the ice formations in the Glacier national park area in 1850. Most have now disappeared.Farge said glaciers started to shrink from around 1910 and then entered ※rapid and continual§ melting from the 1970s onwards. The environmental conditions now experienced in the region are a marked departure from historical norms.※The glaciers have waxed and waned with different climate fluctuations but this is the first time they are heading for almost certain extinction,§ Farge said.※This is the first time in 7,000 years they＊ve experienced this temperature and precipitation. There＊s no hope for them to survive. We＊d need a major reversal where it would get cooler, not just stop getting warmer. There＊s nothing to suggest that will happen.§Farge said the decline of the glaciers outlined in the research is probably conservative as it focuses upon the extent of the glaciers, not the volume. Thinning glacier ice may cover a reasonable area but is particularly vulnerable to further warming and melting.Last year, 2.9m people visited Glacier national park. Future tourists will be confronted by a vista devoid of glaciers, a loss that Farge said will be ※poignant§.※We hope that loss contributes towards a dialogue about what to do about it,§ he said. ※It＊s important that the data is out there and is being discussed.§According to , the world＊s glaciers have lost around 400bn tons of ice per year since 1994, a decline that has impacted wildlife, increased wildfire risk in places and contributed to rapid sea level rise."																																																			
"t is a sign of the British political world＊s current priorities that Theresa May has finally . She promised it was a decision for ※§, both of which may be scarcer in the post-Brexit era in which the new runway will come into service. Pumping hope into the economy is now considered worth alienating every Conservative council and MP whose voters live under the flightpath of planes using the new runway, including Mrs May＊s own Maidenhead constituents. It is worth at least  (and maybe a lost byelection) and a novel reinterpretation of the convention about cabinet responsibility in order to accommodate public dissent from at least two ministers. It is worth what will probably be millions of pounds fighting legal challenges over air and noise pollution. Most of all, the decision puts old-fashioned economics firmly ahead of tackling climate change, which turned out not to be worth a single mention in  to MPs.The decision, which has now to be incorporated into  that MPs will vote on some time in the next 18 months, comes heavily gilded with incentives to local residents to take the money and keep quiet. About 750 homes will be subject to compulsory purchase: ?1.5bn has been set aside to pay compensation at the market rate for the unblighted value of each home and for the resettlement costs of the residents. At least another ?1bn will be paid out for noise insulation in schools and improvements in public facilities. There?will be a new community resource fund. Mr?Grayling promised MPs that there would be a 50% increase in travellers arriving at Heathrow by public transport, and the cost of improving road access would fall not to the taxpayer but to the developers. The??17bn bill for development is to be picked up by the developers and not passed on to air passengers. A senior retired judge has been appointed to oversee the consultation period.?※This is not expansion at any cost, but the right scheme at the right price,§ Mr?Grayling declared.There are many flaws in the government case which a determined opposition will unpick between now and the next general election in 2020. Campaigners, including the foreign secretary Boris Johnson, already plan to make it a central issue. This is the decision of a government that is not prepared to think boldly about the implications of its commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 80% over the next 35 years. Instead, a huge investment will be made in promoting leisure travel (which already accounts for almost two-thirds of journeys in and out of Heathrow) in the name of facilitating business connections.Thousands of jobs will be created 每 but they will mainly be for baggage handlers and baristas. Mr Grayling made a commitment to at least six new domestic destinations to enhance UK-wide connectivity, a questionable decision if the government review of HS2, the high speed train that will one day link Glasgow and Edinburgh to London, gives the project the go-ahead. If, on the other hand, HS2 is vetoed, the pressure for more highly polluting short-haul flights will only grow. Expanding air travel will make it harder than ever to cut carbon emissions to meet the targets set out in the . Air pollution has an even more immediate effect on the health of the local population. The area around Heathrow already regularly breaches safe levels of nitrogen dioxide and, with expansion, will continue to do so up until 2030. Local councils are threatening a legal challenge on those grounds alone. The lobbying organisation ClientEarth has just taken the government back to court for failing to obey an earlier injunction to produce a national plan for tackling pollution.The scale of an opposition that has been years in preparation may be enough to stall plans altogether. Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park who has resigned over the go-ahead, warned Mr Grayling that his plan was doomed. He ought to be right. This is a short-sighted investment that may provide a boost to the economy 每 a?mere ?60bn over 60 years 每 at the cost of long-term harm to globally critical climate change objectives. This is no way to run an economy that works for everyone: more flights and greater connectivity will benefit only those who can afford to travel. Those who can＊t will?gain nothing, not so much as a?single airline meal."																																																			
"magine a city street filled with two-seater electric vehicles (EVs) zipping around. A Swedish startup claims these smaller, lighter EVs could help cut congestion and toxic levels of air pollution.Uniti, which crowdfunded 1.2m (?1m) to develop the prototype of its EV, has already managed to capture the attention of Siemens. The two companies recently announced a partnership which will allow the car＊s entire production process to be planned in a virtual setting before implementing it in the real world.The ultimate goal is to produce around 50,000 cars per year in a fully automated production facility in Sweden, with the first deliveries scheduled for 2019 and expected to cost ?17,500 each 每 a figure that is likely to limit its success.The Renault Twizy, another micro EV that costs ?6,995 (excluding the monthly ?45 battery hire charge), has sold 19,589 units since its launch in 2012.※Mostly they are too expensive,§ says Dr Peter Harrop, chair of IDTechEx and co-author of a  on the micro EV market. ※But China and Taiwan will get the price down, and others are adding innovation to make them more attractive.§ Micro EVs are much smaller and lighter than standard EVs like the Chevrolet Bolt, Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf. Uniti, for example, weighs 400kg and comes with a 11 or 20 kWh battery. However, standard EVs＊ bigger batteries allow for longer ranges; the entry-level Tesla Model S 60, which costs from ?66,500, can manage just over 200 miles between charges, compared to an estimated 93 miles for Uniti＊s two-seater EV.Nevertheless, Uniti＊s range is ideal for city driving, says Lewis Horne, the company＊s CEO. He feels the smaller battery, compact size and carbon fibre and bio-composite body also make it more environmentally friendly than EVs that cleave to traditional car designs.※If we make electric cars in the exact same way we＊ve made cars for the last hundred years 每 big steel frame structure, remove the combustion engine and replace it with an oversized and overpowered electric powertrain 每 that＊s problematic,§ he says. ※A 90 kWh lithium iron battery that＊s used to carry around one human occupant is not sustainable.§As well as the Twizy and standard EVs, Uniti faces competition from the , an upcoming EV with integrated solar cells that can recharge its battery from the sun, and the , a two-seater micro EV with a top speed of 25 mph, which is due to launch in January 2018 for around ?8,000.Eli, the startup behind the car, envisions a future where low speed personal vehicles are used for central travel within cities, and high speed autonomous car-sharing services cater for journeys over longer distances.Shaina Denny, head of marketing at Eli, says the Smart car, which launched in 1998, has helped pave the way for micro EVs. ※When Smart came along, they spent millions of marketing dollars showing people that they can accept a small car, and [...] people are now a lot more open minded than they were even a few years ago.§Although Tesla has shown that it＊s possible for a new company to shake up the car industry, Tim Schwanen, director of the Transport Studies Unit at the University of Oxford, believes micro EV startups like Uniti and Eli still face a tough road ahead.※The car industry [...] is a sector that has extremely high entry barriers. It＊s very difficult for new entrants to gain a foothold,§ he says, adding that big players like Nissan and Renault ※have a whole apparatus of marketing, distribution, maintenance and expertise behind them that these new companies really lack§.That might explain why the micro EV market has already experienced at least one false start 每 MIT＊s CityCar, selected as one of the best inventions of 2007 by Time magazine, . In the long-run, says Schwanen, ※popularisation of these micro EVs will depend to a substantial degree on the role of policy§. Governments could introduce parking exemptions to encourage people to purchase one, for example, though he feels the vehicles may be better suited to car sharing schemes and private fleets than individual ownership."																																																			
"t＊s easy to switch off during the weekly grocery shop. Everything we need is conveniently at our fingertips, so why bother thinking about where it comes from? If we pick up a banana in the supermarket and see a brown spot, we can exchange it for another. If avocados are $5 this week, there＊s always a cheaper alternative in the next aisle. We avoid misshapen carrots and hunt around for the crunchiest, shiniest and cheapest red apples available.Time to stop the trolleys. The rapidly changing climate is shaking up what makes it to the supermarket shelves and Australian farmers are getting hurt in the process. Droughts, floods, heatwaves, changing rainfall patterns and declining yields are hammering them from all sides, and in a myriad of ways. Extreme weather events make Australia＊s food security increasingly vulnerable and extreme, unpredictable weather is climate change＊s specialty. Last summer, for instance,  were broken around the country as heatwaves and record hot days scorched many regions 每 particular in Queensland and New South Wales. As temperatures rise, this altersgrowing seasons and makes stock management more difficult. It＊s not just hotter conditions farmers are worried about, either. Severe flooding is also expected to increase in frequency and, while up in the north there may be fewer cyclones,  they will be more ferocious.Food bowl areas all across Australia, including the Murray Darling basin, are at risk from . If farmers cop it, then so do consumers. If we lose agricultural production from these areas, then we will all be giving up an ability to put fresh Australian fruit and vegetables on the table, with ease, every day. Australia as a whole will suffer because agriculture is a vital cog in our economy and is  of our industries to climate change. According to the , the agricultural sector at farm-gate contributes 2.4% to our total gross domestic product (GDP) 每 or $58.5bn. The majority of the 150,000 farm businesses in Australia are small, family owned businesses, with 96% having a turnover of $2m or less.So when extreme weather events, including the slow-moving ones like drought, do arrive they hurt farmers hard and fast. Next in line? Shoppers. Consider  of bananas following Cyclone Yasi in Queensland as a recent example. Continual, major losses from within this sector are not something that consumers, the economy or government can take lightly. For those that enjoy a glass of Australian wine with dinner, consider this: according to a recent  by the Climate Council, 70% of Australia＊s best grape growing regions are predicted to be in jeopardy by 2050 because grapes will ripen too early. The Shiraz of tomorrow will suffer from our lack of action today. By failing to swiftly and meaningfully act on climate change, we are dumping a lifetime of extreme weather events and food insecurity onto future generations. The good news is that all shoppers can play a significant role in mitigating the worst impacts of climate change on the food and drink everyone enjoys.First, demand immediate and meaningful action on climate change from the federal government. The electricity system is by far the biggest polluter. Australia urgently needs smart policies to fix the energy sector and significantly cut carbon pollution. A rapid transition to renewable energy is a must. Second, now is the time to rediscover paddock-to-plate connections and recognise that food doesn＊t start its life on the supermarket shelves. Learning more about the origins of your favourite groceries and buying local can not only reduce food miles and emissions but also support farm businesses all over Australia. When a dollar is spent on locally produced food, that dollar keeps circulating in the community; paying for Landcare membership, shopping at the local stock feeds or supporting essential services, like kindergartens. By contrast, a dollar spent on cheap imports flies straight out of the country.Finally consumers can throw their support behind farmers fighting against climate change and come up with a solution. Farmers are custodians of about half of Australia＊s landmass. Right across the country, farmers are exploring ways to use renewable energy, regenerate soils and sequester carbon. The old slogan said ※every family needs a farmer§. With climate change upon us, farmers need all families to stand up for Australian agriculture. Doing so will give future generations of farmers as well as consumers the quintessential Aussie fair go. "																																																			
"The backyard recycling of lead-acid car batteries is the number one source of chemical pollution in the world＊s poorer nations and leads to millions of years of healthy life being lost, according to a new report.The , published by NGOs Pure Earth and Green Cross Switzerland on Tuesday, reveals the top 10 most polluting industries in low and middle-income countries. , leather tanning, rubbish dumps and the dye industry are among the most polluting activities harming health and causing early deaths. The NGOs estimate 200 million people are at risk in the 50 nations they analysed.Old lead acid batteries are increasingly reused as some nations lack lead deposits and the rising number of cars is driving an upsurge in demand. However, in poorer nations the batteries are often opened with axes or hammers and the melting of the recovered lead takes places in homes. As a result, lead is spread throughout homes and communities and the dumping of battery remnants pollutes local soil and water supplies. Children are particularly vulnerable to the lead pollution, which can profoundly affect their development. South-east Asia is a hotspot for informal lead-acid battery recycling, but it also occurs in Africa and Central and South America.Richard Fuller, president of Pure Earth, said chemical pollution is a growing and under-reported problem: ※Pollution and the diseases that it causes have become a massive and extremely costly global problem.§ He said the pollution can be tackled but poorer nations can lack the resources to do so, meaning those people most in need end up further marginalised.David Hanrahan, a senior adviser at Pure Earth, said: ※Large as these numbers [of people at risk] are, they are almost certainly underestimates. In its  that an estimated 23% of all deaths in 2012 - representing 12.6 million people - were attributable to environmental risk factors, including pollution.§ He said the WHO estimated 20% of all cancers resulted from pollution.Another industry highlighted in the new report is small-scale artisanal gold mining, where individuals digs for gold and use highly toxic mercury to collect the precious metal. This activity produces 20% of the world＊s gold production but releases more mercury into the environment than any other sector worldwide. It is estimated that artisanal gold mining occurs in up to 55 countries and employs between 10-15 million miners. The report estimated that up to 1.6m ※disability adjusted life years§ (Dalys) are lost each year as a result of artisanal gold mining. A Daly is a year of healthy living lost by a person as a result of harm to their health. Informal lead-acid battery recycling is responsible for up to 4.8m lost Dalys each year, the report said."																																																			
"Conservation groups have called on  to abide by international agreements to curb catches of Pacific  after reports said the country was poised to exceed an annual quota two months early 每 adding to pressure on stocks that have already reached dangerously low levels.Japan, by far the world＊s biggest , has caused ※great frustration§ with its failure to abide by catch quotas intended to save the species from commercial extinction, said Amanda Nickson, the director of global tuna conservation at Pew Charitable Trusts.※Just a few years of overfishing will leave Pacific bluefin tuna vulnerable to devastating population reductions,§ Nickson said in Tokyo on Monday. ※That will threaten not just the fish but also the fishermen who depend on them.§Decades of overfishing have left the Pacific bluefin population at just 2.6% of its historical high, and campaigners say  must take the lead at a summit in South Korea this summer.In 2015, Japan and other members of the Western & Central Pacific Fisheries Commission agreed to curtail catches of immature bluefin, halving the catch of fish under 30kg from the average caught between 2002 and 2004.But Japanese media reported last week that the country would reach its catch limit for younger tuna for the year through to June two months early.Some fisheries workers have ignored the restrictions, aware that they will not be punished and can fetch premium prices for Pacific bluefin in Japan, where it is regarded as an important part of the country＊s culinary heritage.Campaigners support the fisheries commission＊s aim of rebuilding stocks to at least 20% of unfished levels by 2034 每 a target Nickson said was ※realistic and attainable§. She said further inaction could revive calls for a two-year commercial moratorium on catching Pacific bluefin. ※No country in the world cares more about the future of tuna than Japan,§ she said. ※Japan can take the lead, but it must start by committing itself to the 20% rebuilding plan.§ If that fails, she added, ※then a full commercial moratorium could be the only feasible course of action§.Aiko Yamauchi, the leader of the oceans and seafood group for WWF Japan, said it was time to penalise fishermen who violated catch quotas. ※The quotas should be mandatory, not voluntary,§ Yamauchi said. ※That＊s why the current agreement hasn＊t worked.§About , where it is served raw as sashimi and sushi.

"The theory that birds descended from bipedal dinosaurs,  to be exact, is now well-established within the palaeontological community. With that one out of the way, bird palaeontologists can focus on more pressing issues, such as the origin and evolution of Neornithes, the group of birds that comprises all living birds. Several groups of extinct birds are known to have existed alongside the dinosaurs, such as the aquatic diving birds Hesperornithiformes, the large, toothed Ichthyornithiformes, and the ※opposite birds§ Enanthiornithidae, named after the distinct anatomy of their shoulder girdle. None of them gave rise to the birds we see in our backyard today. The early evolution of modern birds is fuzzy, to say the least. Models based on  place the origin of Neornithes as far back as the Early Cretaceous, whereas others suggest that modern birds did not diversify until the Late Cretaceous (see  for a discussion). The sparse fossil record of Mesozoic Neornithes does little to clear things up. Modern birds can be split into two major groups; the  (meaning ※old jaws§) include the flightless ostriches and kiwis, whereas the  (※new jaws) contains all other birds. The earliest group of birds to split off within the Neognaths was that of the Galloanserae, the group containing the Anseriformes (ducks and allies) and the Galliformes (pheasants, grouse and allies). The earliest Neognath may be the galliform , dated to about 85 million years ago (Clarke, 2004), although some doubt about its presumed identity as a galliform remains. The description of  as a Late Cretaceous (68-66 million years) member of the duck lineage suggests that Neognaths had already split into modern groups before the end of the Mesozoic era. However, whether the radiation of the remaining Neognaths occurred before or after the Cretaceous 每 Paleogene extinction remains a topic of discussion. (How about the Palaeognaths, you ask? Well, that＊s a story for another time.)This is why bird paleontologists are looking with great interests at the period beyond the Cretaceous 每 Paleogene extinction, because this is where the ancestors of all our modern birds are to be found. A recent paper by a team of bird paleontologists from the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt, Germany, describes a penguin fossil foot from the mid-Paleocene Waipara Greensand location in New Zealand. This locality is dated to about 61 million years ago. The fossil foot belongs to a new species of penguin. The specimens were found at the same locality where another species of large penguin was found as well, (Slack et al. 2006), which is considered the oldest penguin known to date. Tarsometatarsi vary tremendously from one group of birds to another, and are therefore a  to identify birds. In penguins, the tarsometatarsi is very distinct; it is extremely short and broad, as if someone took a heron＊s tarsometatarsus, cut out the long bit in the middle and glued the top and bottom together again. But even within penguins, the shape of the tarsometatarsus varies. The new fossil foot differs from  and looks more like modern penguins, in its proportions and the shape of the hypotarsal canals, a set of ridges on the plantar side of the bone that keep the tendons for the foot in place during locomotion.The finding of this new fossil penguin foot alongside more primitive species of penguins indicates that penguin diversity early after the Cretaceous - Palaeogene extinction event was larger than expected. Moreover, the penguin foot shows characteristics that we are used to seeing in much younger penguins. This shows that the typical penguin tarsometatarsus morphology evolved more rapidly than we thought. The difference in tarsometatarsus morphology between the new specimen and likely reflects differences in locomotion both in the water and on land. The new tarsometatarsus is much stouter than and corresponds with small individuals of a species of giant penguin that lived 45-33 million years ago and could reach 165 cm in length. Thus, early penguins not only looked like modern penguins, they also attained very large sizes early on in their evolution, and kept it up for almost 30 million years. Why giant penguins disappeared around 20 million years ago remains unclear. Their disappearance roughly coincides with a rise in marine mammals, particularly the evolution of toothed whales (Odontoceti). Competition for food may have been a contributing factor in their demise (Ando and Fordyce 2014). This unexpected diversity of penguins so soon after the end of the Cretaceous has bearing on hypotheses regarding the early evolution of Neornithes. A number of molecular analyses suggested that different penguin groups started to develop around 62 million years ago (Jarvis et al. 2014; Prum et al. 2015). However, according to this hypothesis, the presence of both primitive and more evolved types of penguins, as shown by the material from New Zealand suggests that early penguins evolved in an extremely short time period. A much more likely scenario would be that penguins started to diversify in the Late Cretaceous, well before the mass extinction event. Why penguins survived, and did not, one can only wonder.

"Diesel vehicles must be banned from  if the UK is to meet its air pollution targets, a thinktank warned on Monday.Cars, vans and buses using diesel fuel are the leading cause of air pollution in the capital, and although steps are being taken to discourage their use, through the congestion charge and clean air zones, this will not be enough to clear the air, the .The number of diesel vehicles on the capital＊s streets has been increasing in recent years, Any phase-out of the vehicles will be controversial, as many drivers bought diesel cars in the belief that they were better for the environment.

Only bold action will make the capital＊s air safe to breathe again.§He added: ※[Our] analysis suggests Khan will ultimately need to phase out diesel cars and buses in order to reach legal compliance.§This would require the cooperation of national government, as the mayor lacks the power to achieve this result alone. The report, entitled Lethal and Illegal, found that under the current air pollution regime, London would fail to meet its legal requirements on air quality until 2025 or later. It is the only area of the UK forecast to take so long to meet air quality standards.Phasing out diesel vehicles from London＊s street would ※not be easy§ but would ※not be impossible§, the thinktank said. The report＊s authors called for a new Clean Air Act to be passed by parliament, to counter the uncertainty over whether the UK will adhere to EU air quality regulations after Brexit.Khan did not say whether he would seek to ban diesel vehicles altogether, but stressed his intention to clean up the capital＊s air. ※Protecting Londoners from our toxic filthy air is an issue of life and death,§ he said. ※Rather than turn a blind eye to this growing health crisis, it is high time ministers faced up to their responsibilities.§He said he was conducting , and urged people to make their views known.The analysis was backed by Greenpeace and ClientEarth, the activist charity which has taken the government to court on the issue.Alan Andrews, lawyer for ClientEarth, said: ※An ambitious and bold Clean Air Act is needed for the whole country. It should phase out diesel across the country and accelerate the shift to zero emission transport.

"Last week, the House ※Science§ committee held one of  to dispute the validity of climate science research. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) articulated the purpose of the hearing when speaking at a recent :For that, :Climate scientist Michael Mann was one of the witnesses testifying in last week＊s hearing. In the event＊s defining exchange, Mann quoted The Princess Bride, and then proceeded to quote Mervis＊ condemnation of Lamar Smith:Smith responded by asserting ※that is not known as an objective writer or magazine,§ to which the scientific community collectively gasped in horror. This is the magazine associated with Science which, along with Nature, are the two most highly-respected peer-reviewed scientific journals in the world. Mervis has been writing about science policy for Science magazine for 24 years. Lamar Smith, on the other hand is , entered a Wall Street Journal op-ed into the congressional record, and said this shortly after President Trump＊s inauguration:Unfortunately, as is usually the case in these hearings, despite being presented with the opportunity to learn from climate experts, most of the committee members seemed more interested in expressing their beliefs, however uninformed they might be.At the 2:04:05 mark in the hearing video, Rep. Dan Webster (R-FL) provided a perfect example of this behavior. He began by asking witness Judith Curry what causes ice ages (, which we＊ve known for nearly 100 years), so that he could make the point that  每 a point that usually leads to a common logical fallacy ().Webster proceeded to claim it was ※the standard belief of most scientists§ in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an ice age. This is another ; in reality, most climate scientists in the 1970s were predicting impending global warming. However, some scientists had projected that if the amount of sulfur dioxide pollution in the atmosphere were to quadruple, that would block enough sunlight to cause dramatic cooling. But since that pollution was also causing acid rain, governments developed regulations like the Clean Air Act, and . The scientists＊ projection wasn＊t wrong; rather, the scenario didn＊t happen because we took action to prevent it, much like if we take sufficient action to cut carbon pollution, we can prevent dangerous global warming. But Rep. Webster spent most of his allotted time expressing his ideologically-convenient beliefs about how clueless climate scientists are, rather than learning from the experts sitting in front of him. Dr. Mann could easily have explained this myth, but wasn＊t given the opportunity.Curry spent most of her time exaggerating climate uncertainties, . In his first question to the witnesses, Lamar Smith made it clear that＊s why she was invited (emphasis added):To be clear, it＊s been decades since we＊ve known enough about climate science to understand . In fact, . When driving a car on a foggy night, slowing down is the wise response to impaired vision; putting the pedal to the metal because of uncertainty as to whether there＊s a brick wall ahead would be stupid.In fact, as Mann explained at the 1:09:36 mark in the video, many climate impacts are happening  than expected. The brick wall is coming into view. Even one of the Republicans＊ own witnesses, Roger Pielke Jr. argued at the 1:57:05 mark for Congress to act:Rep. Randy Weber (R-TX) half-jokingly called this ※blasphemy.§ There was also a consensus among the witnesses that  would be damaging and counter-productive. If Republicans want to argue that we don＊t know enough to take action on climate change, cutting research funding would be grossly hypocritical. That＊s like turning off the headlights and putting on sunglasses.Speaking of consensus, Mann was the only witness who accurately represented the conclusions of  每 a point that was frequently raised during the hearing. Fellow witness John Christy, for example,  of publishing climate scientists who minimize human-caused global warming. His testimony focused on wrongly claiming that climate models have been falsified, using .Eventually, Lamar Smith claimed ※there is no consensus; the 97% was derived from a small sample of a small sample.§ My colleagues and I have a new paper addressing this claim that will be soon be published, so we＊ll return to this myth within the next few weeks.There was one particularly McCarthyesque exchange at the 1:28:50 mark in which Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) inquired:This brought to mind a scene from The American President:Higgins＊ concern is that members of  have suggested that if documents reveal that ExxonMobil knew of the threats its product poses (they did 每 we now know ), like the tobacco industry,  under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Rep. Higgins doesn＊t like this idea and confronted Mann, who is a scientific advisor to many climate organizations, including the Climate Accountability Institute. However, 17 state attorneys general have already formed  and determine if it＊s guilty of fraud, so it＊s difficult to understand why Higgins would attack Dr. Mann about this in what was supposed to be a scientific hearing.Unfortunately, last week＊s hearing confirmed that far too many Republican Party leaders are more interested in protecting the profits of big oil and coal companies than preserving a livable climate for future generations."																																																			
"unkering down under a sliver of shade along Cau Giay Street, west of Hanoi＊s city centre, Ha Van Son reclines on the seat of his motorbike taxi. The tree overhead offers little respite from the blistering sun, but he needs to earn a living, so he lowers his kickstand to the pavement and waits. Across the street, some new competition is being built. T-shaped beams tower above the narrow, clogged road: the beginnings of Vietnam＊s first metro system.The thirty-something driver isn＊t worried about job security, though. Like so many of his compatriots, he has accustomed to flitting from one job to the next, according to the whims of the nation＊s rapidly growing economy. ※If  wants to develop, we should get the metro,§ he says. ※It will reduce vehicles on the roadsand make our society more modern.§Hanoi, a city with , has to contend with heavy congestion and frequent traffic accidents. In recent years, . In May this year,  reported that the US embassy＊s  in Hanoi registered a ※hazardous§ spike in particulate matter, reportedly reaching a level seven times that recommended by the World Health Organisation.Though the government hopes the metro can tackle both traffic and environmental issues at once, the project has faced numerous delays and setbacks. What＊s more, convincing Hanoians to give up their motorbikes could turn out to be the biggest challenge yet.In 2008,  in the city were carried out by motorbikes and scooters 每 and a fast-growing share of the population is opting for cars. Currently there are roughly 4.9 million motorbikes and scooters on Hanoi＊s roads. The use of bicycles, once the dominant transport mode in the city, decreased dramatically as motorbikes and cars became more popular: in 1995, 47% of journeys were made by bicycle; in 2008, the figure had dropped to only 3%.Hanoi＊s Transport Plan the share of public transport from the current low figure of 9% of trips, to above 60% by 2030,by which time Hanoi is slated to have six new metro linesand three Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines. But the ambitions get even steeper. Last month, Hanoi＊s Party Committee outlined plans to  by 2025, in line with improved public transport. A total downtown ban of the vehicles would require a huge lifestyle shift for most residents 每 and put an enormous amount of pressure on the new metro system. None of the locals I speak to regard the 2025 plan as feasible.Ho Chi Minh City is planning , with two of the eight planned lines currently under construction and the first . Both the Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi projects have been described as Vietnam＊s first metro systems, but which network will open first remains to be seen. In Hanoi, a 12.5km line connecting the Nhon area to the downtown railway station was supposed to be operational by December 2016, but the expected completion date has been pushed back to 2020.According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a funding source of the project, about 15% of construction had been completed by the end of 2015. The line, which will be partially underground, will have 12 stations and is expected to accommodate 754,000 passengers a day by 2030.Hanoi-based urban planner Floriane Ortega, who worked on the planning of metro lines one and two, says the project has faced delays for several reasons. For one, there are resettlement and compensation issues involved in the construction project, and Vietnam lacks an overarching transport authority to streamline efforts. Hanoi Metropolitan Railway Management Board, the governmental body that oversees the metro project, did not respond to requests for comment.A line being constructed by Chinese contractor China Railway has encountered  from falling construction debris. Ortega explains that overall coordination between the contractors on different lines 每 French, South Korean, Japanese and Chinese firms 每 is lacking. There are issues with contractors wanting to use different ticketing systems, as well as a lack of consensus on how to best integrate stations, which could force pedestrians to exit one station and enter another if the problem is left unresolved, she says.If these obstacles are overcome ※the metro will dramatically change the notion of public space in this country,§ Ortega says, explaining that public spaces and pavements are currently used more for motorbike parking than for pedestrians. But once the metro opens, commuters who walk from stations to their destinations could force the pavements to be used for their intended purpose once again.But there＊s one more caveat to a thriving public transport system: Vietnam must first conquer its car problem.The country has agreed to eliminate all import duties by 2018 oncars originating from the 10 nations within the Asean Economic Community, of which it is a member. In addition, a reduced luxury tax on cars, which went into effect on 1 July this year, slashed the price tag for vehicles with engines of less than 1.5 litres. ※The Vietnamese have a huge demand for cars, especially family cars,§ says salesman Nguyen Xuan Gioi, who works in a Toyota dealership near the Cau Giay metro line. ※In 10 years, I think Hanoi will be like Bangkok. There will be more cars and fewer motorbikes.§Hanoi＊s urban layout begs to differ. Many streets, especially around the expansive West Lake, can only accommodate one vehicle at a time, forcing drivers on to pavements. In one neighbourhood, paths have been torn out and the roads widened to meet anticipated demand from car drivers once a nearby housing development is constructed.Jason Rush, communication specialist for ADB＊s south-east Asia branch, says the car craze is problematic for a city trying to sell the virtues of public transportation. ※Hanoi over the past 10 years has gone through somewhat of a car renaissance,§ he says. ※A lot of people are purchasing automobiles for the first time who were never able to afford them in the past.§Currently, less than 10% of Hanoians use public transportation. The public bus is cheap, but petrol to fill up a motorbike is even cheaper. Some residents are questioning whether an unspoken motivation for the metro project and the planned motorbike ban is to clear bikes off the streets to make room for more cars. Steve Jackson, head of communications for an international NGO who has lived in Hanoi since 2004, says the transition to cars has made him nostalgic for the waning days of the motorbike. At least traffic moved before cars came around, he muses. ※It＊s great if comfortable affordable public transport can be provided for the less well off 每 but not if it means the aim is to leave the roads for the wealthy and their cars,§ he says.It＊s hard to envision a Vietnamese city without motorbikes. It＊s not uncommon for locals to drive to the bakery at the end of their alley or to ※walk§ their dogs while steering their bikes with one hand, canines trotting alongside.Part of that attachment is driven by notions of economic progress. ※It represents freedom, it represents status sometimes, and it＊s hard to convince people to make the switch from that to public transport,§ Rush says.ADB＊s marketing efforts will focus on changing public sentiment about mass transportation. They are taking a page from the metro systems in Seoul,  and Bangkok, all of which marketed the metro as trendy and increased the number of discretionary riders.At the end of the day, Rush says, whether or not people use the metro depends on several factors: accessibility, affordability, aesthetics and amenities. The system should have accommodating parking lots, Wi-Fi and inviting and accessible spaces surrounding metro stations, he says. Another approach is to market the metro as a lifestyle choice. One idea being tossed around is to issue multipurpose metro cards, allowing electronic payments to be made at businesses around the city, similar to .This change won＊t happen overnight, and ADB will conduct studies over the next 12 to 18 months to determine which demographics are most likely to use the metro and for what reasons. Convincing residents to take the metro will likely get easier in time, once the system is more far-reaching.※It＊s easier to do when you have a big vibrant train system that penetrates every neighbourhood,§ Rush says. ※Obviously in Hanoi there＊s only going to be a few lines initially, so you have to have a medium-term trajectory for this.§For now, Hanoians will just have to keep donning their traffic fatigues 每 face masks and Hello Kitty helmets 每 and battling it out for their spot on the streets.

"ver the years, politicians of all stripes have had big ideas for Whitehall＊s business department. When he was industry secretary in the 1970s, Tony Benn thought state ownership, planning agreements with companies and protectionism were the answer to Britain＊s productivity problem.Twenty years later, Michael Heseltine said he would intervene before breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner to promote the interests of UK plc. When Gordon Brown was in deep trouble during the Great Recession of 2008-09, he wanted a big beast to provide support for key sectors of the economy. Burying the hatchet with an old foe, he called on Peter Mandelson to do the job.It＊s fair to say that  has yet to attain the status of a Benn, a Heseltine or a Mandelson. He may indeed prove to be one of those ministers who make little impression on a department that has traditionally had one of Whitehall＊s fastest-spinning revolving doors. There have been a couple of dozen industry secretaries since Benn was sacked by Harold Wilson after the first EU referendum in 1975: in those 41 years there have been just 10 chancellors.Even so, Clark has something never granted to any of his predecessors. He not only has a licence to intervene 每 it is part of his job description. Clark is minister for business, energy and 每 in one of the most eye-catching changes resulting from the arrival of Theresa May 每 .The message is clear. Gone are the days of laissez-faire, when Conservative industry secretaries thought it was their job to get out the way and allow free rein to market forces. Sajid Javid, an adherent to that philosophy, was shown the door in May＊s reshuffle after an undistinguished year in the job.Clark＊s rebadged department is a tacit admission that the rebalancing of the economy promised by George Osborne when he became chancellor six years ago has been an abject failure. There has been no ※march of the makers§, as witnessed by the fact that manufacturing output is still almost 10% below where it was when the Great Recession began in 2008, and the UK is running a balance of payments deficit unmatched in its peacetime history.Such growth as there has been during the economy＊s recovery has been driven by the housing market and concentrated in London and the south-east. As May now appears to appreciate, voting patterns in last month＊s referendum are closely linked to the grotesquely unbalanced state of the?economy.Talking about an industrial strategy is not, of course, the same as actually delivering one. And such has been the relentless hollowing out of manufacturing over the past four decades that it will take time and patience for a new approach to bear fruit.It is pretty clear what needs to be done. Clark should, as Mandelson did, seek to ensure that the UK competes in the growth industries of the future, such as green tech, genomics and robotics. He needs to import the German model of long-term finance. His department should be looking to the US to see how ideas can be spun off from universities and commercialised. The tendency of the private sector to hoard cash provides a strong case for a national investment bank.The chances of all this being achieved in this parliament are remote. It may be that the government＊s attention will be so taken up with Brexit that it won＊t have the bandwidth to flesh out a meaningful new approach. There might be a brain drain of officials to the Brexit department; Clark might prove to be not up to the job; the Treasury might stamp all over the new philosophy if it starts to look too threatening.But at this stage, it would be wrong to cavil. Putting an industrial strategy at the heart of the business department is just a start. Yet it is welcome nonetheless.She can＊t possibly mean it. That, roughly speaking, has been the private reaction of big-company bosses to Theresa May＊s idea that employees should be represented on boards.The size of the sample of opinion is necessarily small. It was, after all, only on Monday that May, still facing competition from Andrea Leadsom for the leadership of the Tory party, made her pledge in a campaign speech.By Wednesday evening May was prime minister and the big beasts of the corporate world were raising detailed objections. One chief executive of a FTSE 100 financial services firm argued that the proposal would be unworkable in his industry.His point was that, in a post-crisis world, regulators were stricter about who could be a director of a big bank or insurer. A high level of financial competence and experience is a central requirement of the senior managers＊ regime. How are those rules compatible with appointing employees 每 possibly junior employees or middle-rankers 每 to boards?Up to a point, it＊s a reasonable objection. It would be silly to rip up the senior managers＊ regime, which is a sensible recognition that big financial firms are different. When they fail, the damage can spill into the rest of the economy.But a blunt ※it＊s impossible§ is too unimaginative. A new class of employee director could be created for financial firms with lesser regulatory demands. After all, the role is meant to bring expertise that the usual suspects can＊t 每 a real-world perspective on issues like executive pay.At that point, the old guard tends to raise a second objection: firms are owned by shareholders and it＊s up to them who joins the board. Strictly speaking, that correct. But, again, it misses May＊s point that the scrutiny provided by non-executives, when ※drawn from the same, narrow social and professional circles as the executive team§, has not been good enough.In truth, May＊s idea does not amount to a revolution. One employee director on a board will not change corporate culture overnight. But it might turn the dial slightly. In an age when trust in business is so low, far-sighted firms should consider the advantages instead of instinctively throwing up obstacles. May should keep pressing. has come up with a final bill for the cost of the Deepwater Horizon accident in 2010: $62bn (?47bn). The British oil company has said will take another $2.5bn hit for the April 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill in its second-quarter accounts on 26 July.The vast financial punishment is made up of fines, liabilities and other payments resulting from that one fateful day when a well blowout killed 11 workers and caused the biggest environmental disaster in US history.The financial toll on BP contrasts sharply with the 1988 Piper Alpha accident in the North Sea when 167 people died. Occidental Petroleum of the US was not fined and made just one compensation payout of $100m.BP could easily have been sunk by this episode, just like its rig. But $62bn later, it is still producing. And that is quite an achievement."																																																			
"his week brought fresh outrage from conservatives as the new secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, told the National Press Club ※§ and Paul Keating, seen by many as a neoliberal champion, agreed with her. But rather than provoke cries of communism and class warfare, for anyone who has been paying attention over the past decade, the correct response to McManus and Keating＊s assertions should be ※well, duh§.McManus＊s speech, in which she not only rang the death knell for neoliberalism but reiterated the right for unions to resist unjust laws (pretty much a central tenet of unions ever since unions were first illegally formed in the 1800s) drew the expected shrieks from the right. The Australian＊s editorial, for example, referred to it as ※§, and .It＊s always class warfare when those representing the low paid worry about inequality.  每 as occurred on the same day as McManus＊s speech 每 class warfare is never mentioned. That＊s because neoliberals see company tax cuts as good for workers. A lower company tax, so the theory goes, leads to increased investment, which in turns increases productivity and leads to better pay for workers. It＊s a nice theory, and one that works nicely so long as you ignore that over the past decade productivity has risen while . The great thing about neoliberalism (a bit of a dopey term, that really just means ※small government-pro-market§ policies) is that it always works so long as you ignore all the times it doesn＊t. In the 1980s, neoliberal economic reforms did work well,  and the deepest post-second world war recession Australia has ever seen.The great period of moderation from the early 1990s onwards, where monetary policy took over the role of stimulating the economy from government spending, also worked well so long as you ignore rising inequality, declining levels of infrastructure, , the  and the growth of radicalism which has seen racism and xenophobia come into major parties, and a situation where a senator of this country can actually  in a mainstream newspaper that ※many Jews want to suppress Holocaust denialism§.And the reality is we didn＊t need to wait for the GFC to know there were problems with letting the market rule. In , we have the biggest market failure in the history of economics. For pro-free marketers climate change is a nasty bur in their shoe. If   rising sea levels, coastal inundation, dislocation of large masses of people, increased intensity of tropical storms and droughts, and grave risks to food and water supply, then you have to accept the market failed to account for such impacts and not only allowed, but ensured they would happen.Little wonder many free marketeer thinktanks and political parties have instead embraced lunatic theories about climate change being a conspiracy involving the UN, Nasa, every university in the world, China, all major meteorological bodies, the World Bank and the makers of tin foil hats. Delusion is preferable to admitting fault. The love of neoliberalism also sees in Australia an odd nostalgia for the 1980s 每 a time where under the Hawke government ※reform§ flourished. Much like the belief in the infallibility of the small government/pro-market policy, the conservative nostalgia for the 1980s only makes sense if you ignore many things.Yes, when the Hawke government took power in 1983 it brought with it a smaller government outlook 每 where balancing the budget was crucial, and where lowering tariffs, privatising assets and letting the market operate was championed. But it was also a government that introduced the . It was also a long time ago. We are now as close to the 1983 election of the Hawke government as people at that time were to the 1949 election of the Menzies government.Arguing Hawke and Keating＊s approach to the economy is the path to follow is roughly as sensible as someone in the 1980s suggesting Ben Chifley＊s policy to nationalise the banks was worth exploring. Policy moves forward and good policy should react to failures. And right now there is a lot of failure.From 1990 to 2007 the seven largest economies in the world grew on average by 2.3% each year; since 2010 (which leaves out the two horror GFC years of 2008 and 2009) that growth has averaged just 1.7%. In Australia over the same two periods the average growth level has gone from 3.3% to 2.6%. Things have flatlined so greatly since the GFC that the Treasury now views Australia＊s long-term average growth level as 2.75% rather than the previous level of 3%.And remember this is at a period where  and industrial disputes at near record lows. So when Paul Keating this week  statement by saying that ※since 2008 ... we have a comatose world economy held together by debt and central bank money§, he was stating the bleeding obvious. Such has been the record of the world economy over the past 10 years that you would start to question Keating＊s intelligence were he not to assert that ※liberal economics has run into a dead end and has had no answer to the contemporary malaise§.It is a view even the IMF 每 the former arch champions of neoliberalism 每 are also . Last year researchers for the IMF argued the benefits from austerity measures (the most beloved neoliberal measure) were ※fairly difficult to establish§ but that ※the costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent§.That doesn＊t mean we need to return to the 1970s, but neither does it mean we regard all the movements since the 1980s as positive 每 whether it be the push for ever lower company taxes, greater industrial relations flexibility, reduced government spending, falling real Newstart payments, failed work-for-the-dole schemes, taxation policy that rewards property speculation and lack of government intrusion to deal with climate change either through a price on carbon or investments in renewable energy and the energy market.  isn＊t being radical when she argues that neoliberalism has run its course, she is merely responding to evidence."

Working with Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, the Mozambique government＊s institute for agricultural research (IIAM) and the Darwin Initiative, Bayliss was sitting at his laptop looking at Google Earth in 2005, when he wondered whether mountains in  might also harbour some of the species he was uncovering in nearby Malawi. So he and a Malawian botanist named Hassam Patel decided to take a look.As , over the years Bayliss and the Kew Gardens team have since identified three new species of snake, eight species of butterfly, a bat, a crab, two chameleons and many plants, as well as a trove of rare birds that are critically endangered.However, no one has ever journeyed into the heart of the forest until now. Previous discoveries came from the forest base camp, the peak and a small satellite camp, all on the lower eastern edge. To explore Mabu＊s secrets further, an expedition has been undertaken this month by the international scientific and environmental reporting initiative .The Alliance Earth team＊s objectives were to create a 3D map, uncover new species, check on the health of the forest, publish an ethno-botanical study, seek out potential non-timber forest products, produce a feature documentary and film a 360-degree virtual reality experience for museums and science centres around the world, so everyone can explore the mountain＊s mysteries.※This is a new species of Dipsadoboa,§ Bayliss says, holding the poisonous tree snake with a twinge of obvious concern. As it writhes, he holds it farther away from his torso. ※This is currently undescribed, it doesn＊t have a name yet.§ Stretching out imploringly, the snake tries to reach the perceived safety of my video camera. ※To find an actual new species of snake is extremely exciting, and very rare.§ He has now found three new snakes in Mabu＊s forest.According to Bayliss, on this trip the team have identified at least one new butterfly species, and quite possibly more, once genetic testing confirms them. They have also found a Caecilian, one of the rarest animals on Earth, which is sort of a cross between a reptile and amphibian, and may be a new type of its kind.But these precious finds aren＊t the only new discoveries that have him excited. Under a huge tree he airs his wet boots, squeezing his socks dry before putting them on again. ※Yesterday was great. We discovered a new waterfall, which is fantastic. We＊ve never been here before, and because it＊s the rainy season the water was just crashing through the rocks.§More discoveries have come daily, such as the ※valley of giants§, an open canyon with a central raised ridge surrounded by the largest grouping of big trees yet found. Their vast trunks stretch upwards like a cathedral, blending into the green nave of leaves hundreds of metres above. These waterfalls, huge trees, deep canyons, and riverside camping spots are important geographical discoveries that Bayliss hopes will help bring tourists here.At times the forest guides are clearly as perplexed about directions as the team, looping round in ever-widening circles in search of a way across the maze of folded valleys, often climbing up and down one punishing ridge after another in order to make headway.Senior hunter turned guide Of谷lio Cavali?o, 41, and his son Bartolomeo, 26, joined the expedition one morning before breakfast, hiking from their home many kilometres away. They heard through the grapevine that Bayliss had returned and so tracked him down. Cavali?o and Bayliss have worked together on every visit he has made to Mabu＊s forest. The local hunter and famous scientist have developed a friendship and deep respect for one another.Once Cavali?o arrived, the team started to push deeper into the most unexplored parts of the eastern forest, following the tops of the ridges and making better time.Guides such as Cavali?o have an intimate knowledge of the area, making the outside ※discovery§ of Mabu a purely scientific designation. According to him, the local people have benefited from the forest for generations. It even saved their lives during the back-to-back conflicts that started in 1964 with the war of independence against Portugal, before segueing into the civil war that finally ended in 1992.His friend, 38-year-old guide Ernesto Andr谷, agrees. He grew up in the forest, sheltered from the ravages of war, with dozens of other people in small forest camps. Not far into the undergrowth, holes the size of unfilled graves are clearly man-made. Standing in one, Andr谷 explains that these sheltered whole families and were the only way to hide the sounds of crying children from the Portuguese soldiers who tried to hunt them down.On a remote ridge line with another potential new butterfly in his net, Bayliss talks about the future of the mountain. ※Every new discovery helps make the case for the mountain to be officially protected,§ he says.But time is of the essence. The team finds the forest intact, yet still not officially protected. told how, despite a two-year ban on timber exports, corruption and organised crime are still stripping Mozambique of forests such as this. According to the independent Environmental Investigation Agency, as much as $130m worth of hardwoods are stolen from Mozambique annually. Much of it is sent to China.Ecologically aware visitors could help build a tourism industry here that protects the forest and benefits the community in a sustainable way, while safeguarding the incredible biodiversity, according to , the Mozambican environmental justice group that has been working at Mabu since 2009 to create and implement an eco-tourism plan for the mountain.The group＊s forestry specialist, Rene Machoco, explains that its vision is for Mabu to be legally designated as a community conservation area.Andr谷 says that before Justi?a Ambiental came, his community didn＊t think the forest was particularly valuable, ※but then it was explained and we knew the truth. The forest is life and the forest is wealth§.Tourism is only one way to help people like Ernesto benefit from their home. Expedition team member Ana Alecia Lyman is a non-timber forest products specialist based in Mozambique who runs Bio ?leos de Miombo. ※Non-timber forest products, such as honey or mushrooms, can be sustainably derived from the landscape to generate income in rural communities without jeopardising local biodiversity,§ she says.After seeing the forest first-hand, she is enthusiastic and feels that the more people who are engaged in these sustainable value chains, the more local investment there can be in the health of the forest.Under the tree canopy, Bayliss is hunting an elusive butterfly that finally flutters and rests on the leafy forest floor in a scattered beam of sunlight. Butterflies use solar energy to fly. Their wing veins are usually dark in order to channel energy from the sun to engage their muscles. This is why when they are seen slowly folding their wings while perched in the sunlight, they are getting ready to take to the air. But the shy brown butterfly with the spotted wing markings is no match for the speedy scientist from Wales. A deft swing loops the net shut, ※I think I got it!§※This is probably a new species,§ he says, looking through the net and walking over to a sunny spot. Extracting it gently he examines the wing spots. ※This is probably the one we have been looking for.§ He looks closer. With a breathless voice he breaks with his usual understatement. ※This is very exciting 每 this is the first time I have ever seen this butterfly.§What else awaits discovery in the remote forest of Mabu＊s basin? Potential answers to that question sit snugly in Bayliss＊s anchor-like briefcase: motion-sensitive video cameras, the first ever to be deployed at Mabu. Encased in steel boxes and strapped to trees, the four high-definition cameras will be left running at secret locations deep in the foliage for two years.Having finished securing the last camera above a stream, Bayliss washes his hands in the clear water among the mossy rocks, looking satisfied. ※Every time we come to Mabu we discover something new. Who knows what we will find next?§The question hangs in the air as he turns around and starts back on the long hike to base camp with his butterfly net in hand, his briefcase empty, and his wet boots squishing merrily."																																																			
"One in four of the world＊s children will be living in areas with extremely limited water resources by 2040 as a result of climate change, the UN has warned.Within two decades, 600 million children will be in regions enduring extreme water stress, with a great deal of competition for the available supply. The poorest and most disadvantaged will suffer most, according to research published by the children＊s agency, Unicef, to mark World  Day on Wednesday.Drought conditions and conflict are driving deadly water scarcity in parts of Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. Unicef anticipates that more than 9 million people will be without safe drinking water this year in Ethiopia alone. Nearly 1.4 million children face imminent risk of death from acute malnutrition in , Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen.The report, , looked at the threats to children＊s lives and wellbeing caused by depleted sources of safe water and the ways in which climate change will intensify these risks.As industrialisation and demographic shifts increase consumption, areas of south Asia and the Middle East will be particularly affected, according to one of the report＊s authors, Nicholas Rees. ※Where demand is extremely high then water stress will increase. It will go up in areas of rapid urbanisation, and we are already seeing that throughout sub-Saharan  and Asia,§ he said.Another report published on Wednesday warned that Iran is grappling with an unprecedented water crisis, and faces a greater threat from its environmental challenges than those arising from regional political issues or terrorism. , from London-based NGO Small Media, said that shortages could transform vast swaths of the country into near-uninhabitable areas in the coming decades.※Iran is facing a water crisis that is unparallelled in its modern history. Lakes and rivers are dying, droughts are increasing in frequency, and even Iran＊s deepest groundwater reserves are being sucked dry by Iran＊s growing population and its thirsty agricultural sector,§ the report said. ※Resultant soil erosion is accelerating the destruction of forest ranges across the country, and contributing to a sharp increase in dust storms and air pollution.§It warned that ecosystems were collapsing, with some species of wildlife on the brink of extinction. Lake Urmia, the country＊s largest lake, is a biosphere reserve recognised by Unesco: the report says it has shrunk to 12% of its size since the 1970s, ※owing to frequent droughts, and aggressive, poorly implemented water management policies upstream§. Across the world, the UN＊s report says that 36 countries are facing extremely high levels of water stress, which occurs when demand far exceeds the renewable supply available. Warmer temperatures, rising sea levels, increased floods, droughts and melting ice affect the quality and availability of water, as do sanitation systems.The impact of climate change on water sources is not inevitable, according to the report, which made a series of recommendations designed to help curb the impact of climate change on the lives of children. These include calls for governments to prioritise access to safe water for the most vulnerable children above other water needs, and for communities to diversify water sources.※We want to reduce child deaths. That is the goal. But we are not going to end child deaths without addressing environmental threats that they face,§ said Rees.※We focus on their susceptibility to disease but if we don＊t also address the broad environmental risks we are going to fall short.  is often felt through a change in the water 每 whether it＊s a flood, rising sea levels or something else 每 and the effect of a changing climate is often felt by children through water first.§The NGO  of how vulnerable rural communities＊ struggles to access clean water were being compounded by extreme weather events and climate change.India, one of the fastest growing economies and home to almost a fifth of the world＊s population, was ranked in an annual  as having the greatest number of people living rurally without access to clean water: 63 million. In terms of those making progress, the report said, Paraguay has achieved the biggest improvements in getting water to rural dwellers. More than 94% of its rural population now has access to safe water, compared with 51.6% in 2000.Papua New Guinea, Madagascar and Mozambique were among the worst performing countries for rural access to clean water.WaterAid＊s chief executive, , said many of the countries featured in the report were already being hit regularly by severe cyclones, floods and drought. ※Rural communities 每 which are marginalised by their remote location and a continued lack of funding for basic services 每 often bear the greatest burden of these events,§ she said.WaterAid is calling on international and national leaders to deliver on promises to meet the sustainable development goals, including a goal to ensure access to safe water and sanitation."																																																			
																																																			
"Sarah Mukherjee accuses the EU proposal to ban neonicotinoids from fields of being ※political§ (). Damn right. If she means supporting the long-term interests of people over the short-term blinkered interests of a few businesses, I can hardly think of a?better definition of the word.From DDT to lead in petrol, businesses have fought tooth and nail against legal restrictions, until they came and the predicted disasters never happened. But why stop at fields and neonics? Our parks and gardens have become vital havens for all kinds of wildlife and yet our garden centres are filled with wildlife-unfriendly herbicides and pesticides, ironically shelved alongside the ※bee and butterfly friendly§ plants. At least farmers can argue, whether or not you agree, that their livelihoods and our food is at stake. Little is at stake if we ban all poisons from our parks and gardens, beyond a few weeds on our paths and some greenfly. Future generations will be astounded that we took so long."																																																			
																																																			
																																																			
"A woman who paddled 400 miles up the length of England＊s waterways found them choked with thousands of plastic items, from bottles and bags to toys and dummies. completed the 22-day challenge on Sunday with swollen knuckles and more than 2,000 photos of plastic junk she found in canals and rivers from Godalming in Surrey to Kendal in Cumbria.The 30-year-old paddle boarder catalogued more than 1,600 plastic bottles, over 850 plastic bags, 40 footballs, 24 toys, seven dummies, a pair of traffic cones and one bin lid.Carr said she was  after being appalled at the amount of plastic she encountered while doing stand-up paddle boarding in Paddington basin, in London. ※I was getting plastic bags and whatever caught up in my fin ... it was just, like, this is ridiculous 每 you can＊t even paddle along in the water without getting plastic caught to the paddle board in some way,§ she said.That experience prompted her to look into the way inland waterways contributed to the estimated .※For me, it felt something needed to be done to raise awareness of the fact that our canals and rivers are choking with this stuff. There＊s great attention globally on the oceans which is really important but 80% of that comes from inland sources.§Carr found a big difference between more rural areas in Lancashire and Cumbria, which were relatively ※clean and immaculate§, and cities where she found a high concentration of plastic debris, in particular plastic kids＊ toys.While her aim was not to clean up the rubbish directly but document it, she said she hoped the records would inspire local people to go out and help clean up their local hotspots. People on the route were kind and generous, she said, and wanted to do something about the plastic dumped in their waterways. ※It was something they felt affected them, but they didn＊t know how to go about doing something about it.§The physical demands of standing up and paddling for 12 hours a day in all weathers before stopping to camp and sleep caught up with her at the end. ※Physically I don＊t think I realised how exhausted I was until I stopped, and sat down,§ she said. ※The joints in my hands, my knuckles, are really swollen, from gripping the paddle, and from the repetitive movement.§The 193 locks on her route were the most exhausting part, with Carr having to portage 每 carry her board and 30kg of gear 每 around them and other obstacles. Carr began paddle boarding around two years ago, after being diagnosed with cancer, which is now in remission. , which she described as ※one of the best adventures I＊ve had in my life§, , and was supported by the Ordnance Survey."																																																			
"y the four chimneys of Battersea power station, between tower cranes and builders＊ cabins, is an unobtrusive metal mast. At the top, a watchful figure looks down upon the 3,000 workers bustling around this vast ?9bn construction site.※Female,§ says , with a deft glance through his binoculars. ※She＊s protecting her nest site. There was an intruding female about half an hour ago.§Suddenly, she＊s off, arrow-like, steepling down from her mast and over the Thames, in pursuit of an unlucky bird. This year, the first residents and businesses will move into the revamped , but the London landmark already has its first family. A pair of peregrine falcons have been nesting here since 2000. These fearsome wild birds of prey, the fastest member of the animal kingdom, are thriving in the capital. There were three pairs in London at the turn of the century; now there are 30, probably the second-highest density of peregrines anywhere in the world 每 after New York. The peregrine, once considered a bird of lonely rocky cliffs, almost fell extinct in Britain in the last century. Now it has reinvented itself as an urban creature. Pairs nest in many cities and towns, including , , , ,  and . The peregrine is safer in the city than the countryside.It＊s spring, and the peregrines of Battersea are laying eggs. We walk closer to the metal mast topped by a wooden nestbox. The peregrine peers over the edge, cocking its head to size us up with one enormous eye. This alpha female is the most powerful wild bird in . Peregrines will bully and sometimes kill much bigger birds, from buzzards to crows. And the female is a third bigger than the male. Over the past three years, this bird has successfully fledged 11 chicks. ※It shows she＊s a very virile female. She＊s in her prime,§ says Morrison, admiringly.Morrison is one of the reasons for the peregrine boom in London, alongside volunteers for the , which also monitors the birds. He was a steel fixer on a construction site in Battersea when he discovered they were nesting in the then derelict power station. He＊d always loved birds, and knew that this rare bird enjoys the highest legal protection. He contacted , the government＊s wildlife watchdog, and began surveying urban peregrines. Under his watch, pairs of this fiercely territorial bird have taken up residence on high buildings. Once they ※hold§ a territory, they sometimes struggle to breed successfully without a purpose-built nestbox, so Morrison provided some. Six years ago, he retired and became a full-time peregrine consultant and ecologist.He faced his biggest challenge in 2013. Battersea＊s peregrines nested just below one of its famous towers but the chimneys needed to be taken down and rebuilt as part of the power station＊s transformation. The  spent more than ?100,000 on a relocation plan, building the mast at exactly the same height as the old nest in the quietest corner of the construction site. When the birds finished breeding that year, Morrison closed off their old nest and waited. It was a tense moment. ※It＊s nature, isn＊t it? You can＊t predict what they are going to do.§ But the birds took up residence in his new nestbox and have successfully bred there ever since. ※There are very few other species that would adapt and wouldn＊t just go,§ says Morrison. ※They will even hunt from the cranes here. They are not going to move.§They hunt at dawn, before work starts at 8am, and then ※sit up there watching the world go by§, says Morrison. Alongside his nest sites, an all-you-can-eat urban buffet is the main reason the birds are thriving. As we gaze at the peregrine, flocks of feral pigeons scurry through the air just below her. If a particularly large flock breaks away, ※it gets too much for the peregrines and they are off in pursuit§, says Morrison. ※One of the most spectacular hunts I＊ve ever seen is from the power station chimneys. They hunt from here every day.§Peregrines target weaker pigeons but will also devour starlings, black-headed gulls and most migrating birds, which often follow the river. They are also partial to a recent arrival in London: ring-necked parakeets. Every winter, Morrison checks his nestboxes and cleans them: the strangest prey he has found up there is the remains of a hen pheasant.The naturalist and ※urban birder§ , who grew up in London, remembers having to travel to the coast as a boy to see peregrines. He first saw urban peregrines as a teenager, when he visited New York. ※Now, virtually every city I visit I expect to see a peregrine,§ he says. As peregrine numbers grew in London, he set up the Tower 42 bird study group to monitor the migration of birds of prey. ※From the tower, you can see upwards of six peregrine territories across London,§ he says.Lindo＊s motto is ※look up§. Seven years ago, he turned up at Tate Modern with a large, empty picture frame, and set up a telescope. ※I called my ＆picture＊ Peregrinations. I had a queue of people looking through the telescope at peregrines. The kids were going, ＆Oh wow, that＊s amazing,＊ and the adults were saying, ＆Are they just here to cull the pigeons?＊ They are wild peregrines. The most amazing predator on the planet. They are a symbol of power and speed, but also a symbol of urban birding. You can see some amazing things in the heart of the concrete jungle.§Many city dwellers miss the peregrines above. Most London nests are also a closely guarded secret because they are still at risk from egg collectors and, occasionally, rogue falconers who steal peregrine chicks because wild birds tend to be better hunters than captive-bred individuals. But peregrines can be seen on Tate Modern and Charing Cross hospital, and a pair nest on the Houses of Parliament, too.At Battersea power station, the workers have embraced the birds. They are a kind of totem for this new development of more than 4,500 homes, restaurants and businesses. When it is finished, the developers plan to put telescopes in its new park so residents and visiting tourists can enjoy watching them. Morrison is quite a celebrity on site. A middle-aged builder in a hard hat approaches. ※Are you David? I＊ve just seen them, just now,§ he says excitedly. ※One peregrine came over and tried to jump on the other§ 每 a mating attempt.Notices tell builders to look out for fallen falcons and all 3,000 workers have been briefed about the ※falcon recovery plan§ 每 what to do if a bird (usually a juvenile taking its first flight) is found on the ground. They may be masters of the sky, but peregrines can become stranded on the ground, where they are preyed upon by foxes. So workers are taught to guard the bird until Morrison or a trained colleague arrives. They take grounded juveniles to a high platform where the parents can feed them until they fly. Battersea＊s chimneys have almost been rebuilt now, and the developer and Morrison have created a new nestbox behind a natural hole in the brickwork. When the building is complete in a few years＊ time, Morrison will oversee the peregrines＊ transition back to their old home.It seems ironic that this supremely wild animal is safer in a busy city than the countryside. In rural Britain, peregrines are still illegally shot or poisoned. Conservationists believe that these birds of prey are illegally killed because they threaten the profitability of lucrative grouse shoots. Lindo also points out that pigeon-fanciers ※absolutely detest§ peregrines. ※Any peregrine nesting in an urban area is less likely to be persecuted,§ says Lindo. ※Becoming more urban is a blessing, but they still face dangers when they wander. When the youngsters move off into the surrounding countryside, that＊s where their problems start.§Peregrine populations in provincial places are limited by the lack of high buildings, apart from cathedral spires. But as London becomes more high-rise, is there any limit to its peregrine population? Just as city-dwelling people adapt to less personal space, so do peregrines. According to Morrison, the average peregrine territory has shrunk from 2.5 miles (4km) in radius at the turn of the century to 1.5 miles today. ※I get contacted a lot by people saying, ＆We＊ve got pigeons, can we have peregrines?＊§ says Morrison. ※Everyone wants them.§"																																																			
"The author of a report on how London＊s illegal air pollution disproportionately affects deprived schools has said City Hall under  held back the study＊s negative findings, while publicising the positive ones. an unpublished Greater London authority (GLA) report on Monday that showed how deprived schools in the capital were disproportionately affected by toxic air, leading the new mayor, Sadiq Khan, to accuse Johnson of burying .A spokesman for Johnson on Tuesday defended his record on air pollution as mayor and said he had not hid its impact from Londoners. ※To suggest Boris Johnson＊s administration was somehow trying to hide the extent of London＊s air quality issues is risible,§ he said.But Katie King, director at Oxford-based environmental consultancy Aether and the author of the 2013 report, said that the GLA had publicly disclosed the positive conclusions in the report 每 that the number of people exposed to illegal pollution would fall by 2020 每 but had held back the negative findings.※The crux of the report was about understanding the inequalities of air pollution, so they chose not to make public the findings regarding inequality,§ she told the Guardian. ※The information that they did take from the report was the positive, that exposure was predicted to fall in the future.§The full report was never published but some of its findings, that the number of Londoners exposed to illegal air pollution was forecast to drop from 1 million in 2015 to around 300,000 in 2020, were highlighted publicly in .※Inequalities as a result of air pollution are predicted to reduce by 2020 as a result of new policies predominantly resulting from reductions in road transport emissions, most notably associated with the ULEZ [Ultra Low Emissions Zone, a clean air zone planned for 2020],§ said the progress report. It also noted deprived communities were more likely to be exposed to poor air quality.But it failed to mention the unpublished report＊s revelation that in 2010, 433 of the city＊s 1,777 primary schools were in areas where pollution breached the EU limits for NO2. Of those, 83% were considered deprived schools, with more than 40% of pupils on free school meals. Of the remaining schools located in areas below the pollution limit, less than a fifth were in deprived areas.A spokeswoman for Khan said: ※It is difficult to understand why the last mayoralty decided to cover it up and not fully release it in 2013 每 they clearly didn＊t want Londoners to know the dire state of pollution in the capital.§Caroline Russell, a Green party assembly member, said: ※Children are at risk of reduced lung capacity and are particularly vulnerable to developing asthma from excessive vehicular pollution. It is staggering that Boris Johnson sat on this report for two and a half years.§Labour MP Mary Creagh  that it was ※completely and totally unacceptable§ that the report had not been published.Johnson, speaking on Tuesday morning during a visit to an aluminium processing plant near Hixon in Staffordshire, denied there had been any cover-up and said it was ※absurd§ to suggest so. He said he had made a speech in 2015 ※highlighting this very fact and saying that we needed to do something to solve it.※I made the very point about primary schools and poor air quality in areas of deprivation. So as cover-ups go it wasn＊t a particularly brilliant one, considering I made a speech about it.§His office said the mayor had driven down pollution during his eight years as mayor, but did not deny he had stopped the full report from being released. ※... Mr Johnson put in place the most ambitious and comprehensive measures to address air pollution of any major world city,§ a spokesman said.He added: ※Mr Johnson never hid the impact of air pollution from Londoners. He commissioned a study into the health impacts of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), again a world first, and drove detailed air quality work around schools with a qualitative study into interventions and the reduction of exposure.§He said that emissions of nitrogen oxides, which include NO2, had declined 25% between 2008 每 when he took office 每 and 2013. Johnson＊s office also pointed to a separate study commissioned by the Transport for London and GLA while he was mayor, .The former deptuy mayor, Matthew Pencharz, took to Twitter to defend Johnson＊s record, saying he had achieved a series of ＆world firsts＊ on pollution.Johnson＊s spokesman also attacked Khan＊s plans, , to more than double an Ultra Low Emissions Zone to tackle the city＊s dirty air.※... First up he can explain to Londoners how he intends as the self-proclaimed mayor for business to deliver an enlarged ULEZ in just three years without penalising motorists, schools, and small business owners who purchased diesel vehicles in good faith, and when new cleaner EURO6 diesel vans [a cleaner standard of engine] aren＊t even on the market yet,§ he said."																																																			
"In 1893 the Norwegian explorer  embarked on a mission of extraordinary boldness and ingenuity. He planned to become the first person to reach the north pole by allowing his wooden vessel, , to be engulfed by sea ice and pulled across the polar cap on an ice current.Ultimately, Nansen ended up abandoning the Fram and skiing hundreds of miles to a British base after he realised he was not on course to hit the pole, but the ship made it across the ice cap intact and the expedition resulted in groundbreaking scientific discoveries about the  and weather patterns.Now, more than a century on, scientists are planning to retrace this epic voyage for the first time, in the most ambitious  research expedition to date.The  (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) mission will be the first since Nansen＊s to traverse the polar ice cap by ship and will aim to answer big questions about the Arctic, including why the region is warming faster than any other place on Earth.During the year-long, 1,500-mile trip, teams of scientists 每 protected from polar bears by armed guards 每 will disperse across the polar cap to take measurements and make reports that have never been possible before.The mission＊s co-leader Prof Markus Rex, of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam, Germany, said: ※The plan is to travel in summer 2019, when sea ice is thin and its extent is much smaller. We can make our way with our icebreaker Polarstern into the thin sea ice to the Siberian sector of the Arctic. Then we stop the engines and let the Polarstern drift with the sea ice.§By November the vessel will be encased in solid sea ice, temperatures will plunge to as low as -50C and the darkness of polar night will set in. In these hostile conditions, the scientists will set up an extensive network of research stations, in some cases travelling 50km from the vessel on snow mobiles.Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science＊s () annual meeting in Boston on Sunday, Rex outlined new details of the 50m (?42m) project, which will involve 50 institutions from 14 countries including the UK, US and Russia. The teams will investigate how rapid warming in the Arctic is altering the polar vortex. Scientists anticipate that as the temperature contrast between low and high latitudes reduces, strong circular winds around the pole will shift to lighter, more meandering patterns. This will allow ※more frequent and cold air outbreaks from the Arctic§, causing extreme cold spells on the east coast of the US and parts of Europe.The scientists will release hundreds of helium balloons carrying sensors to take atmospheric measurements of super-cooled water in clouds, a unique Arctic phenomenon. Water droplets in the clouds reach temperatures as low as -10C without freezing, partly due to the pristine Arctic air, which is low in aerosols that would usually seed the formation of ice crystals in such temperatures. Increasing industrial activity in the Arctic could radically alter this process, Rex said. The  predicts that 20 years from now, 25% of container shipping from Asia to Europe will go through the Arctic rather than through the Suez canal.Mission scientists who will work onboard the Polarstern in three-month rotations will also investigate life in melt ponds, small lakes that form on the ice in spring. ※Once the sea ice breaks up in spring, there are huge algal blooms and within a few days the ocean is green,§ said Rex. ※Somehow the phytoplankton and the krill survives under the ice, it＊s doing something in mid-winter under the ice.§What happens in the Arctic has a major impact on the weather in northern Europe and North America. Yet the forces at work are not well understood, because gaining access to the region to carry out ground-based studies is so difficult, limiting the accuracy of forecasting and leaving major gaps in what climate models can explain.Recorded levels of Arctic sea ice, , show a much faster rate of decline than computer simulations predict, for instance.※There are many many really small-scale processes which affect the climate on a regional and global scale in the Arctic which we can＊t observe from a satellite,§ said Rex.As the polar winter turns to spring, the Polarstern will approach the Fram Strait, the body of water between Greenland and Svalbard where Nansen＊s vessel eventually made its exit into open water. ※Only the Fram has done this before,§ said Rex.The Mosaic team believe the latest mission, while less perilous, could have a similarly revolutionary impact on the scientific understanding of the Arctic.Matthew Shupe, a scientist at the University of Colorado who is co-leading the mission, said: ※[The Fram] was groundbreaking in its era and frankly in it＊s own way Mosaic will be in this era. It will be this very momentous step forward.§ "																																																			
" and  have joined conservationists and charities asking officials in Borneo to reconsider a bridge that threatens one of the last sanctuaries of the rare pygmy elephant.There are now just 1,500 of the world＊s smallest pachyderm, according to WWF, and about 300 of them make their home in the 26,000-hectare Kinabatangan  Sanctuary, in the state of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. But construction teams have begun preparatory work for a bridge that will cross the Kinabatangan river which weaves through the region. The area is also home to critically endangered orangutans, proboscis monkeys, clouded leopards, gibbons, sun bears, pangolins and thousands of other jungle species, and hosts a thriving eco-tourism industry where travellers can view wildlife from boats on the river or while hiking into the forests.Attenborough, known globally for his wildlife documentaries and conservation work, rarely intervenes in domestic planning issues. But he has written to the chief minister of the region, Musa Aman, arguing that the plan will harm already embattled wildlife populations and create a new barrier for migrating Bornean elephants. Listed as endangered by the IUCN, they require large areas of habitat for foraging and many fear that the increasingly fragmented populations will lead to genetic problems.※I have had many encounters with the magnificent and unique species with which your state is blessed,§ Attenborough wrote. ※If this construction is allowed to go ahead, I am left in no doubt that the bridge will have significant negative effects on the region＊s wildlife, the Kinabatangan＊s thriving tourism industry and on the image of Sabah as a whole.§Sabah and the Kinabatangan rainforest have been transformed over the past few decades. Palm oil plantations have fractured much of the habitat, forcing species into ever-smaller pockets of forest. Already, the Bornean rhino (a subspecies of the Sumatra) has vanished from Sabah entirely. Conservationists fear the Bornean pygmy elephant could be next. The bridge would span 350 metres across the Kinabatangan river, connecting the village of Sukau, of around 2,000 people, to Litang and Tomanggong. It would be funded by the federal government. The project would also require paving a dirt road, bringing more traffic to the area. Many local people are lobbying for the bridge, arguing it will cut down journey times and allow much faster access to the nearest hospital. For remote villages, it would replace a private ferry, which is the only way for them to cross the river and can require several hours of waiting. Local councilman Saddi Abdul Rahman argues that his constituents require the infrastructure update and that it won＊t harm the local wildlife. ※We are concerned about our wildlife but we also cannot ignore the needs of people there,§ Saddi . As well as the controversial bridge, there are plans for a 1km-long viaduct nearby, which would raise traffic above the forest. He believes this would allow free passage beneath for elephants and other species and . However, conservationists cite another bridge on the Kinabatangan as proof that the latest plans would cause irreversible damage. ※The existing road and bridge at Batu Putih has acted as a barrier to wildlife movement, in particular dividing the populations of elephants on each side,§ biologist Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy wrote in a letter opposing the Sukau bridge. ※This example raises justifiable concern about the current proposal.§ Meanwhile, conservationists say they have  that wildlife ever uses other viaducts built in mainland Malaysia. has shown that road building and new infrastructure leads to drastic increases in deforestation and wildlife poaching. Wildlife presenter Steve Backshall has added his voice to the campaign against the Sukau bridge. He and his wife, Helen Glover, the Olympic champion rower, are currently  non-stop for 125 miles in the UK to raise funds for the World Land Trust, which has purchased several wildlife corridors in the area to enable orangutans and elephants to move freely.※My concerns about the bridge in the Kinabatangan are that it would provide easier access into forests that will then be more accessible for logging, poaching, slash-and-burn agriculture and palm oil plantations,§ said Backshall. ※These fragile forests are on a knife-edge 每 any tiny negative influence could have brutal effects.§※I＊ve been travelling to the Kinabatangan for 25 years, and I＊ve seen how it is changing. The gallery forest that flanks the river is critical as a wildlife corridor between existing forest reserves, and it＊s frightening how close to the river the plantations are now getting. The river forests need to remain unbroken, to allow the dispersal and free movement of iconic species like orangutans and pygmy elephants. I can＊t think of anywhere on the planet where so much can be achieved through the purchase of such small areas of land.§Opposition to the bridge has also come from the Sime Darby Foundation (YSD), the charitable arm of one of the world＊s largest palm oil producers, which has said it  in Sukau if the plan goes ahead. YSD has given more than ?15m to conservation efforts in Sabah and is working on a programme with Nestl谷 to reforest 2,400 hectares. There have been several suggestions for an alternative to the Sukau bridge, including building one downstream, where it would be less damaging to the local ecosystem, or upgrading existing roads and infrastructure. Plans have been stalled for a year as debate has raged. Now the public is awaiting an official environmental impact assessment, although construction machines have already started moving dirt. Conservationists fear that their calls may be too late, and that politicians will prioritise development over wildlife. Attenborough concluded in his letter: ※I strongly believe that Borneo is one of the most unique and biodiverse places on this planet, and that the world＊s remaining wild spaces provide more than ecological services and opportunities for economic development; they also provide deep spiritual nourishment for ourselves and future generations of Sabahans and visitors alike.§"																																																			
"The embattled  could face yet more severe coral bleaching in the coming month, with areas badly hit by last year＊s event at risk of death.Images taken by local divers last week and shared exclusively with the Guardian by the Australian Marine Conservation Society show newly bleached corals discovered near Palm Island.Most of the Great Barrier Reef has been placed on red alert for coral bleaching for the coming month by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  unusually warm waters off eastern Australia after an extreme heatwave just over a week ago saw land temperatures reach above 47C in parts of the country.According to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, sea surface temperatures from Cape Tribulation to Townsville have been up to 2C higher than normal for the time of year for more than a month.The NOAA Coral Reef Watch＊s forecast for the next four weeks has placed an even higher level alert on parts of the far northern, northern and central reef, indicating mortality is likely.Corals south of Cairns, in the Whitsundays and parts of the far northern reef that were badly hit by last year＊s mass bleaching event are at fatal risk.Imogen Zethoven, the Great Barrier Reef＊s campaign director for the AMCS, said the projections for the next four weeks, plus evidence of new coral bleaching, were ※extremely concerning§.The bleaching that occurred over eight to nine months of last year was the worst-ever on record for the Great Barrier Reef, with as much as 85% of coral between Cape York and Lizard Island dying. Twenty-two per cent of corals over the entire reef are dead.Zethoven pointed to projections by NOAA that severe bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef would occur annually by 2043 if nothing was done to reduce emissions.※The reef will be gone before annual severe bleaching,§ she said. ※It won＊t survive even biennial bleaching.§The  by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in June last year was a ※cynical rebadging exercise§ undercut by its support for fossil fuel initiatives such as Adani＊s Carmicheal coalmine ※that will spell catastrophe for the reef§, Zethoven said.※There＊s no doubt about that anymore,§ she said. ※They know what they are doing and they should come clean with the Australian public that they have no interest in the long-term survival of the Great Barrier Reef.※To the average person on the street, that＊s what it looks like. And if the government thinks that＊s not the case, they＊re out of touch.§In December last year the government＊s Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund  to $1bn loan for its Carmicheal coalmine and rail project in central Queensland, which could produce 60m tons of coal annually for 60 years.Warmer ocean temperatures brought about by climate change is a key factor in coral bleaching. Polling suggests that  believe the reef＊s condition should be declared a national emergency.Zethoven said the government had made ※a very deliberate decision to go down the coal road§, despite it jeopardising the reef＊s future prospects as well as the 70,000 jobs in regional  that depend on it.John Rumney, a diving operator based in Port Douglas, said the ※commercial advantage§ to saving the reef went beyond jobs. Much of coastal Queensland was ※majorly invested§ in reef tourism, he said.The federal government＊s measures to save the reef were hypocrisy and lip service, he said, when it was simultaneously ※actively supporting the cause of the cancer 每 the worst cause§.※It＊s immoral that those of us who are making our living from a healthy environment are paying taxes to subsidise infrastructure that＊s going to cause climate change in a major way for the next 50 years,§ he said. ※If this all goes ahead, we＊re basically dooming our tourism industry.§Rumney said he had seen new and extensive bleaching of corals from Cairns to Townsville.※There are definite large areas of mortality. It＊s just the next depressing moment. Before, the reef has bleached and recovered but now we＊re talking about how often is it bleaching and what percentage is left.§Areas that suffered in last year＊s event were now less resilient and there seemed to be less coral strong enough to spawn.Climate change-induced mass bleaching increasingly resembled a catastrophe the reef would be unable to recover from, he said.※It＊s weaker, just like humans,§ Rumney said. ※If you＊re already down and out with a cold or cancer, you＊re less resilient 每 the next thing that comes along is going to knock you back more.※It＊s the continual onslaught that will eventually kill the reef.§"																																																			
"Several times each week I take vegetable peelings from the kitchen to the three compost recycling bins at the bottom of the garden. Even in winter, they are hotbeds of biodiversity.Today, as I lift the lid of the newest bin, I am greeted by a blizzard of minute  () that have bred in the film of water covering decaying garden weeds and autumn leaves. Despite their putrid surroundings, these are beautiful insects, with silky wings clothed in fine white hairs, like a glamorous ermine coat. This sudden flood of winter sunshine is their first experience of daylight. They wander around the rim of their bin, disoriented, testing their wings. A sudden shower of carrot and potato peelings, broccoli stems and banana skins sends some into the air, to be whisked away by the chill spring wind; the rest are condemned to a few more days in dank darkness.The middle bin is full. Lifting the lid reveals a layer of exquisite glassy fungal threads, each topped with a sporangium resembling a polished bead of jet: it＊s pin , . There is a sweet smell of fungal decay and rotting orange peel, with the merest hint of alcoholic fermentation.Scores of tiger-striped brandling worms () are crawling over the surface, driven to the upper layers today by the sun-warmed bin and the heat of composting at its core.There are also five species of slug. Confined to recycling work, they are allies in the garden. I might not feel so benevolent when spring comes and their attention turns to seedlings.Opening the final bin, now in the last stages of decomposition and quite dry, reveals legions of armoured woodlice. A centipede scuttles away, its flat, articulated, body weaving through the narrowest gaps, a needle-jawed predator in this constantly changing pyramid of life.The compost that crumbles between my fingers has the consistency of coarse peat, ready to dig into the garden. Thirty years of recycling by a workforce of fungi, bacteria and millions of invertebrate herbivores, has turned this sandy plot into fertile, moisture-retentive, soil that provides fruit and vegetables for two-thirds of the year."																																																			
"An air quality report that was not published by  while he was mayor of London demonstrates that 433 schools in the capital are located in areas that exceed EU limits for nitrogen dioxide pollution 每 and that four-fifths of those are in deprived areas.The report, , said that in 2010, 433 of the city＊s 1,777 primary schools were in areas where pollution breached the EU limits for NO2. Of those, 83% were considered deprived schools, with more than 40% of pupils on free school meals.A spokeswoman for Johnson＊s successor, , said the new mayor could not understand why the research had not been published when it was completed more than two-and-a-half years ago.Khan＊s spokeswoman said: ※This shocking report reveals a snapshot of the true ?impact that our polluted air has on some of London＊s most vulnerable communities. It is difficult to understand why the last mayoralty decided to cover it up and not fully release it in 2013 每 they clearly didn＊t want Londoners to know the dire state of pollution in the capital. ※The mayor is fully committed to cleaning up our air and protecting Londoners＊ health and is shocked to learn that important scientific evidence like this have been locked and ignored at City Hall.§The mayor now plans to officially publish the report.Khan has been keen to  in London. In the first week after his election he said Johnson had turned the city into a ※laughing stock§ on air pollution by being too slow to act on the issue, and said he would be expanding the size of the former mayor＊s planned clean air zone to the north and south circular roads.※,§ said Simon Birkett, founder and director of Clean Air in London. ※Sadiq Khan is coming to London＊s rescue in the nick of time. We need a clean air revolution.§The research was commissioned by the Greater  authority in early 2013 from the independent consultancy Aether, and completed in September of the same year. Aether has told the Guardian that it was never published.Of the 1,344 schools located in areas below the pollution limit, less than a fifth were in deprived areas. Although these inequalities were forecast to come down by 2020, the study＊s authors, Katie King and Sean Healy, wrote that there was ※still a clear disparity between deprived and non-deprived schools§.Explaining the reason why that was the case, King and Healy wrote: ※A possible explanation for the general trend may be the link between lower house prices, and hence poorer households, and proximity to main roads such as the M4, inner ring roads and radial roads. Roads are a very significant source of NO2 emissions in London.§Their data also showed that in 2010, Londoners living in the city＊s most deprived areas, including the eastern boroughs of Newham, Hackney and Tower Hamlets, were on average more exposed to poor air quality than those in more affluent areas. In half of the most deprived 10% of areas of London the air was in breach of EU limits on NO2, compared with 1% of in the richest 10% of areas. The study estimated that nearly half a million under-19s lived in areas that breached NO2 limits. A further 1.3 million under-19s lived in close proximity to those areas with dirty air.Nitrogen dioxide is a toxic gas produced by diesel vehicles that is linked to respiratory problems. Its levels are increasingly in focus after Volkswagen was found by US authorities to have cheated emissions lab tests.Subsequent research in the UK and elsewhere has also confirmed that a wide range of cars on the road emit more nitrogen dioxide than suggested by lab tests, meaning that pollution levels in or near major roads are higher than had been hoped.More than  die early from illegal levels of NO2.

"veryone knows that horror story of wrapping a tampon up in toilet roll and trying to smuggle it out your friend＊s bathroom,§ says Martha Silcott, inventor of , a biodegradable bag designed to make it easier for women to bin their tampons.Silcott, a former City worker turned entrepreneur, surveyed hundreds of women and girls before launching her product on something we don＊t usually talk about: the monthly, often messy matter of getting rid of used tampons. She found 40% chose to bin, 60% were flushers. My own quick poll of colleagues in the office and friends on WhatsApp also revealed divided opinion. While some said they flush freely, others were fiercely anti-flush (one friend simply messaged ????), and a few didn＊t realise flushing tampons was even possible. There are  women using tampons in the UK, and the average woman will use roughly  tampons in her lifetime. Yet on sites such as  and  there are still entire threads trying to get to the bottom of how best to dispose of them.Neil Dhot, head of corporate affairs at water utility company , sets things straight: ※toilets are only for poo, pee and (toilet) paper.§ Tampons expand in water which means they can block toilets as well as sewers by getting stuck to other things like twigs or rubbish. Sewer blocks are nasty and expensive to fix, ultimately adding costs to water and sewerage bills. Water UK estimates it spends ?90m a year clearing blocked sewers. Plus there＊s the danger that, especially during floods, tampons sent into the sewage system can end up in rivers . Wary not to come across like the period police, Dhot stresses: ※we don＊t in any way want to sound preachy to women about what they should and shouldn＊t do ... but we just want people to be aware that our actions in the spur of the moment can unfortunately have unintended consequences.§ Sanitary products generally feature a symbol somewhere on their packaging illustrating correct disposal. Boots own brand tampons tell consumers to wrap them in a sanitary disposal bag and put them in household waste. A spokesperson for Tampax says its packaging also informs consumers about the right disposal of the used tampon (not to flush). It was sitting on the toilet having given up flushing and feeling frustrated with the ※loo roll wrap§ technique that Silcott came up with the idea of Fab Little Bag - a small opaque bag that can be used with one hand and sealed so the tampon is stored securely.Made from 35% organic material (currently sugar cane waste), she says the bag will biodegrade in 12-18 months, which was important for her ※because the last thing this world needs is more plastic.§ The tampon inside will decompose according to its own criteria (this can take around ) but Silcott dreams of finding a chemical to coat the inside of the bags with which would ※eat§ the tampon. She says most people are open to change when they realise the impacts of flushing tampons, but that the awkward alternatives - wrapping the tampon in toilet roll or tying it up in a flimsy non-biodegradable transparent nappy sack - aren＊t especially appealing. Silcott hopes her bag will convert flushers to binning.Launched in November last year, the bags feature in subscription boxes such as Pink Parcel, Sanitary Owl and Dollibox and are sold in Waitrose, Wholefoods and Ocado. Costing ?2.99 for 20 bags, Silcott admits the product won＊t be for everyone: ※Some people will not want to spend a penny more on periods, and I understand that.§ But she believes that for others the bags will make periods that little less painful, with hopes for the future of taking the idea to developing countries where sanitation is poor and the stigma around periods a challenge.Tampons themselves are problematic from a sustainability perspective. The production process requires turning wood pulp into soft, cotton-like fibres which is resource and chemical intensive, while plastic applicators linger in landfills.There are more environmentally friendly options such as the organic cotton tampons  and alternatives such as  and the , but these remain niche."																																																			
"Australia＊s financial regulator has warned that climate change poses a material risk to the entire financial system, and has urged companies to start adapting.Geoff Summerhayes, from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, says it is unsafe for companies to ignore the risks of climate change just because there is some uncertainty, or ※even some controversy§, about the policy outlook.Speaking at the Insurance Council of Australia＊s annual forum in Sydney, Summerhayes said  and a transition risk for Australian companies.He said the transition risks stemmed from coming changes in policy, law, markets, technology and prices that were part of ※the now-agreed transition to a low-carbon economy§.Summerhayes said Apra wanted companies to start incorporating sophisticated ※scenario-based analysis§ of climate risks into their business outlooks.He said Apra intended to start running stress tests of the financial system to see if it would survive various adverse climate shocks.※While climate risks have been broadly recognised, they have often been seen as a future problem or a non-financial problem,§ he told the audience on Friday.※The key point I want to make today, and that Apra wants to be explicit about, is that this is no longer the case. ※Some climate risks are distinctly ＆financial＊ in nature. Many of these risks are foreseeable, material and actionable now. Climate risks also have potential system-wide implications that Apra and other regulators here and abroad are paying much closer attention to,§ he said.※It could be the case that, just as we would expect to see more sophisticated scenario-based analysis of climate risks at the firm level, we look at these risks as part of our system-wide stress testing.§His warning comes after a bruising fortnight in federal parliament, during which the government and its opponents argued about Australia＊s energy policy. The Coalition is intent on making energy policy a point of sharp partisan difference this year.Last week, that a decade of partisan politics and finger-pointing had destroyed investor confidence in Australia＊s energy sector.Summerhayes pointed to the Paris Climate Agreement, , as a significant policy moment for all governments.He said it provided an ※unmistakable signal§ about the future direction of policy and adjustments that companies, markets and economies ※will need to make§.He said all Apra-regulated entities would need to adapt to the coming regulatory changes.※I think the days of viewing climate change within a purely ethical, environmental or long-term frame have passed,§ he said.※More and more, the conversations we are having are about the practical realities and consequences of a changing climate.※We＊re now at the stage of the collective effort, calibration and creativity to turn ambition into reality. What happens next isn＊t just a matter for rocket scientists 每 but also humble prudential regulators.§Summerhayes, , said businesses risked making life more difficult for themselves if they believed certain climate mitigation policies might be delayed or fail to eventuate, and used that as an excuse not to prepare themselves.※It may be that the latter scenario could make risks greater and more abrupt,§ he said.※This is because there could be either sharper, more significant policy changes and market adjustments down the track, or the physical impacts of climate change could become more severe, more likely and more unpredictable.※Like all risks, it is better they are explicitly considered and managed as appropriate, rather than simply ignored or neglected.§Kate MacKenzie, from the Climate Institute, welcomed Summerhayes＊ speech.※It＊s reassuring to see that Australia＊s prudential supervisor understands that, regardless of controversy in the political realm, climate change is a real and rapidly evolving risk for our financial sector and broader economy,§ she told Guardian Australia.※His speech acknowledges many of the key financial implications of climate change which we＊ve been researching and communicating for the past few years. ※He specifically mentioned superannuation funds＊ exposure to climate risk through their portfolios, and banks via their loan books, including via physical impacts to houses on their mortgage books. ※Speeches are an important tool for Apra to communicate its concerns and priorities, so this sends a clear signal to all Australian banks, insurers and superannuation funds that they should be considering climate risk.§"																																																			
"he rush hour is not a good time to be out and about on the A472 as lorry after lorry climbs out of the south  valley town of Crumlin and heads up and over towards Pontypool.※It＊s pretty terrible,§ said Deanna Harwick, a mother of two young children, who lives in a terrace lining one side of the heaving road. ※We can＊t have the windows open because of the fumes so in the summer the house feels pretty airless. I don＊t let the children play outside, not just because of the risk of a road accident but because of the damage the air may cause to their health. I＊ve been here 10 years and I＊m keen to move.§ Harwick＊s concerns are backed by solid evidence. Just up the road from her front door a monitor records levels of nitrogen dioxide. According to , the levels here are the highest recorded in the UK outside London (the levels are  in central London). The health problems caused by air pollution were highlighted last week in a report from the World Health Organisation that documented pollution levels in more than 3,000 cities around the world. It found that particulate pollution has  with the worst of the problem in developing countries. In the UK, experts believe that .In Crumlin, the bad air hotspot is caused by something of a perfect storm. The road is a main cross route between two valleys and so is always busy with local traffic. It is also used by commuters travelling to Newport and Cardiff. Most significantly, it is a favourite cut-through for lorry drivers keen to avoid the M4, which is often congested, and the Severn Bridge tolls (?19.80 for HGVs). The geography of this spot in Caerphilly county exacerbates the problem. Even if the road happens to be clear, the steep hill slows the trucks down to a crawl. And the spot is hemmed in by the terrace on one side and a hill on the other so that, especially on a still day, the fumes linger.George Powell, 70, who has lived here for 15 years, has given up trying to clear the black residue that clings to his front door. ※It＊s horrible the way it gathers there. I＊ve installed double glazing against the noise but the fumes leave your eyes streaming. I＊ve got grandchildren. We let them play out the back 每 there＊s woods and a stream there 每 but never on the front.§ His neighbour, Clive Dodd, a retired plasterer aged 68 who has lived on the road for 12 years, said he found himself getting out of breath now as he walked up the hill. ※I didn＊t used to have a problem. I do now and I blame the road. I think they should ban HGVs and vans. That would sort it.§ There may be solid evidence about the levels of nitrogen dioxide but what effect the road has on people＊s health here is harder to quantify. According to , 314,000 people have asthma in Wales, including 59,000 children 每 almost one child in 10.  said the percentage of patients registered with their GP for asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) was greater than in England 每 and there had been a slight increase in recent years. A  shows that the chance of dying from asthma is higher than the UK average in Caerphilly but, actually, the rates are slightly greater in the neighbouring boroughs of Blaenau Gwent and Torfaen. There are no street-level statistics that will show if the problems on the A472 are having an impact on residents＊ health, but staff at the Mayberry pharmacy in Crumlin say they are noticing an increase in the number of people, particularly children, who need inhalers. However, fumes from lorries cannot be blamed for all of the area＊s respiratory problems 每 smoking and heavy industry remain a major cause of public health problems in the south Wales valleys. Caerphilly council and the Welsh government have tried to make improvements, investing in a new road layout. A council spokesperson said the monitor had been installed to help it establish what was happening.※We are aware of the high air-quality readings in this area and have installed the air-quality monitor specifically to look at trends in air-quality data,§ the spokesperson said. ※The area has been designated as an  (AQMA) and the council is working alongside key stakeholders to look at options to improve the air quality.§ It is possible there are more polluted places in the country that don＊t have a monitor.The Wales Green party said the solution was improving public transport.Spokesperson  said: ※Air pollution knows no borders and tough limits have been set by the EU to tackle this growing problem. Air pollution is a well-known killer. ※The remedy is to invest in a decent public transport network, reopen smaller train stations and give people a fast, clean and affordable way to get around.§ She said a plan to build a  每 which includes heavy rail, light rail and buses working together 每 in south-east Wales had been on the drawing board for years. ※Yet the Welsh government is set on building more roads like the that will bring more harmful pollution and more congestion.§ Alan Heaps, who runs a woodwork business from his house on the A472, agreed that radical action was needed. ※The problem is they＊d have to knock this terrace down to make a bigger road or just ban lorries completely. Both would cost millions. And I don＊t think they＊ll spend millions here. We＊re stuck with the problem.§"																																																			
"The British government has been accused of trying to secretly undermine new EU air pollution targets in favour of big business, as leaked papers reveal that Tory MEPs were told to support a ※get-out clause§ in proposed laws.Legislation designed to force member states to strictly limit emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ammonia by 2030 is being scrutinised in Brussels.It is recognised by ministers that air pollution is estimated to reduce life expectancy of everyone in the UK by an average of six months, which is equivalent to 50,000 deaths a year.However, it has emerged that the junior environment minister  has advised Tory MEPs that the government does not believe the proposed ceilings on emissions are ※proportionate, deliverable and evidence-based and do not impact disproportionately on any one sector§.In a leaked information note, Stewart insisted that Tory MEPs support an amendment that would give Britain ※flexibility§ and allow businesses to ※adjust their inventory§ if the country looks on track to breach targets because particular sectors are emitting more than expected.The Liberal Democrat MEP for South East England, Catherine Bearder, said the move fundamentally weakened the EU legislation, and allowed the government to ignore the damage done by high-emitting sectors, such as the car industry.She said: ※It seems no lessons have been learned from the dieselgate scandal. This shameful get-out clause could allow authorities to turn a blind eye while carmakers exceed EU pollution limits all over again. The UK government must enforce the rules to tackle deadly pollution, instead of secretly trying to water them down.§The revelation comes as independent analysis by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), a Brussels-based coalition of environmental charities, found that weaker pollution limits being pushed for by the government will lead to about 11,000 extra deaths in the UK by 2030, and an extra 136,000 across .About 29,000 deaths in the UK are currently hastened by inhalation of minute particles of oily soot emitted by all petrol engines and an estimated 23,500 by the invisible but toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO) discharged by diesel engines.On Thursday the publication of data from more than  found that outdoor air pollution had grown 8% globally in the past five years, with billions of people around the world now exposed to dangerous air.Of 52 UK towns and cities included in the UN database, Port Talbot in south Wales, a hub for the UK steel industry, is the most polluted, ahead of London, Glasgow, Southampton and Leeds. The cleanest UK city in the WHO list is Inverness, followed by Bournemouth, Newcastle and Sunderland.A spokesman for the environment department said the amendment to the 2030 national ceilings directive was designed to allow for scientific developments that could not have been foreseen when the ceilings were set. The department said the current proposals meant that member states would be unfairly penalised if there were scientific developments which ※change the evidence base upon which ceilings are set§.The spokesman said: ※Tackling air pollution is a priority for this government and we are working with EU partners to agree ambitious and realistic emission limits for key air pollutants from 2030.※It is important these limits are based on the best available evidence and member states are not penalised by any new and unforeseen developments in the way emissions are calculated, which could hamper our ability to agree ambitious limits that will lead to long-term improvements in air quality.§"																																																			
"The heatwave that engulfed southeastern Australia at the end of last week has seen heat records continue to tumble.On Saturday 11 February, as  suffered through the heatwave＊s peak, temperatures soared to 47⊥ in Richmond, 50km northwest of Sydney, while 87 bushfires raged across the state, amid catastrophic fire conditions.On that day, most of NSW experienced temperatures at least 12C above normal for this time of year. In White Cliffs, the overnight minimum was 34.2, a new record for the state＊s .On Friday, the average maximum temperature right across NSW hit 42.4, beating the previous February record of 42.0. The new record stood for all of 24 hours before it was smashed again on Saturday, as the whole state averaged 44.0 at its peak. At this time, NSW was the hottest place on earth.A degree or two here or there might not sound like much, but to put it in cricketing parlance, those temperature records are the equivalent of a modern-day test batsman retiring with an average of over 100 每 the feat of outdoing Don Bradman＊s fabled 99.94 每 and would undoubtedly be front-page news.And still the records continue to fall. Mungindi, on the border of NSW and Queensland, broke the Australian record of 50 days in a row above 35, set just four years ago at Bourke airport, with the new record now at 52 days.Meanwhile, two days after that sweltering Saturday we woke to find the fires ignited during the heatwave , with the small town of Uarbry, east of Dunedoo, .This heatwave is all the more noteworthy when we consider that the  and the conditions that ordinarily influence our weather are firmly in neutral. This means we should expect average, not sweltering, temperatures.Since Christmas, much of eastern Australia has been in a flux of extreme temperatures. This increased frequency of heatwaves shows a , which is set to continue as the human influence on the climate deepens.It is all part of a rapid warming trend that over the past decade has seen new heat records in Australia outnumber new cold records by Let＊s be clear, this is not natural. Climate scientists have long been saying that we would feel the impacts of human-caused climate change in heat records first, before noticing the upward swing in average temperatures (although that is ). This heatwave is simply the latest example.What＊s more, in just a few decades＊ time, summer conditions like these will be .The useful thing scientifically about heatwaves is that we can estimate the role that climate change plays in these individual events. This is a relatively new field known as ※event attribution§, which has .Using the , we looked at the role of human-induced climate change in this latest heatwave, as we have for ?previously.We compared the likelihood of such a heatwave in model simulations that factor in human greenhouse gas emissions, compared with simulations in which there is no such human influence. Since 2017 has only just begun, we used model runs representing 2014, which was similarly an El Ni?o-neutral year, while also experiencing similar levels of human influence on the climate.Based on this analysis, we found that heatwaves at least as hot as this one are now twice as likely to occur. In the current climate, a heatwave of this severity and extent occurs, on average, once every 120 years, so is still quite rare. However, without human-induced climate change, this heatwave would only occur once every 240 years.In other words, the waiting time for the recent east Australian heatwave has halved. As climate change worsens in the coming decades, the waiting time will reduce even further.Our results show very clearly the influence of climate change on this heatwave event.

"Shipping companies are under pressure to phase out use of heavy fuels ahead of a potential ban on their use in the  in the coming years.The International Maritime Organisation has approved an environmental review of the use of heavy fuel oil (HFO) by ships in the Arctic. Already banned in Antarctica, HFO is a dense and viscous byproduct of other fuel refining processes. Oil spills or leaks would be severely toxic, and devastating to flora, fauna and indigenous communities because of the long time the sludge takes to break down in cold water. The risks to fragile Arctic ecosystems could soar as more polar sea lanes become accessible because of climate change. A Canadian proposal unanimously adopted at the IMO＊s marine environmental protection committee last Friday mandates a review of mitigating measures for HFO use, to begin in April 2018. No calls for a ban on HFOs have been formally put on the agenda but ※at this early stage, nothing can be ruled in or out,§ an IMO spokesperson said.※I＊m fairly sure a ban will happen one day,§ said Peter Hinchliffe, the secretary-general of the International Chamber of Shipping told the Guardian. ※We won＊t be opposing it but our role [in the IMO] is to make sure we are not causing a disproportionate disadvantage to ships that use HFOs in the Arctic today.§More than 850 ships operating in the Arctic today are thought to use HFOs, said Dr Sian Prior, lead advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance, and these represent around three-quarters of total Arctic ship fuel use. The majority are flagged to non-Arctic nations such as Panama, Liberia, Singapore and the Marshall Islands.But as global warming melts new shipping lanes, even larger ships from outside the Arctic are expected to steer through the Polar north in search of shorter journey times, increasing the risk of accidents. In March, Arctic sea ice extent fell to  since records began 38 years ago.The shipping industry has  to cut the sulphur content of marine fuels to 0.5% by 2020. ※It will be extremely difficult to get HFOs with sulphur content as low as 0.5%. Most ships will turn to lighter fuels 每 diesel essentially 每 and that means that imposing an Arctic ban on HFOs may have a very limited life as few ships are likely to go there burning HFOs,§ said Hinchliffe.Rune Thomas Ege, a spokesman for the Norwegian expedition tour operator, , said that the new Arctic waterways opening up were pulling in inexperienced crews in unsuitable ships, and stoking concerns. ※HFOs should already have been banned in the Arctic 每 as they has been in Antarctica,§ he said.  Next year, Hurtigruten says it will launch the world＊s first hybrid battery-powered cruise ship, the MS Roald Amundsen, to be followed by the MS Fridtjof Nansen in 2019. Hinchliffe said while the idea of battery-powered fleets was ※not pie in the sky§, it would be inappropriate for tankers needing to travel thousands of miles. Other alternatives were in the works, he suggested.  ※We don＊t yet have a hydrogen-powered ship but I expect experimentation to take place,§ he said. ※Our holy grail is to find a carbon-free fuel but there isn＊t one at the moment. I would hope that by 2030 we will have a very clear indication of what the fuel is likely to be.§Aslak Ross, the head of marine standards at Maersk Line, told the Guardian that fuels which were both low-sulphur and low-carbon could enter the world market ※sooner than many expect§. ※This is one of the reasons we have decided not to invest in ＆scrubbers＊, not least due to their negative impact on the vessel＊s energy efficiency,§ he said.Scrubbing technology allows ships to chemically filter and cleanse their existing HFO blends and avoid the trouble and expense of switching to lighter distillate fuels such as diesel, liquefied natural gas or, potentially, ethanol. But scrubbers are  by industry analysts because they cost $3-5m to fit per vessel, and a lack of shipyards would prevent a retrofit taking place among the world＊s fleet by 2020, when the new sulphur standard takes effect.Many environmentalists and shipowners alike see scrubbers as a way of ensuring the survival of highly polluting fuels at a time when rapid transition is needed.  are in service around the world."																																																			
"A US appeals court has debated whether or not a monkey can own the copyright to a selfie, while the photographer whose camera captured the famous image watched a livestream of the proceedings from his home in the UK.David Slater could not afford the air fare to San Francisco to attend the hearing on Wednesday. Nor can he afford to replace his broken camera equipment, or pay the attorney who has been defending him since the crested black macaque , and is exploring other ways to earn an income.The story of the monkey selfie began in 2011, when Slater traveled to Sulawesi, Indonesia, and spent several days following and . Slater has  that the selfies were the result of his ingenuity in coaxing the monkeys into pressing the shutter while looking into the lens, after he struggled to get them to keep their eyes open for a wide-angle close-up.※It wasn＊t serendipitous monkey behavior,§ he said. ※It required a lot of knowledge on my behalf, a lot of perseverance, sweat and anguish, and all that stuff.§The photographs became popular, and Slater said that he earned a few thousand pounds 每 enough to cover the cost of the trip to Indonesia. But the images became the subject of a complicated legal , when Slater asked the blog Techdirt and Wikipedia to stop using them without permission.The websites refused, with Wikipedia claiming that the photograph was uncopyrightable because the monkey was the actual creator of the image. The US Copyright Office subsequently  that animals cannot own copyrights.※Every photographer dreams of a photograph like this,§ Slater said of the image of a primate grinning toothily into the lens. ※If everybody gave me a pound for every time they used [the photograph], I＊d probably have ?40m in my pocket. The proceeds from these photographs should have me comfortable now, and I＊m not.§Making a living as a freelancer is tough for any photographer, but for Slater, economic stability was once tantalizingly within reach.Instead, he is struggling to get by. ※I＊m trying to become a tennis coach,§ Slater said by phone on Wednesday from his home in Chepstow, Wales. ※I＊m even thinking about doing dog walking. I don＊t make enough money to pay income tax.§Slater has been embroiled in years of arcane legal wrangling over the nature of authorship, and said that he is ※seriously on the verge of packing it all in§.In 2015, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) filed a , which it identified as a six-year-old male named Naruto, claiming that the animal was the rightful owner of the copyright. A judge ruled against Peta in 2016, saying that animals were not covered by the Copyright Act. Peta appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals, which heard oral arguments on Wednesday.Among the points of contention were whether Peta has a close enough relationship to Naruto to represent it in court, the value of providing written notice of a copyright claim to a community of macaques, and whether Naruto is actually harmed by not being recognized as a copyright-holder.※There is no way to acquire or hold money. There is no loss as to reputation. There is not even any allegation that the copyright could have somehow benefited Naruto,§ said Judge N Randy Smith. ※What financial benefits apply to him? There＊s nothing.§ At one point, Judge Carlos Bea considered the question of how copyright passes to an author＊s heirs. ※In the world of Naruto, is there legitimacy and illegitimacy?§ Bea asked. ※Are Naruto＊s offspring ＆children＊, as defined by the statute?§For Slater, it was a painfully ironic line of questioning in light of his concerns for his own seven-year-old daughter and his continuing belief that the copyright is his. ※I can＊t afford to own a car. There＊s no camera equipment for her to inherit if I die tomorrow,§ he said. ※She should inherit this [copyright], but it＊s worthless.§ The lawyer for Slater＊s publisher, which is also a defendant, also raised the question of whether Peta has even identified the right monkey 每 something that Slater disputes. ※I know for a fact that [the monkey in the photograph] is a female and it＊s the wrong age,§ he said. ※I＊m bewildered at the American court system.

"As we well know,  that . It＊s only a matter of time before they rise from the dead and threaten to eat our brains. And so here we go again 每 American conservatives are denying the very existence of global warming.The claim is based on what can charitably be described as a white paper, written by fossil fuel-funded contrarians  and  along with James Wallace III. Two months ago, D＊Aleo and Wallace published  on the same website with fellow contrarian ; both papers aimed to undermine the EPA＊s Endangerment Finding. The Endangerment Finding concluded that the scientific research clearly shows that carbon pollution endangers public health and welfare via climate change impacts, and therefore according to the US Supreme Court, the . Conservatives who benefit from the fossil fuel status quo and oppose all climate policies have .Both papers are rife with flaws because they start from a desired conclusion 每 that the science underpinning Endangerment Finding is somehow wrong 每 and work backwards trying to support it. In , the contrarians try to undermine the accuracy of the global surface temperature record, which has been . They don＊t bother trying to hide their bias 每 the paper refers to ※Climate Alarmists§ and speaks of invalidating the Endangerment Finding. The paper itself has little scientific content. Using charts taken from climate denier blogs, the authors claim that every temperature record adjustment since the 1980s has been in the warming direction, which is simply false. As Zeke Hausfather pointed out, referencing work by Nick Stokes, roughly half of the adjustments have resulted in cooling and half in warming. Moreover, the net adjustment to the raw data actually r the long-term global warming trend:Additionally, a peer-reviewed study last year led by Hausfather  by showing that they bring the data in closer agreement with that from pristinely located temperature stations. The white paper also claims that the adjustments remove a ※cyclical pattern§ that appeared more clearly in early versions of the temperature record. As Hausfather told me, that＊s simply because we now have more data that better represent the planet as a whole:And of course  as well. Ice is melting, species are migrating, spring is arriving earlier, sea levels are rising, oceans are warming, humidity is rising, and so on. The contrarian white paper also references satellite estimates of the temperature of Earth＊s atmosphere 每 estimates that one group recently found are .The white paper authors admit that some adjustments to the raw data are necessary (for example, to correct for changes in instrumentation technology, time of observation, moving station locations, and so on), and they don＊t dispute the accuracy or necessity of any of the adjustments that climate scientists have made. Basically, because they don＊t like the end result of global warming, the authors assert that the adjustments must somehow be wrong, but fail to support that assertion with any real evidence. It＊s not worth the paper it＊s printed on.Predictably, a number of conservative media outlets like the Daily Caller and Climate Depot picked up on the white paper. The Daily Caller even went as far as to call it a ※peer-reviewed study.§ In a sense that＊s true 每 a number of other fossil fuel-funded contrarian scientists who are technically the authors＊ peers signed onto the paper. But of course that＊s really , not peer review; the white paper was not published in a peer-reviewed journal because it obviously would not withstand scrutiny by scientific experts.It＊s telling that these contrarian white paper efforts to undermine the established climate science supporting the EPA Endangerment Finding are so poor. They＊re forced to resort to conspiracy theories, implying that climate scientists from around the world are all falsifying data, adding a global warming signal to the temperature record that we also happen to see in nature and in satellites. As Hausfather put it:If this is the best contrarians can do, it＊s no wonder that  challenging the established climate science underpinning the EPA Endangerment Finding is a losing effort."																																																			
"aterpillars that can munch up plastic bags , fuelling excited speculation that this could one day eliminate global pollution from plastic waste. The chance discovery, initially made by a scientist and amateur beekeeper whose plastic bag had been eaten through by the moth caterpillars, was reported this week by researchers at Cambridge University and the Spanish National Research Council.How thoughtful of nature to provide bugs that eat our rubbish. Is this the end of landfill, turtles with plastic-congested stomachs, and trees adorned with tattered ribbons of shopping bags?Well, it＊s never that simple, is it? Attempts to commandeer nature to do our dirty work never seem to turn out as hoped, whether these take the form of planting trees to soak up carbon dioxide, or introducing invasive species for pest control, or using microorganisms to clean up oil spills. Remember the ? The toads were introduced in the 1930s to control crop pests but instead gorged themselves on other local wildlife and spread across the country.These creatures, the larvae of the greater wax moth (), can devour polyethylene, which along with the closely related polypropylene is the main type of plastic found in waste. But you＊d need an awful lot of them to make a significant dent on the plastic waste problem. The UK alone discards almost 2m tonnes of this stuff every year. At the rate of consumption reported by the researchers 每 one worm gets through about two milligrams of plastic a day 每 you＊d need billions of caterpillars eating constantly all year round to deal with that.Quite aside from how and where you＊d farm all these bugs, there＊s something about them that news reports have failed to mention. Wax moths, which are found throughout the world, are so-called because they eat wax. Specifically, they love to eat the wax from which bees make their honeycombs 每 and so . The two common species of wax moth, of which? is one, are thought to cause more than ?4m worth of damage annually in the United States?alone.With  from pesticides, habitat loss and predators, we might want to think twice about breeding one of their common airborne enemies in huge numbers 每 even if the intention was to somehow keep them in plastics-processing centres. The idea that if bees disappear then humankind will follow four years later, popularly misattributed to Albert Einstein, might be a touch hyperbolic. But without their pollinating assistance, crop cultivation would be in deep trouble.Polyethylene sits around in the environment because its molecules are so hard to break down. Ordinary soil microorganisms don＊t have the resources for it. These plastics are built up from the hydrocarbon molecules in oil, and ideally we＊d turn them back into oil after we had used them, regenerating a valuable substance rather than sacrificing it as waste. Chemists have been working long and hard to do that, using special catalysts to induce the chemical reactions. But it＊s tough, and only very recently have they started to see progress. It＊s precisely because wax is chemically similar to polyethylene that the wax moth caterpillars can biodegrade it.A far easier and less hazardous solution to the plastic problem could be found in bacteria, however. After all, it seems you can find bacteria that will eat almost anything. Some happily devour toxic chemicals, such as perchlorate (weed killer); others thrive amid radioactive waste. And indeed last year  identified a bacterium existing in the?wild that can feed on another common plastic, polyethylene terephthalate, which is used to make bottles for soft drinks and?water.It＊s possible that bacteria might, in fact, be responsible for the plastic-digesting ability of  larvae. Another wax-eater, the , was found in 2014 to house?bacteria in its digestive tract that?can break down polyethylene.  might prove to have such gut bacteria too.Those bacteria could provide the ideal solution. They could be brewed up in fermentation vats that would dissolve plastics without anyone having to contemplate breeding vast wax moth colonies. Alternatively, it might be possible to extract the particular enzymes the caterpillars use and put them to work on their own 每 a kind of concentrate of gastric juices.These are the real reasons why the new discovery is promising, and not because we＊ll soon be feeding plastic bags to caterpillars. As usual with science, you don＊t get the solution on a plate, but have to follow clues with patience and care. It doesn＊t make for great headlines. But honestly, the bees would thank you for it."																																																			
"One of the US state department＊s three science envoys resigned on Wednesday, the latest in a wave of defections over Donald Trump＊s response to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, .Daniel Kammen, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a letter  that Trump had failed to condemn white supremacists and neo-Nazis, part of ※a broader pattern of behavior that enables sexism and racism, and disregards the welfare of all Americans, the global community and the planet§. that ※both sides§ were to blame for the violence between white supremacists and counter protesters in Virginia on 12 August, and said there were ※very fine people§ among those who participated in the white nationalist rally. The science envoys serve as unpaid volunteers and engage with government and non-government science officials around the world. In his letter, Kammen also criticized Trump＊s decision to leave the Paris climate accord. The first letters of each paragraph spell out the word ※IMPEACH.§Kammen and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. State department spokeswoman Julia Mason said Kammen ※made a personal decision to resign§. ※We appreciate his dedicated service to US scientific diplomacy,§ Mason said. Science envoys typically serve for one year. According to his LinkedIn profile, Kammen had served as an envoy since August 2016. Margaret Leinen, director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, and Thomas Lovejoy, an ecologist at George Mason University in Virginia, still serve as state department science envoys, Mason said. They did not respond to requests for comment. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor in Texas, served as envoy in 2015 and 2016 and said he has been in contact with the state department about possibly returning. He would be willing to do so even after Trump＊s post-Charlottesville statements, he told Reuters on Wednesday.※Despite those comments I think it＊s important to be willing to serve the United States,§ Hotez said. Trump＊s comments sparked  from White House advisory councils, leading to their disbanding, and earned condemnations from Republicans and Democrats alike. Similar to Kammen, members of the President＊s committee on the arts and the humanities who resigned en masse last week used the first letter of each paragraph in their resignation letter to spell out ※RESIST,§ a rallying cry for Trump＊s opponents.

The public has been sickened by news of the hunting and blood-sports channel, and some Arsenal fans are .

But trophy hunting seems more clear-cut, doesn＊t it? The world  by an American hunter in Zimbabwe. So how, you may ask, is this depraved and hugely unpopular pastime allowed to continue legally?The answer is money. Wealthy westerners pay tens of thousands of pounds for the chance to kill a leopard, hippo or rhino. Often they take the head or another part of the poor animal＊s carcass and parade it on camera, or display it in their home.

More significant is the hapless Barr＊s promise that the channel will only show legal hunts. ※As long as it＊s legal it will be on there,§ he adds.

Taking his vacuous argument at face value, that would mean it is fine for MOTV to broadcast what lurks in all the most vile corners of the internet.What we see in these weasel words is a lack of morality and restraint in the trophy-hunting community. As for the channel＊s bankroller, Kroenke, as any Arsenal fan will tell you, popularity is of . The man whose nickname 每 Silent Stan 每 points to the contempt he has for both supporters and public relations, is unlikely to be ruffled by the public outcry over his channel.Therefore, decency must be imposed.

"Conservationists have called for action to protect the capercaillie, one of Scotland＊s rarest and most treasured birds, after data showed its population had fallen 50% in just over two decades.An extensive field survey of capercaillie breeding grounds in the Highlands estimated a population of only 1,114 birds between 2015 and last year, compared with an estimate of 2,200 between 1992 and 1994. The world＊s largest type of grouse, the capercaillie was placed on the UK＊s red list of the most endangered birds after a severe population decline from the 1970s onwards.The survey suggests the shy and elusive bird, which was reintroduced to  in the 1830s after a previous extinction, is now almost wholly restricted to forests in Strathspey in the Cairngorms, where more than 80% of the remaining birds live.It is believed to have wholly disappeared from the islands where it once lived on Loch Lomond, and its numbers are shrinking fast in Deeside and Perthshire, raising questions about the overall conservation effort to protect it. Ornithologists blame changing climate (affecting important plants for the capercaillie such as the blaeberry), collision with deer fences, predation and increasing pressure from housing developments and sports such as mountain biking for the decline. Its breeding has been hit hard by increasingly wet and erratic weather conditions in spring and early summer depleting food supplies when capercaillie hens are readying to breed, and during the first week of a chick＊s life.After previous surveys recorded a sudden slump in capercaillie numbers in the late 1990s, where the population fell to 1,073, conservationists removed or made more visible hundreds of miles of deer fences in long stretches of the Highlands, to prevent adult birds flying into them. Yet the latest figures show a continuing Scotland-wide decline in overall numbers.The field surveys, overseen by the government agency Scottish Natural Heritage and carried out over the winter every six years, show there were an estimated 1,980 capercaillie in 2003-2004, 1,285 in 2009-2010 and 1,114 in the latest survey.Conservationists warn that the pressures of climate change on the species is being exacerbated in the Cairngorms national park, now its last stronghold, by large scale house-building projects and recreational pressures being permitted or overseen by the park authority. The national park is being heavily marketed for outdoor sports, where mountain biking paths, hill walking and countryside sports can disturb the bird throughout the year and increase the fragmentation of its breeding and feeding areas. Gus Jones, an expert in capercaillie ecology with the Badenoch and Strathspey  Group, said: ※Inappropriate large-scale housing needs to be restricted because we have pretty limited woodland. Housing and recreational pressures in the wrong places are sterilising large areas which capercaillie need or are making them less suitable.§SNH confirmed that its efforts to protect the bird were now focusing on the Cairngorms. It said work was going on to help capercaillie outside the park area but did not identify new projects designed to do so. ※The latest national survey shows that the majority of capercaillie in Scotland are within the Cairngorms national park so it is appropriate to focus our limited resources there,§ a spokesman said. ※However, action will still continue outwith the park＊s boundaries.§Cairngorms national park said its capercaillie strategy was intended to heavily involve the local community and carefully manage recreational activities to protect its habitats. ※We hope to develop a programme of conservation action to support the long-term survival of the species and provide a model to save ＆at risk＊ species in national parks around the world,§ said Andy Ford, the park＊s nature manager."

"ews that  has been welcomed by fishermen, environmentalists and fish and chip lovers. After decades of overfishing, cod reached its nadir in 2006. By then, stocks were less than a fifth of levels seen in the early 1970s, and only a third of the size needed for long-term sustainability. This year stocks finally climbed back above the threshold for maximum sustainable yield, which means cod should be back on the menu for good.The comeback has been bought at the price of long-term restraint in catches, and an innovative partnership between fishermen and managers. Landings today are less than an eighth of their 1970s peak, while fishermen have introduced measures like temporary closures to protect places with high bycatch of under-sized fish. Those with long experience in the industry say they haven＊t seen as many cod, or such big fish, for 40 years. Their efforts have been rewarded with the ＊s blue tick for sustainability. So can we now eat cod with a clear conscience? Not quite.The problem with many fishing methods is that they cause significant collateral damage in their pursuit of the target fish. Bottom trawling, the method used to catch North Sea cod, has come in for particular criticism. Heavy trawl nets dragged across the seabed catch a wide variety of species as well as cod. They also damage and destroy sensitive seabed life, such as sponges, corals and hydroids. When oil companies discovered cold-water coral reefs in the North Sea in the 1980s, half of them had already been turned to rubble by the long-term impacts of trawling.Cod are well suited to intensive fishing. They are generalist predators that thrive even in places regularly hit by trawls, growing quickly and reproducing prolifically at a young age. But some of the species that live alongside them are not so fortunate. Two hundred years of intensive trawling have depleted many, like the common skate. This fish was a mainstay of early 19th-century trawl catches, and huge skate the size of dinner tables covered the floors of fish markets up and down the country. Today they have all but disappeared.In the middle of the North Sea there is a low hill, the Dogger Bank, long renowned for its enormous productivity. In 1840, a single sailing boat could catch a ton of halibut a day. Left to itself, this flatfish can reach sizes of more than two metres long and hundreds of kg in weight. Today, the entire fishing fleet catches just two tonnes of halibut per year from the Dogger, a decline equivalent to the loss of more than 99% of the fish.So while we celebrate cod＊s renaissance, let＊s not forget that we are still a long way from good management of UK waters. That will only be achieved with greater protection in addition to responsible fisheries. In the last seven years, the UK has established more than 80 marine protected areas. But they will only work if they are well-protected from fishing. Incredibly, nearly all the English marine protected areas still allow bottom trawling and dredging for scallops, both of which are incompatible with conservation. The Marine Stewardship Council is supposed to take environmental impacts into account in certifying good fisheries, but their environmental criteria are widely ignored in assessments. The blue tick should mean we can eat fish with a clear conscience, but it doesn＊t.The sea does so much more than feed us. Healthy ocean ecosystems are vital to keep waters clear and clean, protect coasts, and lock away carbon from greenhouse gas emissions. While fisheries dominate the agenda, these values are often ignored. But they shouldn＊t be taken for granted. In many parts of the world, like the Baltic Sea, China and Mediterranean, serious problems have emerged as a result of a cocktail of over-fishing, overuse and pollution. To achieve the right balance, we need to fish less using less destructive methods, waste less, pollute less and protect more. The cod comeback is a great start, but we＊re not there yet."																																																			
"If the US had a national house of horrors, it would probably be the federal government compound that lies on the fringes of Denver, Colorado, incongruously set within a wildlife reserve where bison languorously dawdle against a backdrop of the snow-crowned Rockies. The , operated by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), is a warehouse of the macabre. It＊s a Noah＊s ark of protected deceased biodiversity that smugglers attempted to get into the US before being caught by FWS staff at airports and ports.Shelves bow under the weight of elephant tusks, leopard cubs in shocked repose, crocodile skin boots and quack medicines made from mushed up parts of turtles and bears.Perched on top of the shelving units are taxidermy tigers. There＊s a bag filled with 40,000 sea horses. Towards the back of the warehouse there are two rhino heads in a crate. There are about 1.5m items at the repository, with approximately 200 specimens arriving each week for storage and education purposes.※This is just a thimbleful, just one speck of what comes into one port in one year, and it doesn＊t even include live animals imported to be pets,§ says Coleen Schaefer, the repository＊s supervisor. Schaefer spent three years as an inspection agent attempting to stem the tide at Los Angeles port, targeting traffickers who cram snakes into Pringles cans or strap 20 exotic birds to their torso, before deciding she couldn＊t face the daily heartbreak of euthanising animals any more.※This is more depressing though,§ Schaefer says, glancing at a lamp that＊s been made from a zebra＊s leg. New York City and Los Angeles are the main entry points for illegal wildlife products into the US. If they evade inspection, the potions end up in certain alternative medicine outlets, the stuffed animals in curio shops, and the severed heads of megafauna on the walls of people who want to add a touch of flamboyance to the ranch.The live animals invariably end up in the hands of collectors or those who wish to hold domestic safaris 每 the number of tigers in Texas, held for myriad purposes, now . ※The US is a big player in all this, you can＊t get around that,§ Schaefer says. ※We are a consumer nation. We aren＊t the source country of rhinos, or tigers or elephants, but they are here and they wouldn＊t be unless someone was importing them.§ Schaefer has just two members of staff to receive and catalogue the array of animal parts at the repository. Resources to catch smugglers are also stretched at American ports and airports. And the situation could deteriorate further 每 the Trump administration has  (pdf) that the FWS budget be cut next year, resulting in more than 300 staff losing their jobs.※There aren＊t many inspectors in the country and even when you do find something, it＊s hard to find an assistant district attorney who wants to take your case over some murderer for prosecution. It often ends with a slap on the wrist,§ Schaefer says.  ※Wildlife crime used to be just someone trying to make a fast buck but now it＊s very organised and it＊s hard to catch these people.§ As crime syndicates change, so does the type of smuggled products. Staff have recently noticed an influx of ivory hacked from juvenile elephants as poachers struggle to find enough full-grown adults to meet demand. ※They will take it off a baby as soon as they see it, it＊s so valuable just to make a trinket,§ says Schaefer. ※Biologists are going to find whole age classes of elephants are missing.§ ※It＊s frustrating. We could lose elephants in the wild in a decade. If we had more enforcement and also a different sentencing structure as a deterrent, that would really help.§ "																																																			
"n the 40 years that I have followed this steep, stony, path leading down to Tunstall reservoir, one moorland edge bank of fescues, betony and bell heather has always been a reliable spot for . Facing south-west, sheltered from wind by a larch plantation it＊s a perfect place to sit on a sunny afternoon and listen to their soundtrack of summer.You would need more finely tuned ears than mine to distinguish all 13 of our grasshopper species by their songs, but here I have only ever found two; the ,  and the , . The meadow grasshopper has a song that＊s memorably described in one field guide as a ※short, dry, chuckle§. But the male greens have a longer, more varied, repertoire; loud for attracting a mate＊s attention, more subdued courtship music for wooing her, and a staccato song during mating. This afternoon I could hear only isolated bursts of their chirruping, when the sun broke through clouds. There were few adults; most were nymphs in the penultimate stage of the four moults that lead to maturity. Only adults can produce the by dragging the little pegs on their hind femurs across the edges of their long membranous wings. Catching nymphs, for a closer look, was not difficult. They can only leap and then crash-land, so it is easy to trap them in cupped hands as they climb through the heather to a jump-off platform. Winged adults, with their leap-flutter-glide skills, are more of a challenge. After a hot chase I caught a female that had lost one hind leg, perhaps shed to escape a bird＊s beak. The damage might make for lop-sided leaps but should not put paid to courting; there are reported instances of such one-legged fiddlers successfully completing a call-and-response courtship duet.Back down in the valley bottom the air was filled with the scent of newly mown hay. A tractor with a cutter bar wended its way around a meadow in ever-decreasing orbits, leaving windrows of drying grass. In the gateway I found a full-grown meadow grasshopper clinging to a flowering culm of tufted hair grass, fortunate to have developed wings just in time to escape the mower.

"A fresh legal challenge could be brewing for Adani＊s planned . New advice has found the federal environment minister＊s approval of the mine may have been unlawful in light of new scientific evidence of its impacts on the endangered black-throated finch.As a result, the Australian  Foundation (ACF) has asked the federal minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, revoke the approval and ask Adani to resubmit its plans for consideration.The Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act  the minister must not act inconsistently with any official national recovery plan for an endangered species when approving a development. In addition, one of the  specifically stated that the company＊s management strategies must be consistent with the recovery plan for the black-throated finch.But according to legal advice given to the ACF by the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) , new scientific evidence shows the approval of the mine by the former environment minister Greg Hunt was inconsistent with the recovery plan.Fresh from , ACF spokeswoman Basha Stasak said the group is now weighing up its legal options 每 and wouldn＊t rule out the possibility of another court challenge.※What＊s being revealed here is the offset plan being put by Adani 每 according to the experts 每 is completely inadequate and we have serious concerns about that,§ she said.Adani＊s Carmichael mine  for the endangered black throated finch. As a result, Adani has been required to create ※offsets,§ which are supposed to provide alternative habitats for the birds.The legal issue arose after a team experts 每 the Black-Throated Finch Recovery Team 每 obtained Adani＊s plans for managing the birds, including plans for offsets, under freedom of information laws.The team＊s  of the plans were .They found the company＊s plans would result in a net loss of habitat for the birds, despite the government＊s official recovery plan stating that loss of habitat was the main threat facing the species.The plans also rely on new habitat being created, despite the experts saying such a feat has never been achieved.In addition, they say the mine will destroy the most important remaining habitat, which will not be able to be offset.Finally, they concluded that errors were made in the calculation of the offset habitats required, and they didn＊t take into account the reduced value of the offsets caused by their fragmentation.※These dodgy figures dramatically underestimate the impact of the mine on an endangered species and significantly reduced the amount of land Adani had to provide compensate for its impacts,§ Stasak said※What is clear is that this mine will clearly have an unacceptable impact on the black-throated finch. Everywhere you look Adani has cut corners in a desperate bit to get this mine up.§The letter to Frydenberg notes one of the reasons given for approval of the mine was that ※it would not have any unacceptable impacts on listed threatened species in view of all avoidance, mitigation and compensation (offset measures to be adopted)§.ACF says the evidence from the recovery team, after assessing the avoidance, mitigation and compensation plans, shows that there will be an unacceptable impact, meaning the minister should revoke his approval.Jo Bragg, a lawyer from the EDO Queensland said: ※The whole point of the act is to protect and assist the recovery of species like the black-throated finch.※Here we have a case where the offsets won＊t result in a net increase in habitat of the endangered species, therefore for this act to be working, the minister really does need to ＃ revoke the approval and deal with the new information about the lack of net increase in habitat of the endangered black throated finch.§Bragg said that when a minister＊s decision was found to be unlawful, there were avenues for legal challenges of that decision.The letter to Frydenberg from EDO Queensland says: ※ACF considers that the complete loss of the best habitat in Australia for the BTF as a result of the construction of the Carmichael project is an unacceptable impact. Had the information above and expert advice been available at the time of decision it would have led to a decision to not grant the approval.§A spokesman for Adani said it did not have a comment ※on someone having a legal opinion based on an assertion§.But the spokesperson did forward a response to the expert scientific opinion from last week, which said ※all of Adani＊s work is consistent with the team＊s own black-throated finch recovery plan, as required by the governments.§※Adani remains open to including and consulting with the team if the discussions are private, proactive and positive rather than held through media in a negative manner that is aimed more at blocking development of the Galilee,§ the response said.A spokesperson from Frydenberg＊s office said: ※The commonwealth environmental approval for the Carmichael coalmine went through an extremely rigorous process and includes conditions that will provide long-term benefits for the environment through the development of an offset package, including a biodiversity offset strategy.※The conditions placed on the project followed a comprehensive environmental impact assessment process under the EPBC Act and state legislation, including opportunities for public comments.§"																																																			
"Britain must prepare itself for invasions of growing numbers of foreign sea creatures attracted by our warming waters, a new report has warned. Some newcomers could have devastating effects, others could be beneficial, say the researchers.Examples provided by the team include slipper limpets that could destroy mussel and oyster beds. By contrast, new arrivals such as the American razor clam and Pacific oyster could become the bases of profitable industries for British fishermen.The team＊s research also stresses that Britons will have to change their  they eat as favourites will disappear from UK waters. Haddock and cod are being forced polewards as ocean temperatures rise, while flatfish like sole and plaice have nowhere suitable to go. At the same time, cuttlefish and sardines are being caught in rising numbers and are destined to become the fish of the future for Britain.The latest report, published in , provides a crystal ball that could highlight which parts of our coastlines will be most vulnerable to climate change triggered by rising atmospheric levels of greenhouse gas emissions produced by cars, factories and power plants. Sea temperatures around Britain have already risen by more than 1.5C in the past 30 years because of these changes, and scientists have warned this trend could continue for much of the rest of the century.※In a few decades the temperature of our seas is likely to be roughly the same as those found in the waters around Portugal at the turn of the last century 每 so we can expect to find the kind of marine life that existed there in British seas in the near future,§ said marine biologist Professor Stephen Simpson, of Exeter University. ※Apart from cuttlefish and sardines 每 which are already moving into our waters 每 we can expect fish like red mullet and john dory to be more common. By contrast the haddock is already disappearing from the southern North Sea, while plaice and sole are also becoming less and less prevalent. Fortunately, cod appears to be more resilient.§Marine biologists have warned in the past that profound changes will affect the seas surrounding the British Isles but it is still not known exactly when and where the changes will occur.The new study 每 by government marine scientists collaborating with Met Office and Exeter and East Anglia university researchers 每 was carried out to make more accurate predictions about what will happen in our seas as the planet heats up.※We need to be more precise about the changes that lie ahead,§ Simpson said. ※At present we are catching more and more fish that is traditional fare for the continent, and we are exporting them back to these countries. At the same time the cod, haddock and sole we used to catch in our own waters are now being caught in remoter fisheries, such as those round Iceland, and are being sold back to us. That is a serious imbalance which, as Brexit approaches, we have to get right.§The point was backed by the paper＊s lead author, Dr Bryony Townhill, of the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas): ※Knowing which species are likely to spread, and to where, means that we can focus efforts to understand their potential impact and explore opportunities to prepare or mitigate them.§The team used advanced oceanographic and climate modelling systems to forecast environmental conditions in the waters round the UK and found that many non-native species, which have already had significant impacts in other nations, could soon become established in the UK. Native species of mussels, fish or oysters could be displaced, while harbours and boats 每 and also cooling ducts for power stations 每 could be fouled or blocked, they concluded.One invader highlighted in the report is the club tunicate 每 a soft-bodied creature from Asia that Simpson described as looking like ※a floating plastic bag§. It has reached UK waters and is very likely to spread round our coast. Not only does it out-compete shellfish in particular for food 每 causing great harm to mussel beds, for example 每 but it releases toxins that can trigger respiratory attacks in humans. Other hazards that could take advantage of our warming waters are wireweed and the acorn barnacle. Both compete for food and space with local species and foul harbours and ships.By contrast, the report points out that shellfish such as the Manila clam and the American razor clam have considerable potential to form the basis of commercially valuable farms if they become established in our waters.※We have to be prepared for these sorts of creatures arriving and spreading in our waters,§ Simpson added. ※They have enormous potential for good 每 and to cause harm. In the past, many different species used to get washed into our waters but could not survive the cold of a UK winter. Those cold conditions have become a thing of the past, however. Life in our seas is changing.§"																																																			
"Four underground  coalmines operated by Glencore and Anglo American could be prosecuted or even shut down for failing to properly monitor dust levels.Anthony Lynham, the state＊s mines minister, has named and shamed the companies in parliament, warning that they risked severe penalties for failing to meet monitoring obligations designed to protect workers from dust-related diseases such as black lung.The mines inspectorate could demand full, independent safety audits or opt to prosecute, or even close, Glencore＊s Oaky North and Oaky No 1 mines and Anglo＊s Moranbah North and Grosvenor sites, he said.※Based on our knowledge of diseases caused by coal dust, it is my view that any failure to comply reflects a gross disregard of an operator＊s obligations to protect their workforce,§ Lynham told parliament on Thursday night. said it was ※very disappointed§ in itself, and its dust monitoring and reporting failures had been rectified and an investigation launched.The company briefed workers at its two mines on Friday morning, with further briefings expected after a meeting between the company and the inspectorate.※We will work with the Queensland mines inspectorate to ensure this won＊t happen again,§ the company said.Anglo has been asked for comment.But the Labor MP Jo-Ann Miller accused her own government of failing to act promptly on a report about coal workers＊ pneumoconiosis, or black lung.Miller, who chairs the coal workers pneumoconiosis select committee that produced the report, said there was no excuse for the government＊s dithering.※The committee tabled its  report on 29 May 2017, outlining 68 recommendations to address the systematic failures which have led to the re-identification of CWP in at least 23 workers in Queensland in recent times,§ she said .※This government has still not responded to the report ＃ we call on the government to act immediately and adopt the black lung report.§The Construction, Forestry,  and Energy Union says immediate action must be taken against the companies.※The rediscovery of black lung has sent shudders through the coal industry,§ a spokesman, Stephen Smyth, told the ABC. ※And here we have coal companies Glencore and Anglo at these mines who continue to obviously expose workers to high levels of dust. ※We need the inspectorate, the regulator, to come in and take some immediate action to ensure they are in compliance.§"																																																			
"am Brody is not a real estate agent, but when his friends want to move home they get in touch to ask for advice. He is a flood impact expert in  每 and he has plenty of work to keep him busy.The  metropolis has more casualties and property loss from floods than any other locality in the US, according to data stretching back to 1960 that Brody researched with colleagues. And, he said: ※Where the built environment is a main force exacerbating the impacts of urban flooding, Houston is number one and it＊s not even close.§Near the Gulf coast, Houston is also at annual risk from hurricanes: it is now into the start of the 2017 season, which runs from June to November. Ike, the last hurricane to hit the Houston region, caused $34bn in damage and killed 112 people across several states in September 2008.There is little hope the situation is going to get better any time soon. Earlier this month, days after Donald Trump announced the US will withdraw from the Paris accord on climate change, a new report warned that .Brody, a professor in the department of marine sciences at Texas A&M University＊s Galveston campus, said the requests for help in Houston from people moving homes inspired him to create a forthcoming web tool so that people can type in an address and get a risk score.※If you can see your crime statistics, shouldn＊t you be able to see your flood risk also? And other risks as well, human-induced risks?§ he said. The site will be named Buyers Be-Where.In May 2015, eight people, many of them motorists, died in Harris County when .Last year, another six lost their lives in an April . An inch of rain fell over the county in only five minutes, with a peak of 16.7in in 12 hours.The events damaged thousands of homes, turning major freeways into canals and piling up vehicles as if they were in a junkyard.  and prompted more than 1,800 high water rescues.Significant rains have always been a feature of life in south-east Texas. What bothers Brody and local environmentalists is the extent to which human activity is making things worse.※Houston is situated in a low-lying coastal area with poorly draining soils and is subject to heavy rainfall events and storm surge events, which makes it very prone to flooding. And the climate is changing. In Galveston Bay the sea level is rising. We know the area is experiencing more heavy downpours,§ Brody said.※It pales in comparison with the other driving force, which is the built environment. If you＊re going to put 4 million people in this flood-vulnerable area in a way which involves ubiquitous application of impervious surfaces, you＊re going to get flooding.§In other words: there is a lot of concrete in Houston. In 2000, 4.7 million people lived in the Houston metropolitan area. Now the population is about 6.5 million. While efforts are under way to densify and improve public transport in the urban core, much of the growth has been suburban, where houses are big and cheap and commuters drive long distances on some of the world＊s widest freeways. The city keeps loosening its belt: a third ring-road cuts through exurbs some 30 miles from downtown, .To the west, idyllically named middle-class subdivisions sprout on former farmland, served by new retail complexes and multi-lane roads. Here, 3,500 sq ft homes can be bought for less than $400,000, helping to explain the region＊s population explosion. But it may be coming at a price 每 one paid downstream.The Bayou City＊s vein-like network of creeks and rivers are one of its defining features, but heavy rains turn them from subdued to seething. The Buffalo Bayou＊s light brown waters meander 50 miles from west of the city through downtown to large bays in the east. The threat of catastrophic overflowing is mitigated by two dams built in the 1940s that the army corps of engineers has  and is now repairing. The danger is lessened, too, by the natural defence of the western plains 每 but here, water-retaining grasses are being replaced by non-absorbent surfaces, which encourage water to travel downstream. Brody calculates that each new square metre of pavement in Houston on average adds $4,000 worth of flood damage.Founded in 1992, the Katy Prairie Conservancy, a not-for-profit land trust, has a field office in bucolic land an hour＊s drive from the skyscraping oil industry headquarters dotting central Houston. The Katy Prairie was once estimated at 500,000 to 750,000 acres, before Houston boomed. The Conservancy owns about 14,000 acres 每 an area roughly the size of Manhattan. It helps protect another 6,000, quietly working to shield fields from sprawl in a city and state better known for damaging the environment through oil and gas production than for preserving its natural resources.※We may not be able to stop flooding but we ought to be able to better manage it,§ said Mary Anne Piacentini, the executive director. ※Our grasses are great water-holding reservoirs. Initial studies that we were doing with the Harris County Flood Control District show that our prairie grasses can hold up to about 8in of water.§Her colleague, Wesley Newman, likens tall grass prairies to an upside-down rainforest: the grass can grow to 6ft to 8ft above ground and two or three times as much below. ※We＊ve come to realise that the grassland, the tall grass prairie, is maybe even more important than the wetlands,§ Piacentini said. ※The more that we can restore, the more likely it is that we will be able to increase the water-holding capacity of what we do, and that affects directly downstream Houston.§Inside Houston＊s second ring road, 30 miles east, a photo album sat on a table in Dean Bixler＊s living room. It was not filled with happy family portraits, but murky images of the flood-ravaged rooms of his house, with sofas elevated on chairs above coffee-coloured water.The 60-year-old bought it in 1996, not imagining that his renovation budget would ever need to take the cost of pumps into account. Bixler said his house, built in 1960, has flooded three times since 2009, submerging his long front lawn and invading his home. ※You could not see any grass. That＊s a lot of frickin＊ water,§ Bixler said. In 2015, the repairs took about five months. In 2016, his flood-proofing measures kept water infiltration to an inch and a half.Bixler is a member of , a group that last year filed a lawsuit against the city and a local infrastructure authority alleging that poorly mitigated developments are causing hundreds of homes to flood.※The truth is that most of the flooding in Houston is manmade,§ said Ed Browne, another member, pointing out that many people who get flooded, Bixler included, are not in the 100-year floodplain 每 an area calculated to have a 1% annual chance of flooding.But Bixler＊s part of town has in the past decade been extensively redeveloped, with new shopping malls, office blocks, homes and apartment complexes, many designed, critics say, with flood-control strategies such as elevation that appear to prioritise self-protection with little overall plan as to what happens to the diverted water.It is a worrying vision of the future: stronger and more frequent storms with fewer natural barriers, while rapid and haphazard urban development with limited oversight creates new at-risk zones or worsens drainage in known problem areas. The Harris County flood control district did not respond to requests for comment; its executive director, Russ Poppe, told the Houston Press last year that there are regulations to stop builders from increasing flood risks and that .While residents battle for local improvements, there are predictions worthy of a disaster movie for what could happen if a powerful hurricane barrels directly into Houston＊s industrial east. ※If we get 20ft plus of water up the Houston Ship Channel it will be apocalyptic. I think all of us that have studied hurricanes are absolutely petrified about a big storm flooding the Houston Ship Channel and basically causing a number of those storage tanks to become unmoored and releasing their contents,§ said Jim Blackburn, an environmental attorney and co-director of the Severe Storm Prediction, Education, and Evacuation from Disasters (SSPEED) Center at Rice University.※There＊s a lot of very dangerous materials that are generally handled, all things considered, fairly well, but they＊re not designed against 20ft floods and if we have that it＊s just going to be an incredibly bleak situation,§ he said.The coastal area from Galveston to Houston is home to several hundred thousand people, Nasa＊s Johnson Space Center, the US＊s second-biggest seaport in terms of total tonnage, some of the nation＊s largest refineries and its biggest petrochemical complex.It is not lost on environmental activists that those refineries, as part of the fossil fuels industry, may be imperiled by extreme weather linked to climate change. As a  pointed out last year, had Ike been a little stronger and not changed course at the last minute in 2008, Blackburn＊s nightmare scenario might have become reality. According to the SSPEED Center, a 24ft storm surge along the Ship Channel would cause about 90m gallons of crude oil and chemical substances to rush into neighbourhoods and Galveston Bay 每 an event that a 2015 report claims .To say nothing of the economic impact on the region and the nation 每 a lengthy shutdown of south-east Texas＊s facilities would be felt all over the country as products such as gasoline and jet fuel would become scarcer and more expensive.A multibillion-dollar coastal barrier has long been on the wish list 每 but is far from being realised, since there is as of yet no consensus over the design, implementation and funding. ※If you look historically at major hurricane enters Galveston Bay every 15-20 years, so it＊s going to happen,§ said Brody, the professor. ※It is something that keeps me awake at night every June that rolls around, hurricane season, because it＊s not if, it＊s just when 每 and every year we put more people and critical assets in harm＊s way. We keep rolling the dice and the stakes become higher.§"																																																			
"It was good to see that unresolved 2015 debate between Mark Cocker and Robert Macfarlane on the ※new nature writing§ given another airing in Alex Preston＊s review of The Way of the Hare by Marianne Taylor (, 24 June). It needs sorting out more than ever, but to put it in terms of a ※reanimation of CP Snow and FR Leavis＊s old ＆Two Cultures＊ argument§ only skirts an issue which really has much more to do with language and purpose than obsolescent arguments about poetry versus science.Good nature writing, almost by definition, needs both, and is informed by both. New nature writing＊s current problems lie largely in the lack of recognition, or acknowledgment, of that old truth, that you write to find out what you think, often relying instead on too much poetry on the one hand or too much science on the other.

"By Anthony Tucker, our Science Correspondent28 March 1967Scientists and technologists at the oil disaster operations centre at Plymouth are desperately sifting ideas which might avert a major coastal catastrophe. But there is no hope of any sudden change in the pattern of the defensive procedure.The 1,200-yard long boom of large polyurathene blocks, which might be used round the wreck, is being assembled at Devonport, where it will be fitted with an underwater skirt and a containing net. Six 250-foot lengths of shallow, anti-submarine boom, light enough to be towed by small boats, have been fitted with hessian panels and are deployed as sweepers in the rivers Fal and Helford to protect oyster beds.There are 300,000 gallons of oil dispersant in stock, mainly held in readiness by the Navy, and another 77,000 gallons have been distributed to local authorities. Working under emergency conditions, the Services are adapting equipment 每 from pumps to scoops 每 which might be brought into use. Among the 150 or so ideas that have come forward from the public, the majority of them concerned with lifting the wreck, or providing sweeps and booms, the idea for a shallow polythene device  is among a handful which will be tested. There is little doubt that once the oil has escaped from the region of the wreck the only way to prevent coastal damage is to sweep the sea. Although oil on the high seas has been a potential hazard for more than half a century, no one has seriously considered the practical problems involved in a major spillage, nor taken steps to design and test devices.Theoretically, a shallow curtain wall forming a circle one and a half kilometres in diameter could contain the entire cargo of a ship the size of the Torrey Canyon at an oil depth of about 10 centimetres. Such a curtain, slowly, winched in, would be capable of both retaining the oil and maintaining an adequate oil level during a pumping-off operation.But, marine operations are never as easy as they sound. Any work carried out in the vicinity of a massive oil pool is hazardous, and the effects of wind, current, waves, and ship movement multiply the difficulties of every step of the operation."																																																			
"s we dissect the Finkel review＊s failure to give serious credence to Australia＊s commitment to the Paris agreement, what is yet again missing from the debate is a discussion of the economic and technological transition that is rapidly unfolding.President Donald Trump attempts to revive failed rust belt industries in the states with hollow and economically ludicrous promises 每 promises which helped put him into the White House. New industries are growing that have already created many millions of jobs around the world and which will provide clean energy to power the 21st century.This is not an ※alternative fact§; it is the only game in town.For the second straight year in a row the . Renewable energy technologies are increasingly competitive with thermal electricity generation 每 without subsidies and without factoring in all the hidden costs of thermal power plants and their associated extractive industry requirements (think water pollution, emissions, coal ash, mercury).  Ahead of the opening of COP22 in Morocco late last year, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) published a  documenting key trends and milestones in the rapid transformation of the global energy economy. examines the broad emerging patterns and highlights country-specific trends and key data on national and international investment toward renewables and clean energy technologies.  Throughout 2016, as with 2015, the indicators of great change in energy markets could be seen everywhere. But when examined holistically at a global level, the scale and pace of change is simply staggering 每 not entirely unexpected, but staggering nonetheless.The breakthroughs have been dramatic. Our research found solar farms contracting to supply power at record low tariffs across countries as diverse as India, the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Argentina, Mexico and South Africa in 2016. Offshore wind farms are being tendered for off Germany that will supply , a decade ahead of the most bullish expectations even just last year. Rapidly falling costs of battery storage will allow time shift solar to power homes without interruption. Australia＊s policymakers and pundits need only to look at their neighbours in China and India to understand the breadth and scope of this transformation. The fact that we still have politicians holding up lumps of coal in our national parliament as some sort of testament to the fossil＊s future is breathtaking in its stupidity, and indeed its complete failure to recognise some very simple basic economics.This suggests stupidity on the part of our elected officials, simple economic illiteracy, or just sponsored obfuscation.Away from the petty political sideshow of the Australian energy debate, on show for all to see at full steam the last few days, China and India are embracing clean energy as they seek to address local pollution, reduce energy imports, reduce fossil fuel imports 每 and protect the global climate. They boast  more than twice that of the US 每 and they are embarking on transformative investments in their power sectors. There is more economic advantage for Australia to be found exporting clean energy equipment, finance, engineering, information and communication technology (ICT), and research and development knowhow than in seeking to supply thermal coal into India and China＊s oversupplied markets. But the lessons from around the world are clear: successful clean energy industries need domestic policy support and regulatory encouragement. Too often, as in Australia, incumbent mostly foreign owned fossil interests have proved adept at using well-paid lobbyists and generous campaign contributions to shift the playing field away from its clean energy competitors. Looking at the donation patterns of these foreign owned fossil fuel companies, it would be hard to mount an argument that there was not a direct correlation between what they give and the spoils they get.The Paris agreement does much to address this imbalance. It provides a roadmap that leads away from the fossil-fuelled economy of the past towards a global economy that is compatible with a sustainable climate. It gives encouragement to investors and entrepreneurs that they will find ready markets for low-carbon technologies.Regardless of Trump＊s decision or Australia＊s weak commitment to the Paris agreement, the urgency of the climate change challenge means that those markets will still be created. Costs will continue to fall to a degree that fossil industries will be outcompeted. Investments in high-carbon infrastructure will likely become stranded, costing their owners dearly. Repudiating or shunning the Paris agreement may slow this process, but it won＊t reverse it. Tragically it will be the stranded economies, the stranded communities and the stranded workers and their families who will face the brutal fallout from the failure of political leaders to grasp, or even acknowledge, the greatest economic, financial and technological changes we have seen in nearly 150 years."																																																			
																																																			
"World leaders＊ response to Donald Trump＊s announcement that he would withdraw the US from the Paris agreement . But did it sting the president and his administration? To deter other potential backsliders and maintain the integrity of the Paris agreement, the perpetrator of a defection of this magnitude should be made to feel the pain. But how?Trump 每 and other leaders that may later try to wiggle out of their commitments 每 must be shown that there will be real consequences to their credibility and influence and relations with other countries.Ensuring the vitality of the agreement requires countries to show Trump that his ability to achieve other core diplomatic objectives will depend on honouring US commitments, and that he must consider more than the  in determining how he will contribute to the global effort. If countries fail to offer a strong response, it risks setting the disastrous precedent that commitments can be treated as provisional, progression is not expected, and free-riding will not entail significant costs. This will only invite further defection.In an important 2007 essay, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance Michael Liebreich proposed a strategy for countries to deter defection and achieve strong international climate outcomes. Liebreich argued that the best approach is for countries to be ※nice, retaliatory, forgiving and clear§. That is, they should unilaterally offer to do as much as possible, retaliate against those who do not reciprocate, reward recalcitrant countries when they do step up, and let other countries know in advance that this is their strategy.Since the US election, most countries have bent over backwards to be nice to Trump. Even as Trump wavered, more than 40 countries have joined the agreement and numerous others have . Few countries have called him out for his aggressive efforts to reverse Obama-era climate policies. Now that he has said he will withdraw, leaders have clearly expressed their dismay at this decision. But these words surely will not be enough to persuade him to change course, or to deter others from weakening their commitments. Where is the retaliation?Many have suggested that border carbon adjustments on American goods might be an appropriate response. And for good reason: no country wants to expose its manufacturers to competition from countries that are free riding on its efforts. But since trade sanctions can be a blunt and self-defeating tool, countries should also seek leverage points in other areas of concern to the administration.One obvious and immediate step would be to curtly , followed by an effort to isolate the US within the ongoing Paris negotiations. Because the Trump administration cannot leave the agreement until November, 2020, the administration could muck up the development of the ※rulebook§ that will guide its implementation. Arguably, with one foot out the door, the US may not retain much influence in these discussions. But the US also negotiates in concert with the Umbrella Group, an informal bloc of countries that includes Japan, Canada, Russia, Australia, and New Zealand. By suspending collaboration with the US and declining to coordinate common positions, these countries could signal both their ongoing commitment to the agreement and their displeasure with Trump＊s decision, while limiting the administration＊s ability to make mischief in the rulebook negotiations.Countries could also seek leverage outside of the climate policy space, focusing on issues of particular concern to the Trump administration. Consider Nato financing. As with the Paris agreement, Trump feels aggrieved that Nato is profoundly unfair because he believes that the US pays a disproportionate share of the costs. At the same time that he has refused to contribute the ※billions and billions and billions§ that he bizarrely claims the Paris agreement obliges the US to pay in climate assistance, he has demanded that the other Nato members shoulder more of the costs of the alliance.Linking these two issues provides an opportunity to gain leverage. Nato members could reiterate their willingness to contribute more to collective security, but make clear that they view climate stability as critical to that security. They could then say that if the US will not address the climate dimensions of their common security challenges, they will need to pick up the slack, and that that may not leave much room for increased military expenditures. In fact, Angela Merkel has already made a similar argument with regard to Germany＊s willingness to absorb a disproportionate share of the costs of ameliorating the ongoing refugee crisis.Such cross-issue linkages are common in other areas of international relations, but have not been widely used to advance climate action. No doubt, it will not be easy for countries, even in coalition, to implement such an assertive climate diplomacy against the Trump administration. Confronting a bully never is. But because the precedent they will set in responding to Trump＊s attack on the agreement may well determine whether the ambition mechanism can work as planned, nothing less than the integrity of the Paris agreement depends on it."

He might also have been thinking of the legend that unbaptised children were turned into nightjars when they died. The song is that wraithlike, that hackle-raising. Our nightjar began to sing deep within the conifer thicket. We moved closer, stepping into the embrace of medicine-scented branches. As if wanting us to appreciate more fully the weird loveliness of its song, the nightjar flew towards us and settled on a branch above, letting forth a volley of ghostly churrs. For five or six minutes we lived nowhere but inside that eerie stream of sound. Back in my car I put on Joanna Newsom＊s , in which the nightjar is a kind of fluttering familiar. I rolled down the windows. Rain came, and thunder, and even over it and the music, I could still hear the nightjar calling, somewhere in the dense and ancient forest."																																																			
" has hit back against Theresa May＊s attempt to portray him as unpatriotic and soft on terrorism, condemning as ※utterly ridiculous§ and ※offensive§ her claim that he ※doesn＊t believe in Britain§.As the campaign enters its final furlong, the  leader said he would not indulge in personal insults, despite the relentless mud-slinging from senior Tories 每 but accused the prime minister of exploiting her position to politicise the London Bridge terrorism attacks.May sought to shore up Tory support with a series of attacks on the Labour leader last week, claiming in a speech on Brexit that he ※doesn＊t believe in Britain§ days after saying he would be ※alone and naked in the negotiating chamber§ when  talks begin on 19 June.But Corbyn dismissed her remarks as ※complete nonsense§ in an interview with the Guardian. ※I want us to play a constructive role in the world. I want us to have a decent and harmonious community in Britain. Does that make me anti-British in some way? It＊s a ridiculous argument. It＊s utterly ridiculous. Actually it＊s offensive,§ he said.As he travelled across north-east England in Labour＊s battlebus at the close of a month-long campaign that has seen May＊s poll lead narrow sharply, Corbyn said that if he won on Thursday he would: Contact  and urge him to retract his ※unacceptable§ remarks about London＊s mayor, Sadiq Khan. Call Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron on Friday to kick off Brexit talks, saying his win would give him a mandate to negotiate tariff-free trade. Set a date for a quick budget to implement key policies, including lifting the public sector pay cap.  Confront Saudi Arabia over its funding for terrorist groups.May and her team have sought to refine their campaign message to the simple claim that she would make a better job of defending Britain＊s interests in Brexit talks.But Corbyn said he would strike a constructive tone with the German chancellor and French president on Friday morning, in contrast to a combative speech by May last month when she accused Brussels of meddling in Britain＊s election.※We will immediately guarantee rights of EU nationals living in Britain unilaterally,§ Corbyn said. Of Merkel, he said: ※I would hope she would make sure the same would be done for British nationals in her country and Europe but this is not a negotiation; we would do it anyway.§He said he would invite the German chancellor to the Emirates stadium to watch his team Arsenal in an effort to develop a friendly relationship. ※With Angela Merkel, we can discuss football and Brexit. I want to say to her that I like the German fanbase model [of running football clubs]. Then I＊ll invite her to come and watch Arsenal.§Dismissing fresh claims by the  that he is against ※shoot-to-kill§, Corbyn said he supported the actions of armed police who shot dead the three London Bridge attackers on Saturday night. ※They were defending themselves and defending innocent people. It was a proportionate response,§ he said, describing their actions as ※defensive shooting§.He has remained sanguine in the face of the blows levelled against him throughout the election campaign, describing himself several times as ※monsieur Zen§. ※There is a lot of negative campaigning against me, but the best way of dealing with a negative campaign is to be positive,§ he said.He deplored May＊s decision to make what he called a ※political speech§ outside No 10 Downing Street on Sunday, setting out new policies on tackling terrorism just hours after the attack on London.Unlike in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing a fortnight earlier, Corbyn said the Conservatives had refused to engage with Labour about whether to suspend election campaigning as a mark of respect and for how long.※May chose to make a political speech in the middle of the day 每 which I thought was inappropriate. It should have waited until the evening as I did,§ he said.Corbyn caused a flurry of excitement on Monday after telling an ITV interviewer that he backed calls, including from David Cameron＊s former adviser Steve Hilton, for the prime minister to resign over her record as home secretary in light the latest terrorist attacks.But he played down his earlier remarks, blaming the furore on ※the kind of excitement that happens during an election campaign, between different buses in different parts of the country, held together by the umbilical thread of a mobile phone signal§.He said: ※What I want is for her to be held to account. There are many very responsible people, fire service, police, many others, who are very concerned about how she performed as home secretary 每 presiding over 20,000 cuts to the police and the underfunding of the prisons service. The problems of the prisons have got to be addressed as well. There are a lot of people who in normal circumstances if she was still home secretary would be calling for her resignation. I＊m just saying: hold her to account at the election on Thursday.§Asked if he was going to win on Thursday, Corbyn did not hesitate before responding: ※Yes.§ He said the campaign had ※changed completely§ from the start, when Labour trailed the Tories by more than 20 points in the polls. ※We are getting an enormous amount of cut through,§ he said. ※This is the Labour party at its best. The support is very, very strong.§Corbyn has previously been pressed on whether he would resign if Labour lost, as Ed Miliband did in 2015. He said his team would ※apologise for nothing§ because they had done everything they could to try to win the election. He claimed the election boiled down to the Conservatives cutting services and leaving ※lots of young people shortchanged and older people isolated and not cared for§.Corbyn said he was keen to confront the US president about global warming. ※One of my first conversations with Donald Trump will be about climate change,§ he said, claiming that US support for the Paris climate agreement, which the president is planning to withdraw, was crucial.※A lot of people worked very hard to get India and China on board. To have achieved that, it is very sad that the US president decides to remove them from it.§ However, Corbyn said there was time to persuade Trump to reconsider. ※It is going to take them a few years to withdraw anyway.§Corbyn said a phone call to the US president, which he would make quickly after taking office if he won the election, would include a reaction to Trump＊s misleading Twitter attack on Khan for telling people not to be alarmed by the presence of extra police on the streets after Saturday＊s terrorist attack.※I would ask him if he would kindly reconsider that,§ the Labour leader said. ※It is not acceptable to make those sort of remarks about someone who has been elected to be mayor of our biggest city.§Corbyn described his own style of leadership as featuring two key traits: never to indulge in personal attacks and to reach out beyond those who originally supported his first attempt to take over at the helm of the party.

"Older, more polluting cars will have to pay a ?10 charge to drive in central  from 23 October, the city＊s mayor has said.Confirming he would press ahead with the fee, known as the T-charge,  said: ※It＊s staggering that we live in a city where the air is so toxic that many of our children are growing up with lung problems. If we don＊t make drastic changes now we won＊t be protecting the health of our families in the future.※That is why today, on the 14th anniversary of the start of the congestion charge, I＊ve confirmed we are pressing ahead with the toughest emission standard of any major city, coming to our streets from 23 October.§The announcement came after fresh warnings this week about the poor quality of London＊s air.The mayor spoke as he launched an online vehicle checker on the  for London website so drivers can check whether their vehicle will be affected by the T-charge, whose introduction coincides with the start of the autumn half-term.The levy is expected to affect up to 10,000 of the oldest, most polluting vehicles every week day, as it will apply to motorists who own vehicles that do not meet Euro 4 standards 每 typically those diesel and petrol vehicles registered before 2006.It will operate on top of, and during the same times, as the congestion charge, meaning it will cost ?21.50 a day to drive a pre-Euro 4 vehicle in centre London between 7am and 6pm Monday to Friday.London joins a growing number of cities around the world taking action against rising . In Paris,  between 8am-8pm on weekdays.Khan launched a consultation on the T-charge proposals last July at Great Ormond Street hospital for children, whose chief executive, Dr Peter Steer, said at the time: ※The mayor＊s drive to clean up the capital＊s air is fantastic news for our patients and staff. Children living in highly polluted areas are four times more likely to have reduced lung function in adulthood, yet improving air quality has been shown to halt and reverse this effect.§Air pollution is believed to cause almost 40,000 premature deaths every year in the UK and was in April labelled a  by a cross-party committee of MPs.

" addressed Donald Trump＊s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, calling the president a ※fucking egomaniac§.On Sunday＊s episode of his HBO show Last Week Tonight, Oliver stated: ※Earth, the adopted home world of Bj?rk: the reason we have to talk about Earth is this,§ before showing news clips of Trump＊s speech at the White House Rose Garden last week in which he formally announced his intention to remove the US from the accord, agreed by 195 nations in a global effort to fight climate change.Trump＊s decision was ※hardly surprising§, said Oliver. ※As a title, [the Paris accords] is so off-brand for him it might as well have been called ＆the globalist cock surrender＊ or a light jog.※But pulling out of this is a huge deal,§ he continued, firing back at Trump＊s claim that the deal made the US a laughingstock to other countries. ※They were happy because they secured a landmark victory for the future of the planet, you fucking egomaniac. The whole world is not secretly conspiring against the United States.§Oliver then addressed the president＊s belief that the deal harmed American businesses, 25 of which, including Microsoft and Intel, bought an advertisement in the New York Times in a last-ditch attempt to persuade Trump to remain a part of the agreement.※Well, come on. He was clearly never going to be convinced by an ad in the New York Times,§ Oliver joked. ※How was he going to see it? If those companies really wanted to get his attention, they needed to talk KFC into putting out a full-bucket ad which he could read on the toilet while eating chicken, because that, at his core, is who our president is.§But Oliver remains optimistic about the fight against climate change, suggesting Trump＊s highly controversial decision has its benefits.※Trump may have inadvertently done us a tiny favor this week, because the problem with climate change is that it＊s always felt so abstract and impersonal and far off in the future,§ he explained. ※The usual symbols that we use don＊t do much to fix or help that. It＊s either a graph that＊s difficult to understand or a sad polar bear on a small piece of ice. And it＊s hard to get emotionally fired up over that.※But this week, the climate change movement may have gotten a symbol to rally around, because apparently it was never quite enough to motivate ourselves out of love for this large gassy orb,§ Oliver joked. ※But maybe, just maybe, we can now motivate ourselves to do something out of our loathing of this one,§ he concluded, pointing to an image of Trump."																																																			
"The high court has ruled that tens of thousands of Nigerians affected by oil pollution cannot proceed with a legal challenge in the UK against Shell and its Nigerian subsidiary.The ruling is a blow for campaigners who called the ruling an ※outrage§. They had hoped the case would set an important precedent on jurisdiction, paving the way for other cases to be brought against UK-based corporations for their actions abroad.The lawyers who brought the action on behalf of two communities hit by oil spills said they would appeal the ruling by Mr Justice Fraser on Thursday, who gave permission to appeal. Leigh Day, the law firm acting on behalf of the claimants, said it was surprised at the dismissal in such an early stage of their case, which rested on their claim that parent company  has responsibility for its Nigerian arm and so the case should be heard in the UK.But the judge in his ruling concluded: ※there is simply no connection whatsoever between this jurisdiction and the claims brought by the claimants, who are Nigerian citizens, for breaches of statutory duty and/or in common law for acts and omissions in Nigeria, by a  company.§Shell has denied liability and argued last November that the challenge involves  that should be heard in a Nigerian court. The company avoided a London high court case in 2015, also brought by Leigh Day, when it .The new case involves two claims, one brought by more than 2,000 fishermen and their families in the Bille kingdom, and another by about 40,000 people in the Ogale community in Ogoniland, in the oil-rich Niger delta.King Okpabi, leader of the Ogale community, said: ※Our community is disappointed but not discouraged by this judgment and we are confident that, as in the Netherlands, the court of appeal will see things differently. Royal Dutch Shell makes billions of dollars of profit each year from Nigerian oil, but our communities which host its infrastructure have been left environmentally devastated.§Joe Westby, campaigner on business and human rights at Amnesty International, said: ※This ruling could mean that the communities will never receive meaningful compensation, and that the oil spills will be not be properly cleaned up.§ Sarah Shoraka of campaign group Platform called the ruling ※a true outrage§.Chief Temebo, spokesman for the Bille Council of Chiefs, said he could not get justice in Nigeria. ※If the claim does not continue in the English courts, we have no hope that the environment will ever be cleaned up and the fish will ever return to our waters. Shell will do nothing unless they are ordered to by the English courts.§But Justice Fraser, in his ruling today, wrote: ※The evidence before the court is that access to justice in Nigeria would not be denied to the claimants if these proceedings were not to continue in London.§Shell welcomed the dismissal of the claims. Igo Weli, general manager for external relations at Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), said: ※The court rightly decided these claims should be dealt with by the Nigerian courts and confirmed longstanding principles of corporate law, which are critically important for multinational companies headquartered in the UK.§Shell has been producing oil in Nigeria for nearly 70 years. Its subsidiary there is SPDC, which runs a joint venture with the Nigerian government. The company says the Bille and Ogale communities＊ problems with oil spills are due to sabotage, theft from pipelines, and illegal refining."

Particle pollution on some main roads in London has  when lorries were upgraded ahead of the low emission zone. France has just launched a  for low emission zones, and following the  new zones look set for many UK cities.Low emission zones exclude older vehicles, assuming they emit more pollution than the newer ones. But, for many years, new diesels passed ever-tighter exhaust tests in the laboratory only to emit much more nitrogen oxides on roads. This goes beyond the . Other vehicle manufacturers might not have a legal case to answer but they certainly have a moral one.Promisingly, it looks like the newest buses and lorries produce just a when compared to pre-2014 vehicles and, astonishingly, less than that emitted from the average new diesel car. Fitting better exhaust controls to older buses works too; on one London street  when half the buses were upgraded. Petrol exhaust technologies have worked well for more than 10 years. Greater priority also needs to be given to to reduce lorry and van movements.Each year＊s delay means more health harm. One answer would be a switch to only the very newest buses and lorries, and petrol cars instead of diesel, while alternative fuelled vehicles and their fuel infrastructure are developed longer-term. This requires scrappage and investment schemes. A large cost but the cost of not doing it is massive. However, simply cleaning exhausts would be a missed opportunity to build better cities. Reducing traffic would reduce air pollution, reduce climate change emissions, tackle the increasing particle pollution from brakes, tyre and road wear and, with more active travel, it would have huge health benefits. An annual benefit of could come from each person who swaps a five km daily car commute to a cycle journey.

"The ongoing cold, still weather is expected to send pollution levels soaring in  as freezing fog brings more disruption at airports and on the roads across the south of England.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan,  on Monday and experts said air quality was expected to remain unacceptably low on Tuesday.Widespread freezing fog also brought disruption for travellers and commuters. Heathrow announced it was to cancel 100 flights and there were also problems reported at Gatwick, London City, Stansted and Southampton airports.A Heathrow spokesman said: ※Persistent freezing fog across the south-east has reduced visibility at Heathrow again today. ※With [the airport] operating at more than 99% capacity, there are no gaps in the schedule that can be used for delayed flights and as a result, some passengers may experience disruption to their journeys today.§ He added that passengers should check their flight status with their airline before travelling to the airport. ※As always, Heathrow＊s top priority is the safety of passengers and we apologise to those whose travel has been affected by today＊s weather.§ Road users in the south were also being warned of difficult driving conditions. Dorset police reported 31 collisions on Monday 每 six times more than usual over that time on an average weekday. The force is urging motorists to take extra care on Tuesday, while the Met Office warned that journeys were likely to take longer than usual because of the ※adverse conditions§.Alex Burkill, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said although the cold weather would continue for the next few days it should become clearer, with improved air quality from Wednesday.※There is high pressure to the south-east of the UK and that is causing still, cold, damp weather causing frost and freezing fog. ※However, the [air] flow will increase from Wednesday and although it will still be cold that will bring clearer weather ＃ and better air quality.§According to the latest data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, by Monday evening eight regions of the UK  as having high or very high levels of air pollution, including the south-east, south-west, the east Midlands and Northern Ireland.In particular, parts of Bristol, Belfast and Nottingham were among those flagged as having high 24-hour mean levels of .Experts said that was caused by the still conditions, car fumes and a peak in the use of wood-burning stoves. As a result of the ※very high§ pollution alert, Khan has announced ?250,000 in funding for 50 schools in London boroughs where levels of the pollutant  exceed legal limits.The audits, to be carried out by a transport and environment consultancy, will highlight interventions that schools could put in place to lower emissions and reduce exposure to pollutants around school premises, Khan said.Recommended measures might include moving school entrances and play areas to reduce exposure to busy roads, and introducing ※no § zones and green infrastructure such as hedges and bushes to provide barriers to block out fumes.The mayor said: ※Every child deserves the right to breathe clean air in London and it is a shameful fact that more than 360 of our primary schools are in areas breaching legal pollution limits.§"																																																			
"London has been put on ※very high§ alert as cold and still weather, traffic, and a peak in the use of wood-burning stoves combined to send air pollution soaring in the capital and across swaths of the UK.According to  from King＊s College London, areas of London including Camden, the City of London and Westminster all reached 10 out of 10 on the air pollution index, with many other areas rated seven or higher. The forecast for Tuesday is that air pollution levels will remain unacceptably high in the capital with pollution levels expected to similarly persist in other areas across the country.※Today the shameful state of London＊s toxic air has meant that I am forced to trigger the first ＆very high＊ air pollution alert under my new comprehensive alert system,§ said the Mayor of London, .※This is the highest level of alert and everyone 每 from the most vulnerable to the physically fit 每 may need to take precautions to protect themselves from the filthy air.§Researchers said the pollution is primarily down to particulates, although nitrogen dioxide is expected to reach moderate levels at roadsides in rush hour.※This is a particularly bad pollution episode,§ said Timothy Baker of the environmental research group at King＊s College London. ※The peak we saw [on Sunday] night was the highest level [of PM2.5 particulates] since April 2011 as an average across London.§According to the latest data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, by Monday evening eight regions of the UK  as having high or very high levels of air pollution, including the south-east, south-west, the east Midlands and Northern Ireland. In particular, parts of Bristol, Belfast and Nottingham were among those flagged as having high 24-hour mean levels of PM2.5 particulates.Baker and colleagues said that  was down to the onset of chilly weather and a lack of wind that had enabled the accumulation of local pollutants, with high levels of particulates from traffic and wood burning adding to the problem. ※This episode is actually a perfect illustration of all the things that control air pollution,§ said Baker. ※The weather conditions happened to coincide with the two peaks 每 one from the traffic, one from the wood burning 每 and then that was on top of what we had already built up locally over a number of days and a bit coming in from the continent.§ A similar set of ingredients, he added, was likely to be behind the increase in air pollution in other regions of the UK and Europe.The continued cold snap, added Baker, meant that the city＊s problem was unlikely to clear until later in the week, with particulate levels for Tuesday predicted to remain high to very high. ※The wood-burning contribution we＊ll expect to fall a little, but the traffic contribution we are expecting to increase,§ he said. And while the wind was expected to pick up later in the week, dispersing local emissions, there was a chance that imports of air pollution from the continent could increase.In response to the high levels of air pollution, people were being advised to reduce physical exertion, with  in Aldgate, London, reducing outdoor activity for under fives. Pedestrians, said Baker, could also reduce their risks by using side roads to reach their destinations. ※Even though pollution is elevated everywhere across London at the moment, you can still limit your exposure somewhat by just not walking along main roads,§ he said. Earlier this month it was revealed that parts of London had surpassed their entire annual air pollution limit in the . The public health impacts of air pollution, meanwhile, continue to unfold, with , heart attacks and strokes all linked to poor air quality. Simon Birkett, the founder and director of the campaign group Clean Air in London, raised concerns that messages around the dangers of air pollution were failing to be delivered to those outside the capital. ※Three hundred people died early during one winter air-pollution episode in 2014. For goodness sake, therefore, why has this government stopped distributing press releases to warn people about the highest levels of air pollution? At least Londoners have Sadiq Khan warning them,§ he said.Baker agreed that the time for action was now. ※[This] is yet another piece of news which highlights the importance of trying to do something about air pollution across the board,§ he said. ※This is the sort of thing that leads to the sort of figures that are given as to the number of early deaths that occur because of air pollution 每 because it is something that impacts on the whole population.§"																																																			
"A proposal to impose Britain＊s first pollution-linked speed limits in order to help ease smog over  is being considered by Highways England.A 60mph speed limit at rush-hour when vehicle numbers are highest where the M1 runs close to schools and homes in the city could help address air quality concerns, a report commissioned by the agency found. The mandatory speed limit, if approved, would be in place between 7am and 7pm seven days a week between junctions 32 and 35a. The suggested initiative follows , published in December, which found that ※driving smoothly§ could ease air pollution. Accelerating or decelerating too rapidly leads to greater fuel consumption and means harmful emissions are being released into the environment unnecessarily, the study found.A 60mph speed limit could also help create a smoother journey as drivers would not be be accelerating and then decelerating at pinch points so often, a spokesperson for the AA said. The plan coincides with Department for Transport (DfT) plans for a ?106m ※smart motorway§, which is due to launch in March.The scheme is likely to add thousands of cars, vans and other vehicles to the roads, causing an increase in air pollution. Sheffield already misses EU air quality targets and was highlighted by the World Health Organisation for having .

Currently, an average of approximately 120,000 vehicles per weekday use the motorway in Sheffield, according to Mouchel, an engineering consultancy that put together the report.It estimates that the smart motorway scheme will add a further 5,000-10,000 vehicles a day by opening the hard shoulder to traffic. It stated: ※Air quality assessment predicted that operating a [smart motorway] at 70mph, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, would result in significant adverse impacts on air quality.§The consultancy firm found that the best way to prevent an increase in illegal pollution would be to implement a speed limit.The AA spokesman said the proposal, if implemented, could provoke anger among road users, who will face fines if they exceed 60mph.He said: ※Car users are always the easy hit when it comes to pollution when actually they are not one of the main contributors. There will be people raising their eyebrows about whether this is just an example of the authorities trying to look like they are doing something.※There will be a section of car users, who will see that this is not safety-related, and that they are being penalised for emissions that are likely to have come from other sources as well. That same section will say they pay billions of pounds in taxes ＃ and if we＊re contributing that amount of money why isn＊t it being spent on the road network to deal with the issues?§He added: ※There is a very good chance that the traffic is already moving at that speed during rush-hour.§Highways England stressed that the speed limit is just one of ※a range of other mitigation options§ being trialled, and that despite the scheme being due to launch at the end of March, ※there is no suggestion of a delay to the scheme on the M1 and there will be mitigation in place for when the scheme opens§.Other options include painting barriers with ※catalytic paints§ designed to remove pollutants from the air and putting piles of ※mineral polymer§ 每 made from a secret compound that absorbs nitrogen dioxide 每 alongside the road. Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield South East, told the Sunday Times: ※Sheffield has already had to close two schools by the M1 because the pollution was so bad, but there are still many residents breathing filthy air 〞 and there will be far more if the motorway gets busier.※The government has known about this problem but has still expanded the motorway. Now it is trialling these Mickey Mouse schemes which are bound to fail.§A Highways England spokesperson said: ※Smart motorways are central to the modernisation of England＊s motorways, reducing congestion and improving journey time reliability by smoothing traffic flows. One of our key challenges in delivering the ?15bn government investment in infrastructure is tackling the issue presented by air quality and in order to meet environmental targets we are investing in wider programme of air quality research to help address this.§A DfT spokesperson said: ※We are firmly committed to improving the UK＊s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. That is why we have invested more than ?2bn since 2011 to promote greener vehicles and support green transport schemes and have set out how we will improve air quality through a new programme of clean air zones.§The proposal comes as Sheffield＊s Green party launch a campaign to tackle the city＊s poor air quality. A statement said: ※Air pollution continues to exceed legal limits in many areas, contributing to an estimated 500 premature deaths in Sheffield every year.※We call on Sheffield city council to take action to tackle this public health crisis by urgently agreeing and implementing a new action plan to clean up the city＊s air and protect our health.§"

Amid a growing crisis in cities around the world, air pollution in parts of London smashed . And with poor air quality linked to dementia, heart attacks and strokes, it is taking its toll on?public health.※What people really struggle with is the dislocation in time,§ says Ian Mudway, lecturer in respiratory toxicology from the environmental research group at King＊s College London. ※The exposures you have now could produce effects in 20, 30, 40 years＊ time,§ he adds, pointing out that air pollution is  in the UK alone.A collaboration between curators Shrinking Space, scientists from the environmental research group at King＊s College London and  an organisation that pioneers the use of art to promote cultural changes to tackle climate change,  is an energetic mix of art, science and entertainment.Among the weekend＊s highlights, which includes a DJ set by former Pulp frontman, Jarvis Cocker, visitors will be able to don virtual reality headsets to take a tour around the Strand with the project . A 360∼ video, the experience explores how the area could be transformed through interventions ranging from tree planting to urban wind turbines and zero-emission buses.Taking the ideas further, the weekend will encompass a set of panel discussions, with representatives from the Greater London Authority, the  and Tidal Lagoon Power, the company behind the mooted  to share their views on the air pollution crisis and how to tackle it while, perhaps more creatively, a pollution-removing bench designed by  will be exhibited on the river terrace.Also on show is a specially commissioned installation by sound artist  based on six months＊ worth of air pollution data gathered by instruments in the area surrounding Somerset House. The aim, says Goatley, is to offer visitors an innovative way to explore pollution data, while pushing back against the perception that such figures and statistics are only for specialists.Entitled , the?experience involves a 360∼ soundscape with three different components of air pollution 每 nitrogen?dioxide, nitric oxide and particles known as PM10s 每 depicted by different sounds. These sounds, the?rush of traffic, a catalytic converter and the sound of a refinery are themselves linked through their relationship to a metal intricately involved in the problem of?air pollution: platinum.The sounds, notes Goatley, rise and fall in volume with the levels of the pollutant they represent, while the apparent direction of sound mimics the?direction and speed of the wind when the data was recorded. ※There is a very firm connection between what you hear and?what the data says 每 you can kind of read the data through the sound,§ he says, adding that the data is also depicted dynamically through a visual display.But Space to Breathe is not only about raising awareness of air pollution: it＊s also an attempt to put the?public back in control. Scientists will be offering visitors?the chance to try out some of the latest real-time pollution-monitoring technology, as well as revealing how web-based apps can be used to plan journeys and dodge pollution hotspots.※We will get people not just to think about what the pollution is on the day, but to actually have a perception of what their long-term exposures are likely to be,§ says Mudway. The hope, he adds, is that the experience will galvanise visitors into action, from the way they navigate cities to the cars they choose to?drive, and even encourage them to lobby those in power for change., a creative producer of the exhibition from Shrinking Space, agrees. ※Every single person can make a difference,§ he says."																																																			
"It has been billed as a  that entrepreneurs hope will make them rich while simultaneously transforming China＊s traffic-clogged cities.But, occasionally, dreams can turn sour.In the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, more than 500 bicycles for hire have been found dumped in huge piles on the streets, according to reports. Pictures showed jumbled stacks of vehicles nearly three metres high, with handlebars, baskets and other parts scattered on the ground.City streets around the country have seen an explosion of the colourful bikes that users can rent on demand with a smartphone app and then park wherever they choose.The sharing economy is taking off in , where ride-sharing and Airbnb are increasingly commonplace.From Shanghai to Sichuan province, bike-sharing schemes are being rolled out in an effort to slash congestion and air pollution by putting a country once known as the  back on two wheels.Companies such as Ofo and Mobike, with their rival fleets of bumblebee yellow and fluorescent orange bikes, have been locked in a cut-throat battle for customers.But problems have arisen when clients have abandoned their cycles.※Some people these days just have really bad character,§ a man named He, who lives near where the stacks appeared, told the Southern Metropolis Daily.※When they＊re done using [the bike] they just throw it away somewhere, because they＊ve already paid.§In the past few days he witnessed people demolishing the bikes before discarding them on the side of the road, he said.Residents told the paper that bikes had been piling up over the past week, either parked haphazardly by careless users or stacked by local security guards trying to clear narrow residential alleys and footpaths.Zhuang Chuangyu, a representative at Shenzhen＊s municipal people＊s congress, said the city needed to step up regulation of the bike-sharing industry in order to improve traffic conditions and safety standards, especially since schoolchildren often used the bikes.In the years following Mao Zedong＊s 1949 communist takeover, bikes ruled supreme in China and  每 the eastern equivalent of the  每 became one of the country＊s most recognisable symbols.But two-wheeled travel began to go out of fashion as China became more open to the world, ushering in decades of economic growth and a high demand for cars.

" is poised to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, according to multiple reports, in a move that would profoundly undermine the landmark agreement by nearly 200 countries to curtail global warming.Trump tweeted late on Wednesday that he would announce his final decision at 3pm ET on Thursday in the White House rose garden. It followed a wave of reports that he was about to exit from the deal. The reports follow his refusal to express support for global efforts to combat climate change at a G7 summit with European leaders last week.Should the , which was negotiated and ratified under Barack Obama, the country would join only Syria and Nicaragua as non-participants. The US had previously committed to a goal of reducing carbon emissions by 26-28% by 2025.On Wednesday afternoon during a press call with the Vietnamese prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Trump was asked if he was leaning toward getting out, to which he replied: ※You＊re going to find out very soon.§Asked whether he has been hearing from CEOs and others trying to persuade him on the climate agreement, Trump said: ※I＊m hearing from a lot of people, both ways. Both ways.§Shortly before, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he did not know if Trump has already made up his mind after listening to industry leaders and foreign leaders. ※He＊s had a lot of input and ultimately he＊ll make the decision,§ he said during an off-camera briefing that lasted only 12 minutes.A sombre Spicer told reporters: ※I think the president＊s comments on this, that he＊ll be making a decision on this in the next few days, stand.§Pressed further, he replied only: ※When the president has a decision he＊ll make that announcement and he＊ll make it clear what the basis of that is.§Asked about entrepreneur Elon Musk＊s threat to leave White House advisory councils if the US withdraws from the deal, Spicer said: ※Let＊s wait and see what the president＊s decision is. I don＊t want to get ahead of it.§The Trump administration has been divided on the issue, with the EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, and Trump＊s adviser Steve Bannon among the conservative hardliners who have been in favor of a US exit from the deal.  on Wednesday, said the details were being ironed out by a team led by Pruitt.Trump has dubbed climate change a hoax, and once tweeted that global warming was a concept ※created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive§. The US president nonetheless  during his first foreign trip since taking office to uphold the pact 每from world leaders and Pope Francis, who gave Trump his papal encyclical on climate change during their meeting at the Vatican.But the efforts to persuade Trump were ※very unsatisfactory§, according to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who observed: ※Here we have the situation that six members, or even seven if you want to add the EU, stand against one.§As with many of Trump＊s major decisions, news of his pending move leaked through anonymous sources that gave way to a reality TV-style narrative playing out before the public. The competing in-house factions were reportedly at war, with Pruitt and Bannon up against Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president＊s daughter and son-in-law, who despite attempts to paint themselves as moderating influences on the president so far have little to show for it.Some observers interpreted the spectacle as a trial balloon, by which officials were seeking to nudge Trump in either direction based on the reaction in the press.The environmental activist and author Bill McKibben said if reports were true, the president＊s planned move amounted to ※an incredibly stupid decision§ that would isolate the US not simply among its allies but much of the world. ※It ranks right up there with the worst decisions in American political history,§ said McKibben, . ※There＊s not a climate scientist in the world who thinks his arguments make sense.§The US ranks as the world＊s second-largest carbon polluter, and initial estimates by universities and thinktanks suggest its withdrawal would add up to 3bn tonnes of extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year, raising the global temperature by 0.1-0.3C (0.2-0.5F) by the end of the century. Environmentalists also fear the ripple effect Trump＊s decision might have on other major polluters, such as China and India, who have reiterated their commitment to the accord but could be emboldened to walk away in the face of similar action by the US.The US business community has been particularly vocal in the need to address climate change, which could have a devastating impact on the economy and jobs, according to research. One , published by Citigroup in 2015, estimated at least $44tn in cumulative ※lost§ GDP over the next five decades stemming from the effects of global warming. Major American companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and Goldman Sachs have in turn outlined ambitious targets in recent years to switch to 100% renewable energy.Brian Deese, a former senior adviser to Obama who oversaw the administration＊s agenda on climate, conservation and energy policy, said a move by Trump to withdraw from the Paris accord would amount to the US ※effectively stepping away from the table at a time when the global rules of the world are going to be written§.※We have a lot to gain from expanding clean energy and energy efficiency 每 they are some of the fasting growing sectors of our economy,§ Deese stold the Guardian.※Donald Trump can＊t cancel the Paris agreement, and he can＊t cancel the momentum that is behind it both diplomatically and economically,§ he added. Tillerson, the secretary of state, has urged the US to remain in the accord, which is backed by a majority of the American public. And while other countries have vowed to press on, with or without the US, its absence would leave the enforcement of the deal in a flux. The consequences would be especially profound for coastal cities facing rising sea levels, the protection of endangered species, and areas around the world already suffering from heatwaves and food insecurity.Trump has taken action in recent months to weaken the environmental legacy of the Obama administration by paving the way to overturn rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions and protect American waterways from pollution. During the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to ※cancel§ the Paris accord within his first 100 days of office.But Democratic mayors across the US have vowed to uphold the , even if the president withdraws.Responding to reports on Wednesday, the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, called the decision to leave the accord a ※dagger aimed straight at the heart§ of the president＊s native New York. ※The Paris Accord was the biggest step forward we＊ve taken in many years. It＊s unconscionable for the president to step away from it,§ De Blasio wrote on Twitter. ※But we＊ll take matters into our own hands.§At a press call later,De Blasio pledged to sign an executive order affirming the city＊s commitment to the accord if Trump pulled the US out of the accord. During a press conference on Wednesday, Boston＊s mayor, Marty Walsh, said that if the White House decided to withdraw, the responsibility to protect the environment would fall to cities. ※No matter what the president decides, I want to make it absolutely clear to the White House and our partners worldwide that the city of Boston will not back down. ※We will honor these responsibilities to our children and to our planet and we will do what is right,§ Walsh added. ※That＊s who we are in the city.§ The Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, a co-founder of Mayors National Climate Change Agenda, has said repeatedly that if the White House leaves the Paris deal, his city will adopt it independently.The Mayors National Climate Change Agenda sent a letter to the president in March urging him against rolling back US climate policy, including the Obama-era clean power plan, which Trump has proposed defunding. In the UK, meanwhile, in a televised debate ahead of the country＊s general election next week, leading politicians were critical of any US decision to leave Paris.

"The government is being forced to deliver an effective plan to tackle the UK＊s air pollution crisis within eight months, after a high court judge rejected a longer timetable as ※far too leisurely§.Environmental lawyers ClientEarth inflicted a  earlier in November 每 its second in 18 months 每 when the high court ruled that ministers＊ plans to tackle illegal levels of air pollution in many UK cities and towns were so poor they were unlawful.The  to the eight-month timetable proposed by ClientEarth for a new plan, saying it needed until September next year. But on Monday, Mr Justice Garnham ordered the government to produce a draft plan by until 24 April 2017 and a final one by 31 July 2017. Air pollution causes more than 40,000 early deaths and at least ?27.5bn in costs every year in the UK, according to the government＊s estimates, and was called a  by MPs in April. An earlier government plan to tackle air pollution  and ministers were ordered to produce a new strategy, . But that plan was also found not to meet the law＊s requirement of cutting nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution to legal levels in the ※shortest possible time§. James Thornton, the CEO of ClientEarth, said: ※It is very clear that the government must now act swiftly and decisively to protect British people from toxic and illegal air pollution. The government has said throughout this process that it takes air pollution seriously. Until now, it＊s actions have not lived up to this claim. Now is the time for the government to prove that it truly cares about people＊s health.§After the most recent court defeat, prime minister Theresa May said: ※There is more to do and we will do it.§ A spokeswoman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said on Monday: ※We are determined to cut harmful emissions. Our plans have always followed the best available evidence and we have always been clear that we are ready to update them if necessary. We can now confirm a timetable for updating our plans next year and further improving the nation＊s air quality.§The judge also ordered the government to publish the data on which it will base its new plan. Earlier in November he said it was ※remarkable§ that ministers knew they were using over-optimistic pollution modelling, based on flawed lab tests of diesel vehicles rather than , but proceeded anyway.The judge also ruled that ClientEarth can go back to court if it deems the government＊s draft plan, due in April, is once again not good enough to cut pollution rapidly. Alan Andrews, ClientEarth＊s air quality lawyer, said: ※We will be watching on behalf of everyone living in the UK and will return to court if the government is failing.§The existing government plan is for just six clean air zones (CAZs) 每 Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, Derby, Southampton and London 每 where some polluting diesel vehicles are charged to enter city centres. Andrews added: ※If the government are at all serious about complying with the court order, a national network of CAZs must be part of their plans, which means including the dirtiest diesel cars and creating far more than the current six.§ NO2 has been at illegal levels in 90% of the country＊s air quality zones since 2010 and stems largely from diesel vehicles.ClientEarth also argued in court that an effective plan would require other measures including a scrappage scheme for older diesel vehicles, retrofits of HGVs and more funding for public transport and cycling and walking schemes.Documents revealed during the recent high court case showed the for 16 CAZs in towns and cities blighted by air pollution, due to concern about the political impact of angering motorists.Both the environment and transport departments also recommended changes to vehicle excise duty rates to encourage the purchase of low-pollution vehicles. But the Treasury also rejected that idea, along with a scrappage scheme for older diesels."																																																			
"Donald Trump＊s  to make a decision on whether to remain in the Paris climate agreement this week promises resolution to months of fevered lobbying over US involvement in the global accord.But while America＊s traditional allies and environmental groups continue to urge Trump to stay within the Paris deal 每 in which nearly 200 nations have pledged to limit global temperatures to a 2C (3.6F) increase on the pre-industrial era 每 the actions of the US president, most recently at the  meeting in Sicily, have begun to provoke murmurs that perhaps the world would be better without American involvement.The final G7 communique saw the US unusually break with the other six nations by failing to commit itself to the Paris agreement, which Trump promised to ※cancel§ during the presidential campaign, and  he had decided to exit. The exasperation of European leaders suggested they are ready to move on with or without the world＊s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases.※The whole discussion about climate has been difficult, or rather very unsatisfactory,§ said German chancellor Angela Merkel. ※Here we have the situation that six members, or even seven if you want to add the EU, stand against one.§The US formally turning its back on perhaps the last best chance of a coordinated response to climate change would certainly carry heft. Frantic calculations by several thinkthanks and universities have estimated that US withdrawal would add up to 3bn tonnes of extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year, raising the global temperature by 0.1C (0.2F) to 0.3C (0.5F) by the end of the century.Such a regression would be compounded if other countries took the United States＊ lead and also decided to quit Paris, or at least not strive to fill the void in emissions reduction. This would have grave implications for coastal cities facing sea-level rise, parts of the world already blighted by heatwaves and food insecurity, and the planet＊s endangered species.While US emissions would start to level off rather than continue their gradual decline, there are signs that India and China, the two other national heavy hitters in emissions, are moving away from coal more quickly than expected, .This has led several economists and large US businesses to fret that the coming boom in solar, wind and other renewable energies will not take place in the US. China signaled its intent earlier this year by announcing it will invest $360bn in renewable energy by 2020, creating more than 13m jobs in the sector.If the economic fallout of leaving the Paris deal does not sway Trump, the diplomatic and security ramifications may. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, has urged the US to ※keep a seat at the table§ in order to maintain its international standing, while UN secretary-general Ant車nio Guterres has  the possibility of ※risks of conflict§ if climate change is not properly addressed.If Trump does decide to stay in the deal, it is likely he will attempt to ※renegotiate§ it, which would mainly involve the US revising down its goal of reducing emissions by 26-28% by 2025 based on 2005 levels. Opponents of the deal, such as Trump strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, have framed Paris as a ※bad deal§ for the US that may even hinder Trump＊s domestic agenda of winding back various environmental regulations.Several independent legal experts, as well as those who helped craft the Paris agreement, reject this view, pointing out that the edifice is built on a series of voluntary non-binding goals submitted by countries. Paris is essentially a statement of intent, a signal from governments to their citizens and businesses that low-carbon economies are on the way and that this inevitability should be financially supported.Some supporters of Paris are now wondering how useful it would be to have a disengaged US within such a structure. The American public is  of the Paris deal and could be given the misleading impression that their government is addressing the climate issue by simply staying put, despite tearing down Barack Obama＊s climate policies such as the clean power plan at the same time. ※Wanting the US to remain is a short-sighted, knee-jerk reaction,§  Luke Kemp, an expert in international environmental policy at the Australian National University. ※The international community should be much more worried about the real domestic actions of the US, rather than whether it is symbolically cooperating internationally.§Kemp points out that the US could act as a drag upon the international climate effort if it doesn＊t leave. ※The US and the  can do more damage inside the agreement than outside it,§ he said. The momentum is reportedly with the ※leave§ faction, with a group of 22 Republican senators 每 minus the notable voices of Lindsey Graham and John McCain, who want the US to remain 每  to make a ※clean break§ from Paris. On Tuesday, Trump again met with Pruitt, one of the most vociferous opponents of the deal. But the White House＊s confusion over the decision and its wider ramifications was perhaps summed up best by Sean Spicer, Trump＊s spokesman, who on Tuesday was asked the simple question of whether Trump believed global warming was spurred by human activity, a subject he has previously vacillated upon. ※Honestly, I haven＊t asked him,§ Spicer replied. ※I can get back to you.§"																																																			
"A Republican move to undo limits on the emission of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, has suffered an unexpected defeat in the Senate.A bill to repeal a Department of Interior  that reduces the venting, flaring and leaking of methane from oil and gas drilling on federal land failed by 51 votes to 49, with Republicans John McCain, Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham siding with Democrats to vote it down.The unexpected defeat is a blow to Republicans who .

"People living near noisy roads could have a bigger risk of high blood pressure, a new study suggests.Meanwhile, long-term exposure to air pollution can also increase a person＊s risk, experts found.The new study tracked 41,000 people in five different countries for up to nine years.An extra adult per every 100 living in the most polluted areas will develop high blood pressure compared with those living in the less polluted areas, the research suggests.The study, published in the , also found that traffic noise is associated with an increase in cases of hypertension.Researchers gathered information on 41,000 people from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Spain at the start of the study and again during a follow-up examination between five and nine years later.None suffered high blood pressure when they joined the study, but during the follow-up period 15% had developed hypertension or started to take blood pressure-lowering medications.The researchers also measured air pollution during three separate two-week periods.And they assessed traffic density outside the homes of participants.They found that people living in noisy streets, where there were average night-time noise levels of 50 decibels, had a 6% increased risk of developing hypertension compared to those living on quieter streets.And those living in areas with higher concentrations of polluting particles were significantly more likely to have self-reported high blood pressure.Lead author Barbara Hoffmann, professor of environmental epidemiology at at Heinrich-Heine-University of Dusseldorf, Germany, said: ※Our findings show that long-term exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with a higher incidence of self-reported hypertension and with intake of anti-hypertensive medication.※As virtually everybody is exposed to air pollution for all of their lives, this leads to a high number of hypertension cases, posing a great burden on the individual and on society.※Exposure to traffic noise shares many of the same sources with air pollution and so has the potential to confound the estimates of the adverse effects of pollution on human health. However, this study controlled for traffic noise exposure and found that the associations of air pollution with hypertension did not vanish. This is important because preventive measures for air pollution and noise differ.§But Prof Francesco Cappuccio of the University of Warwick, said: ※The present aggregate analysis suggests that whilst measures of air pollution across different European countries are associated with a greater risk of ＆self-reported＊ hypertension, there is no evidence of such an association with the incidence of ＆measured＊ hypertension.※This finding, understated in both the study＊s conclusion and in the press release, introduces a big note of caution. It is well recognised that the awareness of hypertension in the general population is weakly correlated with its presence when measured, and the lack of symptoms or signs often associated with it makes self-reported estimates unreliable, often biasing population hypertension estimates.§"

Rallies encouraging governments to divest from the fossil fuel industry were taking place in 46 different countries. In New York City, activists are pushing for comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city＊s $175bn pension funds, to divest investments in oil and gas companies like Exxon. The rally took place in one of two ※public gardens§ in Trump Tower, which as privately owned public spaces are open to members of the public. It included a quiz on which banks invest in fossil fuels, and a slightly on-the-nose tug-of-war which depicted Stringer being pulled in different directions by oil and gas companies and ※the people§. City council member Helen Rosenthal, state senator Liz Krueger and state assemblyman Felix Ortiz are among the elected officials also demanding that the city ditch its investments in fossil fuel industries.※By fully divesting New York City pension funds from coal, oil and gas, we would take a prudent step toward protecting 1.5 million pension holders, withdraw our support from companies that are driving climate change, and align our financial interests with our goals of moving toward a cleaner, fossil fuel-free energy system,§ Rosenthal said.A spokesman for Stringer said the comptroller did not have the power to unilaterally divest. The city＊s $175bn is spread across five different pensions, each of which has its own board of directors who decide where money will be invested.The rally, organized by 350.org and , is part of a series the groups have held in Trump Tower. Trump has not returned to the building, where his wife, Melania, and 11-year-old son Barron have lived since his inauguration in January. The first lady has said she and Barron will move to Washington at the end of the school year."																																																			
"ntibiotic-resistant superbugs are a fundamental threat to global health, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon recently told a general assembly meeting. Failure to address the problem, he said, would make it ※difficult if not impossible§ to provide universal healthcare, ※and it will put the sustainable development goals in jeopardy§.For pharmaceutical companies the attention on antimicrobial resistance has also brought a focus on one of its key drivers: the unabated environmental pollution of drug factories in developing countries. In India and China, where a large proportion of antibiotics are produced, the poorly regulated  into soils and rivers is causing the spread of antibiotic ingredients which cause bacteria to develop immunity to antibiotics, creating superbugs.A  of wastewater factories in China found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria were not only escaping purification but also breeding. For every bacterium that entered one waste treatment plant, four or five antibiotic-resistant bacteria were released into the water system, tainting water, livestock and communities. Superbugs are able to travel quickly through air and water, aboard airplanes and through global food supply chains. By 2050, the total death toll worldwide as the result of contracting an infection that proves resistant to treatment is expected to  (pdf).Environmental pollution is now a material issue for the pharmaceuticals sector. Global investors such as Nordea and BNP Paribas have raised concern about the potential damage to global health and environment, and are worried that a local factory pollution scandal in India could affect the  in their portfolio. As the world goes on a global quest to combat antimicrobial resistance, the focus on industry pollution will continue grow.Last month 13 pharmaceutical companies  (pdf) calling for collective action on antimicrobial resistance. They committed to review their manufacturing and supply chains and assess good practice in controlling releases of antibiotics into the environment. They also committed to establish science and risk-based targets for discharge concentrations of antibiotics and to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing discharges by 2020.Most global sectors now have a corporate platform where companies seek to tackle intractable sustainability challenges. For pharma companies, the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) was set up to demand better social and environmental conditions in the communities from where drugs are supplied. However,  of the 140 largest global pharmaceutical companies are members of PSCI according to sector analysts.Voluntary corporate initiatives are necessary but by no means sufficient to address the industry challenge of environmental pollution. This is partly because not every company signs up and partly because better government policies and law enforcement on the ground are necessary to ensure voluntary commitments are achievable. The governments where global pharma companies are domiciled 每 including the UK, US and Switzerland 每 must play a role. Companies must collaborate with governments to encourage and support a tougher stance on law enforcement in developing counties. At Earth Security Group we call this .The aid budget of agencies such as the UK Department for International Development could be used to strengthen pollution controls in sourcing countries such as . This would be a win-win for health in developing countries and for national business interests abroad.Many in the global pharmaceutical industry have called upon governments to  of the increasing antibiotic resistance, through their Declaration on Combating Antimicrobial Resistance. The signatories of this declaration and PSCI must now also urgently work with governments to achieve the goal of curbing environmental pollution in drug manufacturingUltimately, business diplomacy goes beyond corporate philanthropy and corporate social responsibility, by focusing on the deeper governance failures that threaten progress on sustainable development as well as the license to operate of global companies. Pharmaceutical companies now need to cooperate with governments, to root out pollution from their global supply chains."																																																			
"The government has stumped up ?3m to fund English local authorities＊ work to monitor and improve air quality.The air quality grant for 2016/17 was announced on 6 October and is six times greater than the amount allocated for the current financial year. It is the first funding round to be managed by DEFRA and the Department for Transport＊s?.Some ?2.36m was allocated when the fund was launched in 2010/11, rising to ?3.1m the following two years. But it fell to ?1m in 2013/14 and 2014/15.This was then cut further to only ?0.5m. The number of councils given cash to improve air quality dropped accordingly, falling from 36 to eight over the past three years. More councils in??than England received such funding this year.ENDS highlighted the steady reduction to the fund in?.So too did the Commons＊??(EFRA), which in April called on DEFRA to preserve funding and ensure that councils are ※recompensed for any costs of implementing new??which they are not able to recoup from reasonable charges on drivers§.Restoring the grant＊s budget may be interpreted as a response to such criticism.The grant may be sought for any location that DEFRA projects will exceed EU air quality limits, as reported to the European Commission, or had an air quality management area declared by the end of March 2016. Applications are due before midday on November 23.EFRA chair Neil Parish said: ※The government needs to act now to give all councils the power 每 and crucially, the funding 每?to implement a Clean Air Zone and limit the most polluting vehicles in hotspot areas. The ?3m government funding pot is a start, but not nearly enough. We also need a big push to incentivise electric and low-emissions vehicles to replace the oldest, most polluting vehicles.§In a response to a written parliamentary question by the MP, on 19 October the government revealed that more than a third (169) of the UK＊s 418 local authorities breached air quality limits on nitrogen dioxide in 2015. Breaches were reported in all four UK nations."																																																			
"rom Kartik Dhara＊s home, the trucks at the top of the garbage mountain look like the toys he sees city children playing with on his rounds of Kolkata. A garbage truck driver in the eastern Indian city, Dhara can＊t afford to buy toys for his own children, but he often finds discarded ones where he unloads rubbish every day. ※You can find everything there,§ he says.※There are dead babies, there are truckloads of smuggled chocolates or medicines that the excise department finds. I＊ve even found money and gold 每 a lot of gold. What do I do with it? I keep it in my house. When I＊m in a time of need, when there＊s a big difficulty in my life, I＊ll sell it and I＊ll use the money.§Dhara is one of around 30,000 people who live on and around Kolkata＊s landfill site at Dhapa. Garbage collectors like Dhara clean up after the city＊s , and dump around  at Dhapa every day. A garbage processing industry has since sprung up on the site. In the slums at the base of the mountains of rubbish, hundreds of people make a living as ragpickers or scrap dealers, by sorting the waste and recycling. In a cremation centre on site, unidentified dead bodies 每 most of them corpses of hawkers or street dwellers 每 are burned. Living and working on the landfill comes with serious health hazards that successive state and central governments continue to ignore. Inextinguishable fires burn all day and night, which pollute the air. They are so ubiquitous that the workers no longer complain about the fumes, and municipal authorities don＊t bother to put them out. Sovan Chatterjee, the mayor of Kolkata, says: ※Of course there are fires. There are so many waste materials there; they are going to be bad for the environment.§Dhara sees the fires every day when he＊s driving his truck up to the landfill site. ※The fires come on their own, from the garbage itself because of biogas,§ he says, referring to gasses produced as a result of fermentation of organic waste. ※They burn all day and all night, every day of the year.§ ※You can＊t go there,§ he says. ※Even our huge government trucks, even they fall and turn over sometimes. Especially now, in the monsoon, the garbage is wet and so the ground can fall beneath your feet anytime. Many trucks have been overturned on the mountain. People have died there.§※It＊s difficult to breathe sometimes,§ says Durga Mundun, who lives on top of the landfill. ※We get ill a lot. There＊s a lot of pollution and it smells very bad. Even though we live here and we＊re used to it, it bothers us a lot. People get sick, they get diarrhoea, they get tuberculosis.§He adds: ※Most people die by the age of 50. Sometimes they live till 60 and then they go up to God. I＊m already 30, I＊ll probably die soon too.§The landfill site at Dhapa was set up when Kolkata, then Calcutta, was the colonial capital of the British Raj in . A garbage train used to run along the main roads of the city collecting waste from all the big residential buildings and offices of the British administration. Since then, Kolkata＊s population has grown, and so has the amount of waste it produces. The landfill has grown into an entire landscape of garbage, which stretches for miles on the eastern fringes of the city. Kolkata municipal council has tried to find a new dumping site in the city, with hopes to reclaim what could become prime real estate at Dhapa, but their proposals have been rejected by civic bodies because of objections from local residents.India＊s  produce a whopping  every year. Prime minister Narendra Modi has launched a mass cleanliness drive called the  urging Indians to stop spitting and defecating on streets, to stop littering, and keep their local communities clean. In Kolkata, part of the state of West Bengal, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has launched a similar , installing 10,000 fibreglass bins and new garbage compactors to stop rubbish overflowing onto streets. As a result, Kolkata, like all of India＊s major metropolises, has become ostensibly cleaner; but politicians are still struggling to address the nub of the problem: mountains of untreated waste are still dumped into vast landfills, causing environmental degradation, and health problems for workers.***In one of the straw huts in the slum, Suhas Sau is bunching up discarded plastic bags and pushing them into a machine he made from old engines, bathtubs, and metal tubes. ※The bags go in from here,§ he ushers towards a hole at one end of the cylindrical machine. ※It＊s very hot inside, so they get melted, and they come out like this,§ he says, picking up a sticky black nugget that the machine spits out. ※Then we cut it, and we use it to make pipes.§ Sau set up his plastic recycling factory two and half years ago after a fight with his wife. ※She threw me out of the house,§ he says. ※I never went back; I live here alone. But I have no problems, I am happy here. For me, this isn＊t just a job, it＊s a way of life. This is the place where all of society＊s rejects end up, the people that nobody wants. This is our world.§ With acres of cheap, unbuilt land so close to the city, Kolkata＊s poorest people end up here hoping to make a living. Wages are low, and living conditions are cramped and unhygienic. Most people live and work in the same room.Jasmine Begum sorts plastics in a straw hut in the slum. ※When I started working here 10 years ago, I used to get 50 rupees (60p) a day, now I get 120. I sleep right here,§ she says, tapping on a wooden table in the room where she sorts through rubbish. ※I＊m a poor person, what do I do?§Begum came to Dhapa after both her parents died. ※I was young; I had nowhere else to go.§ She and other women in the slum try not to have children, because they know they won＊t be able to afford the costs of childcare. ※We don＊t have money to eat, how will we educate our children?§***At Dhapa thousands of plots of land are farmed for vegetables, the swamps have become fish farms and in the huts, women fry , a popular local street food. Though no one has ever measured how much of Kolkata＊s food comes from the landfill site, it is an open secret that the city＊s markets are stocked with produce from Dhapa. ※I grow spinach and cauliflower here,§ says Raju Yadav, a farmer who lives near the landfill site. ※The land is cheap and the fertiliser is free. I came here because there＊s nowhere else to go.§Urban development projects from Modi and Banerjee may have improved the city, but critics say they have done little to improve the lives of the people who feed and clean up after its residents. ※Go and look at New Town,§ says Yadav. ※Its like New York. Of course I support the government. They＊ve made our Kolkata look like London. So what if they haven＊t done anything for us? They can＊t work for particular people; they have to work for the whole city, for all its residents.§Chatterjee, who oversees the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, says his government does not have the funds to manage the landfill site at Dhapa. ※Being mayor, I want to see the landfill site but where do I get the money? They should pay to shift the site. Now we have become helpless, we can＊t help the people living there for more the 30 years. There are at least 20-30,000 houses on there and we can＊t do anything. We＊re helpless.§He says that food grown on the wasteland is safe for consumption. ※Kolkata＊s food on Dhapa land those have not caused any problems. It is checked by the environment minister, they＊ve given me data to prove it.§Chatterjee argues that politicians who to conserve international wetlands did not realise the scale of the garbage problem at Dhapa. His efforts to shift the dump further away from the city have failed because the new site chosen was protected by the Ramsar treaty. ※At the time of signing the convention, Kolkata municipal council was not consulted. We are the owners of 300-400 acres of wetland. ※It is the problem of the central government. When they are going to sign a treaty, they have to realise [the] actual practical position of the land, but they didn＊t consider this is in 1999. They are giving the directions to maintain the wetland site, but the convention did not give proper compensation to maintain the land.§ For Dhara, the government＊s failure to act to improve the lives of Dhapa＊s residents is unsurprising. ※We are poor people. Nobody helps poor people. We work so we can survive, and we will keep working.§"																																																			
																																																			
"he small Cessna plane banks steeply and J Henry Fair of Charleston, South Carolina, hangs his camera out of the small window to film straight down the chimneys of the Lafarge Tarmac cement plant in Aberthaw, south . ※Man, look at the gunk coming out of that guy. He＊s burning rubber as fuel! That＊s really environmental, huh?§ he shouts as the 25-knot, force six wind whips off the sea and tosses the light aircraft around. Fair asks the pilot to circle the plant three more times. From a few hundred feet above its great sheds and kilns it is clear that the 100-year-old works burn coal, waste and car tyres to make the cement. The wind takes the wisps of white smoke from the chimneys low over the surrounding farmland and beaches. Fair, who documents pollution and waste in the world＊s industrial sites, has come to Britain to conduct an aerial toxic tour of south Wales. Having set off from Swindon in Wiltshire and passed over solar farms, unspoilt valleys, ancient villages and some of the richest farmland in Europe, he approaches over the Bristol Channel. What he sees delights and shocks him. Wales is bathed in a low autumn sunlight revealing a vivid industrial landscape of derelict steel works, demolished factories, old smokestacks, sewage and waste plants, holding tanks, pipelines and chimneys. A few wind turbines rotate, but from 1,700 ft, this bastion of the world＊s industrial revolution appears a calm picture of emptiness and past enterprise. Docks with no ships, factories with no workers, derelict plant and chimneys without smoke, he says. ※What impresses [on] me is the sadness at the disappearance of all those jobs. The industry there has just been shipped overseas,§ he says.Instead it is the patterns and vivid colours of the contamination and detritus left by the industrial age which excites him. ※I am obsessed by them,§ he says, as the Cessna passes over bright green, brown and orange settling ponds, tanks and jet-black coal heaps being flattened by minute yellow machines. Fair calls himself an artist and environmental activist. ※I am appalled by the subject I photograph but I love what I see in old industry. I want to know how much mercury or carbon is being emitted from a factory, but I also have the artists＊s horror of what I am seeing.§ ※What does this do?§ he asks as the Cessna passes over the Dow Corning chemical works near Barry. The plant, which has been operating for 100 years, makes silicone products used in nearly every industrial process. But it is also making more than 100 people redundant. ※Nothing here is natural. Look, they are bringing coal ash from the power plant and they＊re growing crops right next to it. That＊s just brilliant,§ he says sardonically. The Cessna turns 180 degrees to head for the nearby Aberthaw coal power plant, which the  had repeatedly violated pollution controls for nitrogen oxide emissions. ※Let＊s get those waste stacks. They don＊t look like they＊re doing anything nice,§ says Fair.He spots the power plant＊s offshore cooling water intakes and outflows that are creating abstract, expressionist patterns in the mudflats and sea. ※That tells me they are dumping hot water into the bay which is going to affect the marine life. What about its waste coal ash? Where does all that go?§ he asks.Back on the ground, Fair says his environmental images must be both meaningful and beautiful to work. ※Art that is beautiful but not meaningful is decoration. Art that is meaningful without beauty is pedantic. I want to make art that tells a story to regular people; art which hopefully gives them an insight into our world.※What we buy doesn＊t come with information about the hidden costs: the air that is fouled, the water contaminated, the habitat destroyed, or the workers exploited. But these are real costs that must inevitably be paid, a burden that ultimately falls on all of us.§US environmentalist Bill McKibben says: ※Think of these images as a surveillance camera for the planet, recording the biggest crimes against nature we＊ve ever imagined. Images like these will be the standards around which we muster.§ But Fair says he seeks to combine horror and beauty. ※What I see in these scarred landscapes is both beauty and the complete disregard for nature.§"																																																			
"his morning . This was a Black Lives Matter action. Since then our phones have been ringing constantly, with requests to explain, and comment on the action.※But how is this in any way linked to the  on 5 August? Aren＊t you moving away from the original narrative of deaths in police custody?§ we＊re being asked.The aim of that last action, when  shut down major traffic arteries in Birmingham, London, Manchester and Nottingham, was to re-centre the conversation around black lives, here in the UK. In a  we released two days before the action, figures such as Marcia Rigg, whose brother , spokespeople from  and others laid out our message for the world to hear. And it was clear that in police custody, in prisons, in employment, in education and on our streets.Today we are saying that the climate crisis is a racist crisis. On the one hand . It is also one of the least vulnerable to the effects of climate change. On the other hand, seven of the 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change are in .We＊re not saying that climate change affects only black people. However, it is communities in the global south that bear the brunt of the consequences of climate change, whether physical 每 floods, desertification, increased water scarcity and tornadoes 每 or political: conflict and racist borders. While a tiny elite can fly to and from London City airport, sometimes as a daily commute, this year alone  or gone missing in the Mediterranean, trying to reach safety on the shores of Europe.Why are communities like east London＊s Newham, where 40% of the population survive on ?20,000 or less, hosting airports such as London City, where passengers earn on average ?114,000 a year? When we say black lives matter, we mean  black lives, and that includes the lives of those who live in proximity to airports, to power plants, to the busiest of roads, and whose children grow up with asthma, and skin conditions exacerbated by air pollution. Black British Africans are .We are coming under fire for the fact that the protesters on the runway today were all white. That is not an accident. Black Lives Matter UK is and has always been black-led. It should not be surprising that black people could pull something like this off. And it should not be surprising that we would be able to find nine white people who believe that black lives matter. There is a need for white people to take responsibility in a society that privileges them through racism and anti-black racism.And following our previous day of action, when protesters arrested in Nottingham claimed that  because of the colour of their skin, it is surely welcome to have white allies putting their bodies on the line.For too long, the issues of climate change and race have been portrayed as separate. From Newham to Mogadishu, from Brixton to Bahia, black lives matter."																																																			
"We decided to go to Malta because we were fed up with the inactivity from NGOs about the endless trapping and killing of migratory birds there.We first went four years ago, then started to go annually to liaise with the Committee Against Bird Slaughter. It is an incredible organisation that attracts volunteers from all over Europe. When we first went, we put a video report online every evening showing what was happening 每 a daily diary detailing the killing of birds 每 and we got an enormous amount of press for this.This time, we went after the shooting?season to show how the legislation to protect birds was being abused. I was accused of assault and was taken to court. I knew I would be exonerated as we had recorded the whole incident.This sort of intimidation is commonplace, and allowed us to expose?the difficulty those who fight the?killing of birds face every day. We?are?now urging the public, through social media, to get involved. I am a firm?believer that sometimes the best way to make?a?change is to make trouble. The?attempted intimidation I witnessed this week only?fuels the fire.I will be on Earth Day＊s March for Science today because I strongly believe that evidence-based decision-making should be at the forefront of the political agenda. Today, decisions are being made through self-interest, and not science-based facts. However, I am aware that when you take this stand, you open yourself up to an enormous amount of bullying and abuse. That has become very much part of my life. I?am not intimidated by it. As proven by my experience in Malta, intimidation is possibly the worst thing my opponents can do, as it only shows their lack of reason. I?have faith in the science to prove my?arguments.We have gone through a period of people being very disillusioned with environmental activism, but now I think we are going to see a surge in democratic, peaceful and effective action, as caring is not enough. We must take action. I?want to try to slow the juggernaut of decay and destruction that is so damaging our environment and all the other species we share it with. I?see that as a duty. I just want to keep enough of it alive so that when we are able to elect decision-makers who will follow this through, there will be enough left to save.Whether this means saving the trees in Sheffield or the birds currently being slaughtered in Malta, we have to keep going."																																																			
"I＊m 24 years old, and I believe that water and climate change are the defining issues of my generation. The way I see it, listening is a form of activism.This Saturday I will be in Washington DC for the People＊s Climate March, and I will have my audio recorder with me as part of my mission to collect 1,001 audio interviews about how climate change and water have impacted their lives.My journeys as a poet-activist-touring cyclist began three years ago at the People＊s Climate March in New York. I wore a cardboard sign around my neck that said ※tell me a story about water§ on one side and ※tell me a story about climate change§ on the other, joining a rising tide of 400,000 activists.That day people told stories about all sorts of things: of the health impacts of paper mill pollution on a community in northern China; climate change＊s threats to Vermont＊s maple syrup industry; and the experience of being stuck in an office building for 62 hours during Hurricane Sandy.Since the 2014 People＊s Climate March I have been traveling through 11 countries, mostly by bicycle (and sometimes by boat). To date I have recorded interviews with more than 600 storytellers in the US, Fiji, Tuvalu, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Qatar, Morocco and the UK. You can follow my progress on my .Here is a sample of some of the stories I have recorded on my journeys so far.I met Rebecca and her daughter Athena at the September 2014 People＊s Climate March in NYC. At the time, Athena was five months old; she slept on her mother＊s chest as we walked. Rebecca told me that she and her husband moved to Ojai, California because they wanted to ※start a family and get out of the big city of Los Angeles.§ ※We moved to a five acre avocado ranch in Ojai and we have 300-plus avocado trees,§ Rebecca said. ※Our whole goal is to build and create this farm so that we could raise our daughter Athena that she could live on for her whole life and have her children.§ Their goal was to have a farm that could be passed down through generations. A prolonged drought made that goal more complex than Rebecca anticipated. ※We＊re now at the end of a five year drought and our water is running out, and so our trees are extremely thirsty,§ she said at the time. ※The cost of water is soaring. We＊re not sure if we＊re going to be able to keep our trees or not because of how water consumptive it is.§ All of the water in Ojai comes from Lake Casitas. After five years of drought, the reservoir was then on its last reserves. ※The climate, just since we＊ve moved to Ojai, has completely changed,§ Rebecca said, ※and so our big dream and our vision of moving to this beautiful place where we could grow our own food and we could live sustainably on the earth is starting to die, quite literally. It＊s drying up.§ The highest point on this low-lying  nation in the Pacific is only four meters (12.5ft) above sea level. With a population just shy of 11,000, Tuvalu is one of the smallest and most remote countries on the planet.I lived in Tuvalu for a month, from December 2014 to January 2015, and during that time I made friends with Losite, a Tuvaluan my age, who invited me to the outer island of Nukufetau to spend Christmas with her family.Losite＊s mother, Nisikata, works as a primary school teacher in Nukufetau. We sat overlooking the sea. She told me the story of a drought that lasted from April to December 2013: ※Our local taro crops [and] the fish died because of the drought,§ she said. ※We usually get water from rain. And when we [went to] fetch water from our tank ＃ it＊s all empty.※The underground well water [was] also salty,§ Nisikata said. ※There used to be a freshwater lens under Tuvalu. In the last 15 years, due to sea level change, that freshwater lens has become salty and impossible to drink.§※With the drought, so many things that affected our life, like our livestocks. We depend on pigs, [and were] also facing problem by finding food. Coconuts are not bearing fruit ＃ green nuts are all falling down. [It was] very hard to find anything to drink,§ she said.※Donors from overseas gave bottles of water and those waters [were] distributed to each island and also into schools by the government of Tuvalu. And from there we can survive.§ Rations of food were also provided to each island. ※Bit by bit we used those and when we run out of the ration, the government still providing us with more until we were back again to our normal weather: sunny, warm and then sometimes rain.§I met Dr Mike Joy, a senior lecturer at Massey University, during my bike trip down the length of Aotearoa. Joy told me this story from his home in the Horowhenua, on the lower north island, in February 2015. ※Water and climate change are totally interrelated here, as I guess they are everywhere,§ Joy said. ※As a country we are going along a very clear path towards maximizing agricultural production. Our government has decided that it wants to double agricultural production in the next decade or two.※We already have extreme effects of intensification of farming,§ he said. ※62% of the length of all our rivers in the country are unswimmable through pathogens, mostly from farming but also from urban impacts.※Pretty much anywhere in lowland New Zealand you＊ll find polluted waterways, and in the conservation estate, which is mostly the alpine areas, we have amazingly clean lakes and rivers,§ Joy said. With the intensification of dairy agriculture, ※we now have 6.5m dairy cows in this country,§ Joy said. ※If you want to think about the impact of 6.5m dairy cows, a very conservative comparison is that one dairy cow produces as much waste as 14 humans. So you multiply that out ＃ a country the size of the United Kingdom and has 90 million human equivalents.§ The current human population of New Zealand is 4.8 million: ※The waste from these animals doesn＊t get some form of treatment like human waste would in a developed country. It mostly just goes into waterways.※The other big downside to that is more than 50% of our greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, and so we effectively, while our CO2 emissions are relatively OK because we＊re quite a low human population, our greenhouse gas emissions in total are massively increasing,§ Joy said.※We trade on this clean green image, but in reality we＊ve trashed an amazingly unique and diverse country, and we＊ve trashed it in the name of producing a very low-value commodity 每 that＊s milk powder. Of the milk that＊s traded in the world, more than 35% of it comes from New Zealand. We＊re a major player in global markets, but only at the cheapest possible end of the scale.§And at what cost? ※The other reality that＊s well hidden here is that New Zealand has the highest proportion globally of threatened species overall. We have the highest incidence of waterborne diseases of any developed country as well.§Partway through my six months of cycling up Australia＊s east coast, I pedalled through Wooyung, in New South Wales. Enticed by hand-painted signs for peaches, nectarines, lychees and mangoes, I pulled into Wooyung Rd Fruit and Vegetable Stall. I propped my bicycle next to an array of coconuts. I bought a banana and a nectarine and listened as Terry, a lifelong farmer in Wooyung, told me the story of how floods are more unpredictable than ever before. He said: ※Here we used to get floods in January, February. March was your wet monsoon. Now they can come any time from winter. The biggest flood we had, 2005, was the end of June 每 34 inches in about three days.§This unpredictability impacts which crops Terry is able to plant. ※There＊s risk planting any crops on the flats now,§ Terry said. ※You used to be able to plant watermelons, rockmelons, and things on the flats and you seldom got flooded out before maybe January, February. Now, anytime, there＊s such a risk,§ he said. ※Too much money involved to put many crops down on the flats,§ Terry said."

There＊s something gloriously gossipy about their courting call, as they throw back their heads, but something debonair too, in their pied haughtiness. There is a visible preponderance of drakes, an imbalance on Foulney that is not yet fully understood.Eiders swallow mussel shells whole, crushing them in the gizzard, and the shingle was littered with blue and white aggregates of expelled mush. The mussel beds are currently open for dredging, but there are restrictions in place, and eider are faring well locally.

"Australia＊s big four banks have all ruled out funding or withdrawn from Adani＊s  coal project, after Westpac said it would not back opening up new coalmining regions, prompting a scathing attack from the resources minister, Matthew Canavan.Westpac, the country＊s second-largest bank, released a new climate policy on Friday, saying it would limit lending for new thermal coal projects to ※only existing coal producing basins§.The coal mined must also have energy content ※in at least the top 15% globally§, meaning at least 6,300 kilocalories per kg, according to the Westpac policy.Adani＊s Carmichael mine would be the first in the Galilee basin and the coal would have only 4,950 kilocalories per kg, the miner told the Queensland land court in 2014.Canavan, thealso the minister for northern Australia, invited Queenslanders seeking home loans or term deposits to boycott Westpac as a result of its decision.※I can only conclude from this decision by Westpac that they are seeking to revert to their original name as the Bank of New South Wales, as they are turning their back on Queensland as a result of this decision,§ he said.※May I suggest those Queenslanders seeking a home loan or a bank deposit or some such in the next few months might want to back a bank that is backing the interests of Queenslanders.§Canavan also accused Westpac of turning its back on ※the Indigenous people of Queensland§ because of majority support for the project among Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners, although this is .The Queensland senator castigated the bank for ※almost zero consultation with the people of north Queensland§, saying it was ※more interested in listening to the noisy activists in Sydney than the job hungry people§ in his constituency.Westpac has come under pressure from environmental groups and various activist campaigns, including one that  and a rally that  in Sydney this month.Adani＊s final investment decision on Carmichael had been  but the company subsequently said it would be  before mine construction from August.An Adani Australia spokesman said the company had not approached Westpac for funding for the mine, rail or port expansion.But Blair Palese, the chief executive of climate advocacy group , said Westpac＊s decision represented ※an enormous blow to this project and the future of coal in Australia§.Palese said the federal and Queensland governments, which both support the proposed mine, were ※becoming increasingly isolated as businesses and international investors refuse to touch coal and the Adani project§.※After months of community pressure, Westpac＊s announcement is a strong indication that people everywhere are ready to stop this climate disaster in its tracks and that Adani and our government ignore them at their peril,§ he said.Adani is seeking a $1bn concessional loan from the commonwealth for its rail project linking the mine to its Abbot Point coal terminal.On Thursday Andrew Harding, the CEO of Adani＊s rival Aurizon,  his company could build the line for ※at least $1bn less§ than Adani＊s proposal, with fewer land acquisitions and less impact on the environment. Adani wrote off that suggestion as ※fanciful and monopolistic§.※The so-called plan is a smokescreen aimed at defending Aurizon＊s expensive monopoly of coal rail lines in Queensland,§ Adani said. ※The Aurizon plan is designed to instil fear and stifle hope in the people of regional Queensland.§The CEO of Westpac, Brian Hartzer, also said the bank would increase its lending target for ※climate change solutions§ from $6.3bn to $10bn by 2020 and $25bn by 2030.※Westpac recognises that climate change is an economic issue as well as an environmental issue, and banks have an important role to play in assisting the Australian economy to transition to a net zero emissions economy,§ Hartzer said. ※Limiting global warming will require a collaborative effort as we transition to lower-emissions sectors, while also taking steps to help the economy and our communities become more resilient.§Adani previously received a $543m loan facility in two deals with Westpac, alongside others from Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank, to acquire a 99-year lease on the Abbot Point terminal, according to the climate advocacy group Market Forces.NAB  in September 2015, a month after Commonwealth Bank parted ways with Adani as project finance adviser.The CEO of ANZ, Shayne Elliott,  last December when he predicted a downward shift in the bank＊s exposure to coalmining would continue for the foreseeable future.Critics of the Adani proposal, which would be Australia＊s largest and one of the world＊s largest coal mines, argue the impact of carbon emissions from its coal is incompatible with global attempts to limit warming to less than 2C.Canavan said Adani＊s target markets in India and north Asia would simply source lower quality coal with higher emissions elsewhere, a conclusion he said was shared by the Queensland supreme court in its  of a ※green activist claims§ against the mine.The Adani spokesman said the company was ※fervently committed§ to the project ※despite Westpac and other Australian financial houses choosing to ignore the opportunity to invest§.※The financial houses have, instead, chosen to bow to environmental activists,§ he said. ※In so doing, they have chosen to continue to invest in overseas coal projects that will generate jobs in those countries at the expense of Australians, many of whom are their investors and depositors.§The Carmichael coal ※easily meets the emissions standards announced by Westpac§, the spokesman said."																																																			
"Officials in Borneo have cancelled plans to build a bridge across the Kinabatangan river, after warnings from Sir David Attenborough and other conservationists that it would gravely endanger pygmy elephants, orangutans and many other jungle species. The news comes just weeks after .Attenborough originally sent a private letter to the chief minister of the state of Sabah, Musa Aman, in September 2016. Last month, with signs pointing to the bridge still going ahead, the Guardian published excerpts from the letter. The authorities in Borneo have described Attenborough＊s now-public opposition as the final blow to the project.※I am immensely pleased to hear that plans to build a bridge at Sukau have been cancelled,§ said Attenborough, who is a patron of the , which has saved forest in the Kinabatangan area. ※This region is recognised worldwide as being a vital enclave for threatened wildlife, and it is indeed good news that the safe passage of orangutans, pygmy elephants and other endangered wildlife will not be threatened by the bridge and all that would have come with it. The decision will [also benefit] the local people who welcome visitors who come to see the wonderful biodiversity of their forests.§Datuk Sam Mannan, Sabah Forestry Department＊s chief conservator, announced the state government＊s decision on 19 April at a dinner in London held by the South East Asia Rainforest Research Partnership. ※That headline broke the camel＊s back,§ Mannan said of the Guardian＊s coverage. ※It made us understand that the issue of a proposed bridge across a protected area for wildlife is now the number one environmental concern not just in Sabah, but globally too.§The bridge would have spanned 350m, linking the village of Sukau with Litang and Tommanggong. While many locals supported it as a means to improve travel in the region, conservationists feared it would further imperil wildlife. Sukau is adjacent to the , which is a popular eco-tourism site. Attenborough himself has visited the region several times.Over the years the sanctuary has been hemmed in by spreading palm oil plantations, which have fragmented forests and blocked migratory routes for wildlife. Bornean elephants 每 the world＊s smallest 每 are considered endangered by the , with a global population of only around 1,500. Bornean orangutans are listed as . As they have lost their habitat, both species have seen increased run-ins with humans, including poachings and poisonings.

Last weekend, Backshall and his wife, Olympic champion rower Helen Glover,  to raise funds for the World Land Trust＊s work in the area.※It＊s a narrow wildlife corridor, allowing dispersal of a myriad of species big and small,§ Blackshall said. ※Fragmenting of this habitat 每 already beleaguered by ever-encroaching plantations 每 would be catastrophic. The decision to halt the Sukau bridge is a reason for great celebration.§Experts have said there are alternatives to the bridge, including building further downstream or improving existing infrastructure. ※The chief minister of Sabah has taken everyone＊s views into consideration 每 including Sir David＊s 每 before deciding on this very important issue, and I am pleased to say that balanced development has prevailed,§ Mannan said."																																																			
"hat is it about  that has made them such classic icons of sexual reproduction? It cannot be timing, because their breeding is often over before the other elements of high spring 每 flowers, bees, birdsong, sunshine 每 are in full flood.

I have often found that frogs are most vocal on late-winter nights, and the little burp of toads, which is more creak than croak, is so quiet one has to strain to pick it out. The soft, even, purring of frogs is sweeter but, as one herpetologist noted, a pondful of thousands in full throat was completely inaudible just 50m away.One aspect must surely be the volume of their fertilised eggs, as well as their richly suggestive physical form. When I was a child I loved to run my hands through the pond water to get the strange claggy jelliness of it. Here at Lightwood, less than 1km from where I was born, the frogs＊ reproductive labours have been prodigious. There＊s one immense reef of spawn and when I spotted a lone toad doing a breast-stroke through it, the old man＊s legs sculling in perfect synchrony, it reminded me a little of a bird passing through dark cloud.I suspect what really compels our imaginations is their sheer drive.

"When does a social attitude become morally unacceptable enough that it is OK to challenge and confront it?That is the question that motivated a  conducted at the University of Exeter in which participants were given descriptions of people being confronted after expressing certain views. When the views expressed a disregard for racial equality, the confrontations were approved of. But challenging 每 even politely 每 a disregard for climate change was seen as carrying a social cost by the students taking part in the experiment. Participants in the study felt less warm towards the character in the scenario (and were less likely to want to be friends with them) when they challenged views .The findings add to a  of research showing the importance of social norms in guiding people＊s attitudes and behaviours. But they might also tell us something important about the value of publicly debunking climate change contrarians.Clearly, neither people nor the planet are well-served by accepting, propagating or ignoring myths and falsehoods. But the potential collateral damage caused by challenging climate denial is important to consider too.

Bridging the ideological divide on climate change is essential. But that means changing the prevailing social norms 每 not ignoring them.While a lot of attention has been given to communicating the  on climate change and concerns raised about the fact that people consistently underestimate it, the social consensus may be just as important.Several  have shown that while most people in the UK are in favour of renewables, they don＊t think other people are.  continuing  around climate change and the , the sense that other people don＊t care is widespread 每 even when they do. Emphasising positive social norms is an important way of dispelling misconceptions around others＊ views, and can help build momentum for a society to move towards lower carbon emissions.A commitment to the truth is a non-negotiable component of any credible communication around climate change, but campaign strategies also need to go with the grain of human behaviour. And if the unsettling swing towards ※post-truth§ discourse has taught us anything, it is that being right is not the same thing as being persuasive.

"While the Trump administration is veering sharply toward climate science denial, 19 House  have taken steps to pull the party in the direction of reality, and the need to combat the threats posed by human-caused climate change.Last week, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY), Congressman Carlos Curbelo (R-FL), and Congressman Ryan Costello (R-PA) led a group of 17 House Republicans in  that calls on Congress to develop policies to tackle climate change. The Republican Climate Resolution recognizes that environmental stewardship is a conservative principle, that policies should be based on scientific evidence and quantifiable facts, that climate change is having negative impacts and is viewed by the Department of Defense as a threat multiplier, and that we can and must take meaningful action to address these threats in a manner that doesn＊t constrain the American economy:The Resolution has thus far been signed by House Republicans representing districts in New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Nevada, Nebraska, Virginia, New Jersey, Utah, Washington, and South Carolina. Eleven of the Resolution＊s signatories are also members of , as are Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Lee Zeldin (R-NY), who have not yet signed the Resolution. The Climate Solutions Caucus is a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives 每 currently comprised of 13 Republicans and 13 Democrats 每 that explores policy options to address climate change. Caucus members include some prominent conservative Republicans. Darrell Issa is the former chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Mia Love is viewed as a rising star in the party. Love featured in an episode of the acclaimed program :Altogether, this makes 19 Republican members of the House of Representatives calling for or developing policies to tackle climate change.The Republican Climate Resolution also follows a proposal by eight Republican elder statesmen in the Climate Leadership Council 每 including Secretaries of State and Treasury to former Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush 每 . The group met with the White House to urge support for this policy. Were President Trump to throw his support behind this bipartisan, free market, small government, , along with the support of these 19 House Republicans, the policy might conceivably gain momentum in Congress.Republican voters would also support this shift.  a tax or regulations on carbon pollution, or both. While these voters don＊t view climate change as an urgent threat or high priority, and thus aren＊t too bothered by their party＊s general climate denial and policy obstruction, they would nevertheless prefer that Republican policymakers take steps to address the threats posed by climate change.It would certainly be a smart move for the Republican Party. The current party policy involves rejecting decades＊ worth of scientific evidence and , and rolling back all of the progress America has made to address the threats posed by climate change.

"The UK government  that almost all its efforts to cut air pollution in recent years have been driven by EU legislation.There is one reason why air pollution was a big issue in the  and why the government is facing a : the .The directive became law in 2010 and set limits for nitrogen dioxide, a toxic gas produced by diesel vehicles. .The history of Europe＊s influence on the air Britons breathe dates back to the 1970s when the UK joined the EEC, with the clean air directive just the latest in a series of EU air quality laws that have tackled air pollution in Britain.Some factors in driving down certain pollutants were in train without the EU＊s influence. For example, sulphur dioxide (SO) was already declining in the 1970s and 80s as heavy industries closed and coal and oil declined.But experts say further action was driven by the UK＊s membership of the EU. ※There is no question that EU air protection legislation has over many years, and still very much continues to, affect measures taken in the UK, leading to air quality improvements,§ found .MPs backed that conclusion in March, with ※the EU has led the UK to improve environmental standards in areas such as air and water pollution and biodiversity§.James Thornton, chief executive of ClientEarth, the environmental lawyers who won a court case against the government over pollution last year, said: ※It＊s not just  that＊s bonkers and ill-considered, it appears that Boris [Johnson] is just as bonkers for wanting us to leave the EEA [European Economic Area].

"irst established in 1996 and occurring every five years, the State of the Environment report is prepared by independent authors and provides a report card across nine thematic areas 每 the Antarctic environment, atmosphere, biodiversity, built environment, coasts, heritage, inland waters, land and the marine environment.The report will this year for the first time be available in an interactive digital format, expanding its reach and ensuring greater use and engagement from the academic and broader community.Like previous reports, this year＊s document has its bright spots while also indicating a number of areas where there is much more to do.Good progress has been made in the management of the marine and Antarctic environments, natural and cultural heritage and the built environment, while pressures are building in relation to invasive species, climate change, land use and coastal protection.The number of people in Australia has doubled over the past 50 years. Growing urbanisation (two-thirds of the population live in our capital cities and 90% of people live in 0.22% of Australia＊s land area) and heightened economic activity (Australia is experiencing its 26th year of consecutive economic growth) have combined to contribute to additional pressures on the environment.The message, however, is not that development and sustainability are locked in a zero-sum game. Far from it. Rather, we must be conscious of these pressures, prepare for them and put in place a coordinated, comprehensive, well-resourced long-term response.Failure to do so will have a direct and detrimental impact on our quality of life and leave a legacy to future generations that is inferior to the one we have inherited. This is why reports such as this are important and why we must continue to upgrade our capacity to collect and analyse critical environmental data.It＊s also why last November I committed 每 along with state and territory environment ministers 每 to develop more detailed environmental accounts for Australia to build this capacity to better understand our environment and how best to protect it. The report indicates that the Antarctic is in ※generally good condition§, with evidence that the phasing out of powerful synthetic greenhouse gases, in which Australia has played a lead role under the , is leading to improvements in the ozone layer.Macquarie Island, which has seen rabbits and rats in plague proportions, is also recovering well following a successful invasive species eradication policy. more generally are a growing problem. We are all familiar with the devastation that has been unleashed across our continent by the arrival of cane toads, feral pigs and yellow crazy ants. But feral cats should top this list because their population growth and diet of marsupials, birds and reptiles make them one of the biggest threats to a number of nationally listed species.The good news is that the federal government has acted in implementing a new threatened species strategy and appointing the first threatened species commissioner. However, there is a big task ahead with the addition of 44 animal and five plant species to the threatened species list, meaning there are now 545 animal and 1,312 plant species under threat.One notable mention in the report was that humpback whales are increasing in number to a point where their current listing as ※vulnerable§ may need to be reconsidered.Australia＊s 108 national and 19 world heritage sites are admired both here and abroad and are integral to our cultural history and values. They remain, according to the report, ※generally in good condition§, but the Great Barrier Reef last year was subject to a , with climate change and the El Ni?o effect to blame.Conscious of the threat to this natural wonder of the world, the federal government is jointly investing with the Queensland government $2bn to support our  to improve water quality and preserve the health of the reef.Australia has a strong reputation in management of its national reserve system. Since 2011, the Ningaloo Reef has been added and extensions made to the Tasmanian wilderness and Kakadu properties on the World Heritage List. Since 2012, 12 new places have been added to the National Heritage List, including the Snowy Mountains scheme in New South Wales and Lesueur national park in Western Australia, ensuring that our historic places are preserved for future generations.The report indicates that the impact of changing weather patterns is affecting biodiversity and species habitat.While carbon emissions per capita have declined from 24.1 tonnes in 2011 to 22.2 tonnes in 2015, and energy efficiency improvements are reducing electricity demand, the report makes clear that, for the world to meet its Paris goals, there is much more to do.Land clearing also comes in for attention in the report. With the exception of Queensland, land clearing rates over the past five years ※have stabilised in all states and territories§ and Indigenous protected areas have substantially increased.Since 2008 there have been an additional 42 agreements and 20.6m hectares which are now covered under the Indigenous protected areas. The national reserve system, protecting important natural assets, has expanded to cover 17.9% of Australia＊s land are, compared with 13.4% in 2011.These are all significant improvements which are felt right across the environmental food chain as pollination, seed disposal and species＊ survival rely on an ecosystem where vegetation and habitat are protected.Despite the growth in urban population, air and urban water quality remain ※good§ according to the report, with ※noticeable local improvements in water quality in the Murray Darling basin§. Sustainable diversion limits and water efficiency are having a positive impact on the fish and water bird stocks as well as natural vegetation. There is no room for complacency. Regardless of one＊s political persuasion, we all have a vested interest in protecting our commons.The Coalition track record in this regard is strong. The Environmental Protection and  Conservation Act, like the Natural Heritage Trust and the first mandatory renewable energy target, were all initiatives of the Howard government.The 10-year  was implemented by Malcolm Turnbull.Former prime ministers Tony Abbott, Malcolm Fraser, William McMahon, John Gorton, Harold Holt and Robert Menzies all too had significant achievements to their name.The task now is to build on this proud Coalition tradition and to use this report to continue the good work the government is doing across so many areas of environmental policy."																																																			
"People living in some of London＊s most deprived areas have up to twice as much chance of dying from life-threatening lung conditions 每 from cancer to asthma 每 as those in the richest areas, .The research, by the  charity, prompted the mayor of London, , to call for urgent measures to improve air quality and reduce pollution in the capital.The British Lung Foundation conducted a major study, called , into respiratory health and diseases across the UK, finding that these illnesses are responsible for about a fifth of deaths nationwide.  came out over a week ago, but London figures were published on Monday. It found that residents of deprived boroughs Tower Hamlets, Newham, and Barking and Dagenham were up to twice as likely to die from lung diseases than those in richer areas such as Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster and Barnet.Though some of the differences between richer and poorer boroughs are likely to be due to factors such as smoking and generally lower health among the worse off, campaigners seized on the findings to make the link between respiratory problems and poor air quality.Andrea Lee, healthy air campaigner for pressure group , said: ※Air pollution is a public health crisis. The new mayor is rightly proposing bold policies to clean up the city＊s air. But the government needs to get its act together. Instead of , the government needs to show leadership in limiting harmful pollutants.§Figures recently revealed by the Guardian, which were in a report , showed that some of the capital＊s poorest schools were suffering levels of air pollution far higher than European legal limits.Khan, recently elected mayor of London,  in the light of the study. He said: ※This deeply concerning report shines a light on the huge health inequalities in London, as well as how poor air quality is a ticking timebomb for all our health, particularly for Londoners in the most deprived parts of the city.§Air pollution is an increasing concern, as  has shown the problem is growing and at least 40,000 people across the UK are dying prematurely because of it. The government is facing  over its failure to tackle the problem, some of which has resulted from the  on the road, and the repeated breaches of EU limits on pollutants.The mother of a nine-year-old girl from south London who died of asthma in 2013 is also  into whether air pollution was a factor, which if successful could lead to a new movement of legal action on behalf of victims. The girl, Ella Kissi-Debrah, lived in Hither Green near the capital＊s busy South Circular Road. Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: ※We know that air pollution can have a detrimental effect on the health of our most vulnerable citizens, and causes lasting damage. It＊s a worry for everyone, making existing lung problems worse, increasing our risk of lung cancer and early death.§Khan highlighted the BLF＊s finding that residents of deprived boroughs were up to twice as likely to die from lung diseases than those in rich ones. However, while some deaths are likely to be down to air pollution, the picture is complex.The link between air pollution and respiratory problems is proved, but the complication of people dying from lung diseases acquired from smoking, work and industry, and conditions they were born with means it is hard to draw a direct comparison with death rates from air pollution in rich and poor areas from this study.Some sites in central London boroughs, including the richest ones of Westminster, and Kensington and Chelsea, also suffer from very high pollution rates. For instance, Oxford Street in Westminster is .Simon Birkett, founder and director of , said: ※Central London boroughs have the highest death rates attributable to dangerous airborne particles and nitrogen dioxide, a toxic gas. It is fabulous therefore to see the mayor taking a lead but he will fail unless he bans diesel from the most polluted places before 2020.§Khan＊s plans include extending the capital＊s , which he may bring forward to before 2020, and extra charges on the most polluting vehicles within the congestion charge zone from 2017.The British Lung Foundation said it was not possible to tell from the report how many deaths were owing to air pollution, but that it painted a picture of the stark health inequalities among  boroughs, with the boroughs with highest levels of lung disease also among the most polluted. However, it said more research would need to be done to show this causal relationship.Woods said the report showed that lung disease, alongside cancer and cardiovascular disease, was one of the UK＊s biggest killers. But she said it had been systematically neglected, despite initiatives to help people stop smoking and other awareness measures. ※It is a common misconception that lung disease is just a smokers＊ condition,§ she said. §Many people affected have never smoked. Any effective strategy for tackling lung disease will need to address more than just tobacco.§"																																																			
"An independent review of the state of Australia＊s environment has found the impacts of climate change are increasing and some of the changes could be irreversible.The latest State of the Environment report, a scientific snapshot across nine areas released by the federal government every five years, says climate change is altering the structure and function of natural ecosystems in Australia, and is affecting heritage, economic activity and human wellbeing.It warns climate change will result in ※location specific vulnerabilities§ and says the most severe impacts will be felt by people who are socially and economically disadvantaged.Record high water temperatures caused ※widespread coral bleaching, habitat destruction and species mortality§ in the marine environment between 2011 and 2016, it says.The minister for energy and the environment, , was due to release the report card on Tuesday morning., Frydenberg says the report indicates the impact of changing weather patterns is being felt in the ocean, on the Great Barrier Reef and on land, affecting biodiversity and species habitat.※While carbon emissions per capita have declined from 24.1 tonnes in 2011 to 22.2 tonnes in 2015 and energy efficiency improvements are reducing electricity demand, the report makes clear that, for the world to meet its Paris goals, there is much more to do,§ Frydenberg says.The minister says the report makes clear Australia needs to prepare for changes in the environment and ※put in place a coordinated, comprehensive, well-resourced, long-term response§.He warns that failure to do so ※will have a direct and detrimental impact on our quality of life and leave a legacy to future generations that is inferior to the one we have inherited§.The minister says the report presents the government with a mixed picture. ※Good progress has been made in the management of the marine and Antarctic environments, natural and cultural heritage and the built environment 每 while pressures are building in relation to invasive species, climate change, land use and coastal protection,§ he says.Frydenberg says the doubling of Australia＊s population in the past 50 years and growing urbanisation ※have all combined to contribute to additional pressures on the environment§.Australia＊s heavily populated coastal areas are under pressure, as are ※growth areas within urban environments, where human pressure is greatest§, the report finds.Grazing and invasive species continue to pose a significant threat to biodiversity.※The main pressures facing the Australian environment today are the same as in 2011: climate change, land use change, habitat fragmentation and degradation, and invasive species,§ the report＊s summary says. ※In addition, the interactions between these and other pressures are resulting in cumulative impacts, amplifying the threats faced by the Australian environment.※Evidence shows that some individual pressures on the environment have decreased since 2011, such as those associated with air quality, poor agricultural practices, commercial fishing, and oil and gas exploration and production in Australia＊s marine environment.※During the same time, however, other pressures have increased 〞 for example, those associated with coal mining and the coal-seam gas industry, habitat fragmentation and degradation, invasive species, litter in our coastal and marine environments, and greater traffic volumes in our capital cities.§The report criticises the lack of ※an overarching national policy that establishes a clear vision for the protection and sustainable management of Australia＊s environment to the year 2050§.It points to poor collaboration, gaps in knowledge, data and monitoring and a lack of follow-though from policy to action.※Providing for a sustainable environment both now and in the future is a national issue requiring leadership and action across all levels of government, business and the community,§ it says. ※The first step is recognising the importance and value of ecosystem services to our economy and society.※Addressing Australia＊s long-term, systemic environmental challenges requires, among other things, the development of a suite of stronger, more comprehensive and cohesive policies focused on protecting and maintaining natural capital, and ongoing improvements to current management arrangements.§Late last year, the government established  climate policy.

"All over Britain, buses are slowing down. They＊re doing it in Brighton, Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol and Hull and most of all they＊re doing it in London. Over the past year, speeds on a third of London＊s bus routes have fallen by more than 5%, reducing some of them to walking speed: route 11, which , averages just 4 mph in parts. As a result, people are giving up on using buses. For ten years after the formation of Transport for London (TfL), the capital＊s bus service was a huge success. Only three years ago, demand for bus services was . Now, London is experiencing one of the fastest declines in bus use in the land. The implications for the city are profound. The problem is an increase in road traffic congestion, which has seen journey times for road traffic increase in Central London by 12% a year since 2012, . Congestion is a menace to air quality, a drag on business efficiency and a growing nuisance to Londoners of every kind as they try to get around the city. It has hit the bus service especially hard.The startling facts and consequences of the London bus slowdown have been set out in a  for the , a bus industry-backed body , among others, Transport for London (TfL) and the , which seeks to persuade car-users to switch to buses and coaches. The report has been compiled by Professor David Begg, a , former chair of the government＊s (now defunct) , ex-member of the TfL board, and currently proprietor of .Begg sets his findings in the context of TfL＊s finances and new London mayor Sadiq Khan＊s pledge to freeze public transport fares for four years. Pointing out that the government is to phase out the capital＊s public transport revenue subsidy from the 2018/19 financial year - making it the only major city in the world expected to do without one except Hong Kong - at the same time as Khan＊s freeze is introduced, he says that part of the solution to making TfL＊s ends meet ※is to operate buses more efficiently by improving their speed§.He calculates that if bus speeds could be increased by 24% it would enable TfL to make up for the loss a ?461m annual bus subsidy. That is because if buses are able to cover their routes more swiftly, reducing the time it takes them to get between stops, fewer of them are likely to be needed on each route. This would reduce the cost of running the routes without leaving passengers waiting longer at bus stops. A more efficient, reliable bus service would also be a more popular one, meaning that income from fares would go up. At the moment, everything is heading the wrong way. As former TfL commissioner Sir Peter Hendy writes in his foreword to Begg＊s report, worsening congestion in London is increasing costs and decreasing revenue when the exact reverse is needed.Some of the more recent causes of congestion might lessen before too long, as the roadworks required for Crossrail and cycle superhighways are completed, but the growth in the number of delivery vans and private hire vehicles together with the loss of road space to cycling have worked against the good effects of the congestion charge, introduced in 2003. This enabled the bus service to thrive, both by opening up more space for it and helping to pay for it. Boris Johnson, who came to power in 2008 promising to ※smooth traffic flow§, made matters worse thanks to his piecemeal policy appeasement of influential voter and lobby groups when he should have been implementing a coherent road space management strategy in a city in increasing need of it as its population rapidly grows. As Begg observes (): Dealing with this legacy will be a challenge for Mayor Khan, a former transport minister and a London bus-driver＊s son, and his incoming transport deputy Val Shawcross, who as a London Assembly member was a strong champion of the bus service. Khan＊s manifesto recognised that congestion is a continuing problem. But he has pledged to continue the cycle superhighways programme, including by investing in new routes. And although he＊s promised to try to co-ordinate roadworks better and reduce the number of heavy vehicles using London＊s roads, he has not pledged to expand congestion charging and has promised to maintain the charge at its present level. Enlarging the forthcoming  and bringing it in a year sooner than Johnson＊s target date of 2020 - moves Khan is  - might help to mitigate congestion, as the daily charge it will raise on polluting vehicles should deter owners of some of them from taking to the roads. But how far this might help the bus service and its passengers remains to be seen.It doesn＊t help that, despite being by far the most heavily used of London＊s public transport services, the bus service is too often ignored. Begg sums the problem up: Will the bus driver＊s son give London＊s bus service and those who use it the attention and the backing they deserve? "																																																			
"HE CAIRNGORMS: It didn＊t seem at all strange to discover a bedraggled reindeer sheltering from the storm just inside the entrance to the chair-lift the other day, for the wind was like a knife and the ski-runs like tilted ice-rinks. Of course, he might have merely come in for the company 每 you could see his fellows higher up the snowbound hillside 每 or he might have been hoping for a chance of something more succulent than the frozen heather roots these creatures seem to live on. But he wasn＊t very friendly, responding to a cautious stroking by an angry swing of the head, so I left him standing disconsolate near the ticket office and looking as if he＊d lost both Father Christmas and his sledge. I suppose they＊re harmless enough although a notice farther down the mountain warns ※Beware of Reindeer,§ but doesn＊t explain why. These were the only wild life we saw in the hills during a wild week, except for the ptarmigan in their white winter plumage hurrying through the snow, and once a handsome pheasant strutting across the track through the Rothiemurchus pines. Indeed, there were days, so fierce the winds, when these popular slopes were even deserted by the humans who normally at this time of year swarm like ants, and one day, especially, when I seemed quite alone in the mountains. Ski-ing that day was out of the question 每 you needed ice-axe and crampons just to get across the runs 每 and the wind so strong on the plateau it took you all your time to avoid being blown over the edge. But down by Loch Morlich in the late afternoon the wind suddenly dropped for half an hour, and there was the quiet splendour of purpling hills and a foreground of silvered loch with the birches and pines showing black against a golden sunset like a Chinese painting."																																																			
"Environmental campaigners in India have called for the government to implement a ※stringent, time-bound§ plan to curb air pollution in cities, as a new World Health Organisation report suggests that six of the 10 most polluted cities in the world are in .The report, which contains data from 795 cities in 67 countries between 2008 and 2013, shows Indian cities have some of the highest concentrations of particulate pollution, which can cause fatal damage to the heart and lungs. According to the WHO, air pollution is currently the greatest environmental risk to public health and causes about 3 million premature deaths globally every year. Six Indian cities 每 Gwalior, Allahabad, Patna, Raipur, Ludhiana, and Delhi 每 rank among the most polluted cities in the world. The report suggests millions of people in India are at risk of serious cardiac and respiratory infections and diseases because of high pollution levels. Indian environmental activists condemned Narendra Modi＊s government for inaction over pollution. Sunil Dahiya, a campaigner from Greenpeace India, said air pollution levels had spiked in recent years. ※The government has to give up the fossil fuel-based energy and look for cleaner forms of energy, such as renewables,§ he said. ※Pollution levels have increased since , and the government must take it seriously. Right now, no one is really accountable for air pollution in the government. ※They need to make a systematic, comprehensive, and time-bound plan on a national and regional level.§Anumita Roychowdhury of the Centre of Science and Environment, based in New Delhi, also believes environmental policy needs a thorough overhaul. ※So far in India the air pollution action has been confined to driving,§ she said, referring to a driving scheme implemented in Delhi that aims to reduce road traffic by alternating days on which vehicles with odd and even number plates could be on the roads. However, she argued that the report＊s findings looked only at particulate pollution and neglected to mention ozone and nitrogen oxide pollution, indicators that would implicate richer countries. ※It is not a holistic picture of pollution trends,§ she said.Modi, the prime minister, has made some commitments to protecting the environment, such as announcing a  at the Paris climate summit and . However the pro-business, development-focused government＊s commitment to green causes has been questioned.  and have had their funds frozen; corporations have been given land and resources cheaply and, earlier this year, l, which was heavily criticised for causing damage to the Yamuna river＊s floodplains.Subhas Datta, an environmental activist, said Modi＊s government was not alone and that successive Indian governments had failed to deliver on air pollution standards. ※Our political leaders don＊t know about the environment or realise the impact. They have a callous attitude to it,§ he said. ※Development should not have to mean destruction. It should be done in a sustainable way. Environmental activists have failed too, to bring this issue to light, and that＊s why we＊re facing this now. I have failed.§The Guardian contacted India＊s environment ministry for a response to the latest report, but a press officer said he was unable to comment.

"ne should not need to be a scientist to know that human population growth and the accompanying increase in human consumption are the root cause of the  we＊re currently seeing. All you need to know is that every living being has evolved to have a set of habitat requirements.An organism can＊t live where the temperature is too hot or too cold. If it lives in water, it requires not only an appropriate temperature range, but also appropriate salinity, acidity and other chemical characteristics. If it is a butterfly, it must have access to plants suitable for its caterpillars to eat. A lion requires plant-eaters to catch and devour. A tree needs a certain amount of sunlight and access to soil nutrients and water. A falciparum malaria parasite can＊t survive and reproduce without Anopheles mosquitos in its habitat and a human bloodstream to infest.The human population has grown so large that roughly  is now farmed to feed people 每 and none too well at that. Largely due to persistent problems with distribution,  go to bed hungry, and between one and two billion suffer from malnutrition. As a consequence of its booming population, Homo sapiens has taken much of the most fertile land to grow plants for its own consumption. But guess what? That cropland is generally not rich in food plants suitable for the caterpillars of the 15,000 butterfly species with which we share the planet. Few butterflies require the wheat, corn or rice on which humans largely depend. From the viewpoint of most of the Earth＊s wildlife, farming can be viewed as ※habitat destruction§. And, unsurprisingly, few species of wildlife have evolved to live on highways, or in strip malls, office buildings, kitchens or sewers 每 unless you count Norway rats, house mice, European starlings and German roaches. Virtually everything humanity constructs provides an example of habitat destruction.The more people there are, the more products of nature they demand to meet their needs and wants: timber, seafood, meat, gas, oil, metal ores, rare earths and rare animals to eat or to use for medicinal purposes. Human demands cause both habitat destruction and outright extermination of wildlife. So when you watch the expansion of the human enterprise; when you see buildings springing up; when you settle down to dinner at home or in a restaurant; you are observing (and often participating in) the sixth mass extinction.The expanding human population not only outright destroys habitats, it also alters them to the detriment of wildlife (and often people themselves). The more people there are, the more  flow into the atmosphere, and the greater the impacts on wildlife that require specific temperature ranges.And the more people there are, the more cities, roads, farm fields, fences and other barriers preventing wildlife from moving to areas of more favourable temperature or humidity in a rapidly changing climate. Less recognised, but perhaps even more dangerous to both people and wildlife, is the increasing toxification of the entire planet with synthetic chemicals. Growing populations want myriad  that often leak toxic chemicals: more cosmetics, cleansing compounds, pesticides, herbicides, preservatives and industrial chemicals. Many of these novel chemicals mimic natural hormones, and in tiny quantities can alter the development of animals or human children, with potentially catastrophic consequences. As with climate disruption, this is one more case of human overpopulation threatening civilisation.So we don＊t really need the evidence meticulously gathered and analysed by the scientific community showing the unusual and accelerating extermination of wildlife populations 每 and ultimately, species 每 to know that human population growth is a major and growing driver of the sixth mass extinction, just as it is with the related accelerating climate disruption. It will take a long time to humanely stop that growth and start the gradual shrinkage of the human population that is required if civilisation is to persist. All the more reason we should have started a half century ago, when the problem first came to public attention."																																																			
"Police are investigating allegations that protected wildlife was  owned by the Duke and Duchess of Rutland.Footage filmed by an animal rights group allegedly showed badgers caught in snares and shot this year.The Hunt Investigation Team (HIT) , which filmed the footage, said it was part of ※horrific wildlife persecution§ on the Moscar estate, a grouse shooting estate in the Peak District.It is a criminal offence to injure, kill or ill-treat badgers under the  in England and Wales.The Moscar estate, near Bamford in Derbyshire, is owned by the 11th Duke of Rutland, David Manners, and Emma Manners, the Duchess of Rutland. The pair, worth a reported ?140m, also own the 6,000-hectare (15,000-acre) Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire, a stronghold established at the Norman conquest that has appeared in films including The Da Vinci Code and The Young Victoria.A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of Rutland said in a statement: ※They were not aware of any alleged illegal activities being carried out on the land. They are horrified by these allegations and will investigate them fully.§HIT said an estimated 400 wire snares were set across the estate alongside a variety of traps to catch mammals and birds. The group said two badgers, one mountain hare, one fox and three lambs were found caught in the traps, which are legal in the UK, on one snare site over a four-week period in spring.The activists alleged that one badger was shot and dragged off to be buried in a nearby wood. A second badger was allegedly caught overnight and endured ※a prolonged capture and botched release§.HIT said investigators were able to release the three lambs unharmed, while a female mountain hare allegedly died from internal bleeding and stress after being caught in a snare.A fox struggled frantically to free itself before being shot three times when the gamekeeper arrived, HIT said.Under the Countryside Act 1981, snares must be inspected every day and any snared foxes killed quickly and humanely by a shot at close range from a rifle. They must also only be set in places likely to be used by a fox or rabbit.Tanya Hall, a HIT campaigner, said: ※The cruel decimation of wildlife is perpetrated daily in one of the most popular tourist areas of the UK. ※The immense suffering of badgers, foxes and hares that our investigators found is inflicted simply so that the Duke of Rutland＊s estate has plenty of grouse available to shoot. We must end this cycle of violence and cruelty and we encourage the public to add their support to our campaign.§A Derbyshire police spokesman said: ※Members of the group contacted one of our specialist wildlife officers last week and we now have a copy of the footage.※As a result, we have started an investigation and will be examining the clips as part of that.§It is not the first time the estate has faced scrutiny from animal rights groups. In 2015, the League Against Cruel Sports found 100 snares on the land after .Later that year, the Belvoir Hunt was mired in controversy when a  in an outbuilding hours before the annual gathering in Buckminster, Leicestershire.In March last year, two men were arrested on suspicion of assault after two anti-hunting campaigners were attacked while monitoring the Belvoir Hunt in March.

"Donald Trump was left isolated at the end of a fractious G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, after every other world leader signed up to a declaration that the  was irreversible following an unprecedented standoff.After the publication of a final communique that saw the emergence of a G19 grouping for the first time,  said she was ※dismayed at the US decision to pull out§ of the accord and had personally urged the president to reconsider.Asked why she had failed to raise the issue during a formal 50-minute bilateral meeting with Trump at the Hamburg Messehallen, as furious negotiations were still going on behind the scenes, the prime minister said: ※I did bring the issue of climate change agreement up with President Trump.※I have had a number of conversations with him while I＊ve been here at the . What I did was encourage him to bring the United States back into the Paris agreement, and I continue to hope that＊s what the United States will do.§It came after the president promised May that the US was ready to strike a trade deal with the UK as soon as possible after . ※There is no country that could possibly be closer than our countries,§ Trump said. ※We have been working on a trade deal which will be a very, very big deal 每 a very powerful deal, great for both countries 每 and I think we will have that done very, very quickly.§He added: ※Prime Minister May and I have developed a very special relationship and I think trade will be a very big factor between our two countries.§It came as May used the two-day summit to focus on the possibility of post-Brexit trade opportunities in a series of one-on-one meetings with non EU leaders, including China＊s Xi Jinping, India＊s Narendra Modi, and Japan＊s Shinzo Abe.※I have held a number of meetings with other world leaders at this summit and have been struck by their strong desire to forge ambitious new trading relationships with the UK after Brexit,§ said May. ※This is a powerful vote of confidence in British goods, British services, Britain＊s economy and the British people 每 and we look forward to building on these conversations in the months ahead.§May said she would not be sceptical about the Trump offer but remained ※optimistic§.However, critics were quick to warn against taking Trump at his word. ※I think it is political puffery. There will be no fast US-UK trade agreement,§ said a former senior official at the IMF and in the Canadian government, who has dealt with the US in a major trade negotiation.Thomas Bernes, now a fellow at the , said: ※I was involved in the Canada-US trade agreement and it was extremely complicated. No one will be interested in a trade deal until you know where the UK is vis-a-vis the European Union and until that point is reached you can have plenty of goodwill but it is nothing more than that.§He claimed that Trump had failed to understand the complexity of trade agreements, saying the US president would first need to request permission to negotiate from Congress, which would have six months to consider the issue.The G20 meeting saw a number of tense encounters between Trump and other world leaders, with a particular clash between him and the French delegation over climate change, but also tensions over protectionism and the overproduction of steel.The final communique said: ※We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris agreement.§ It added: ※The leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris agreement is irreversible.§However, the US did succeed in forcing in a controversial reference to helping countries access fossil fuels in a clean way 每 to the fury of environmental campaigners.Steve Price-Thomas, Oxfam＊s director of advocacy and campaigns, said: ※With the other 19 members firmly defending the Paris agreement as irreversible, President Trump＊s stubborn insistence on propping up the fossil fuel industry leaves him isolated and stuck in the past.§ He also accused the G20 of treating the world＊s poorest as an afterthought.The communique placed a new emphasis on the need for trade deals to be reciprocal and non-discriminatory, reducing the previous emphasis on the primacy of liberalisation. At the same time it called for adherence to a rules-based regime and respect for the WTO. It also called for ※concrete policy solutions§ on excess steel capacity to be prepared by November this year; a speed-up in the previous timetable and a concession to Trump.On trade, another sticking point during the two-day summit, the leaders agreed they would ※fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognise the role of legitimate trade defence instruments in this regard.§"																																																			
																																																			
"As we hike through the cool, low-canopied forest along a levada 每 a centuries-old water canal carved out of the mountainside 每 our guide talks effusively of a pigeon. It＊s the ※guardian of the forest§ the guide with MB Tours tells me and the other hikers. Known as the Trocaz pigeon, or alternatively the laurel pigeon or the long-toed pigeon, it＊s only found here: on the Portuguese island of Madeira. We halt under an ancient laurel tree and the guide explains that the endemic pigeon is vital to Madeira because it disperses many of the plants found in this unique forest ecosystem: the laurisilva. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the laurisilva 每 a name that sounds like it was invented by Tolkien 每 is a relic ecosystem found only in a few places on our planet: the Azores, the Canary Islands, and the largest remnant here in Madeira. Made up largely of laurel trees, it＊s an ecosystem that once covered much of southern , some 15-40 million years ago. And it＊s home to many species found no-where, including the Trocaz pigeon with its unmistakably silver strips crisscrossing the nape of its neck. ※[The Trocaz pigeon] play[s] a determinant role for [the laurisilva＊s] balance and expansion,§ Catia Gouveia, with the Portuguese Society for the Study of  (SPEA) in Madeira, writes to me later.And yet since 2012 the pigeon has been routinely culled on the island by the Forestry Police due to its propensity to raid agricultural fields, especially cabbage plantations and fruit orchards, important crops to the small island.  On its website, the government claims the pigeon has ※disastrous socio-economic consequences for farmers and, consequently, for the family economy.§This guardian of the forest is seen by many in Madeira as a pest, despite being a species found nowhere else and playing a vital role in keeping the laurisilva vibrant. Madeira in Portuguese means ＆wood.＊ When the Portuguese first settled in the 1420s they found an island blanketed in lush forest, specifically, the laurisilva. There were no natives living on Madeira 每 allowing the Portuguese to settle it without enslaving or exploiting indigenous people as they did in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique and East Timor. Not only was Madeira free of people, but, like a mini-New Zealand, the island also held zero land mammals 每 no rats, mice, cats, monkeys, dogs, or rabbits 每 just a few bats (the Azores was the same). Lying over 500 kilometers from the African coast, Madeira 每 about half the size of Hertfordshire 每 was simply too far over rough seas for land animals to make the crossing, even haphazardly. The total absence of land mammals allowed the Trocaz pigeon to become the royalty of Madeira. Believed to be descended from common wood pigeons, the Trocaz pigeon found a niche on the island with few predators, no humans and little direct competition. When people arrived, of course, things changed. Most of the forests were chopped down, some replaced with villages and towns, others with crops like cabbage, fruit and vineyards, others with exotic forests like eucalyptus. Today, only about 20 percent of the island remains covered in the laurisilva.In the 1980s the Trocaz pigeon almost went extinct as hunting pushed the population to less than 3,000 animals. Only when hunting was outlawed and the pigeon was added to the Europe-wide Birds Directive in 1986 did the species began to recover. Today its population has reached about 10,000-14,000 individuals. The story was a conservation success 每 and then some flocks started feasting on crops. When it comes to food, the Trocaz pigeon is an unfussy opportunist. Research has shown that they eat at least 33 plants from the laurel forests. But pigeon colonies living near agricultural areas have also taken a liking to locals＊ fruit trees and crops, especially cabbage. When a farmer reports they have problem pigeons, the government urges them to purchase various tools to force the birds away including petrol-fueled ＆bird scares＊ that cause loud noises periodically, nets to keep the birds out of certain areas, and holographic tape that scares them off. But where such measure haven＊t succeeded, a spokesperson from the government＊s Institute of Forests and Nature  said the government was allowed to perform a ※correction of the population§ by the Forestry Police.In others words, government officials come in and shoot the cabbage-devouring pigeons. The government did not respond to several queries asking how many pigeons have been shot. Gouveia with SEPA said that culling birds protected under the EU Birds Directive should only be allowed in ※exceptional cases.§ She added that SEPA has not seen ※sufficiently detailed studies to date§ on what crops are being eaten and ※above all§ how much farmers are actually losing in economic terms. ※This information is important in order to take decisions on other possible measures, including compensation to farmers,§ Gouveia said. She said she does not believe that the government has ※exhausted§ all alternatives before turning to shooting. Nor does SEPA have information on how many farmers have actually tried all the other options before they turn to the government to deal with the problem pigeons. While the Trocaz pigeon is currently listed as least concern that doesn＊t mean it is at zero risk of extinction. Already, humans have eradicated a population that once lived on the neighboring island of Porto Santo. Now, it is a bird surviving on a single island with a population that, while stable, isn＊t especially large. There are more people living in the village of Louth than all the Trocaz pigeons in Madeira 每 and therefore the world.An epidemic could hypothetically wipe out such a population quickly. For example, disease is believed to have killed off two native rodents on Christmas Island within a decade of the arrival of black rats and their contagions. The best safeguard against a similar fate is a robust, genetically diverse population. Still, there is no question that the species is a nuisance to many 每 and arguably an economic problem on Madeira. It is a conflict species: farmers have been known to illegally shoot and poison the pigeons. But Manuel J. Nogales Hidalgo, a reseacher with the Spanish National Research Council, said the government＊s decision to cull the pigeons was ※difficult to understand§ given that usually endemic island species are suffering from far too few individuals 每 rarely too many. In some ways, the plight of the Trocaz pigeon is a microcosm for our global wildlife crisis. Around the world, wildlife populations have plunged by approximately 58 percent in just the last forty years, according to WWF and the Zoological Society of London, which are tracking 3,700 vertebrate species worldwide. As the human population has grown 每 seven billion plus 每 the world＊s other life-forms have less and less habitat in which to make their homes and fewer resources to keep them alive. And whenever any of these non-human species 每 whether it is wolves, bears, elephants, rabbits, lions, spiders, snakes, leopards, deer, crows, coyotes, or Trocaz pigeons 每 dare to bother us in our space it rarely ends well for them. Sure, we＊re fine with wild species 每 but only so long as they stay where they belong: in national parks and other protected areas (about 14 percent of land and 3 percent of the oceans). The human species is evolutionary covetous for the most part, unwilling to share, unwilling to live and let live, unwilling to sacrifice even just a little for another species＊ well-being. Our lawns are manicured into grassy deserts, our lakes stocked with the fish we want to catch, our oceans blanketed by nets and lines, even our national parks are invaded by oil, gas, mining, and logging industries. It＊s difficult enough for humans to share with other humans 每 let alone other animals. Still, as the Earth undergoes a potential , it remains to be seen whether we humans are capable of viewing the natural world a little differently. Are we able to see our earth as something no longer limitless and no longer abundant, as something that is being displaced and wrung out? Something that＊s maybe even worth sacrificing a little for? We don＊t see any Trocaz pigeons on my hike through the laurisilva. But one afternoon I find them with my binoculars cooing on the sea cliffs. Large and heavy-set, the flashing stripes on their neck gives them an unexpected beauty. And I realize: this is the only place on our planet where one can do this - watch the light glint off a Trocaz pigeon＊s silver feathers. Chilling out in the noon sun, the birds look as inoffensive as any life form could be 每 but then again they aren＊t eating my garden. As I watch the pairs, I find myself trying to solve the puzzle: how do we keep the people happy and the pigeons alive? Should farmers be asked to give up on some of their crops? Should pigeons be moved out of agricultural areas? Should we just keep shooting? My mind wanders: why not stop the culling? But will farmers simply retaliate with illegal shooting and poisoning? Why not sell wildlife-friendly cabbage at a premium? Maybe the Maderian hipsters will love it 每 but most would still buy the cheap stuff. Or why not pay farmers for every lost cabbage? Why not ask tourists to donate to the ＆save the pigeons＊ fund? Hey, we could rewild the island of Porto Santo with Trocaz pigeons 每 then we＊d have an insurance population! I soon realise I don＊t have an easy answer. But that＊s the luxury of being a journalist: I don＊t need one. I just need to tell the story and hope someone cleverer figures it out.

"World leaders have made clear the US＊s isolated stance on climate change, with 19 of the G20 countries affirming their commitment to the ※irreversible§ .After lengthy negotiations that stretched well into Saturday, the final joint statement from the meeting in Hamburg notes Donald Trump＊s withdrawal from the Paris deal while stating that the world＊s other major economies all still support the international effort to slow dangerous global warming. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Saturday she ※deplored§ the US exit from the agreement and added that she did not share the view of Theresa May, the British prime minister, that Washington could decide to rejoin the pact.※I think it＊s very clear that we could not reach consensus, but the differences were not papered over, they were clearly stated,§ Merkel told reporters at the end of the two-day meeting. ※It＊s absolutely clear it is not a common position.§The : ※We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris agreement,§ adding: ※The leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris agreement is irreversible§ and ※we reaffirm our strong commitment to the Paris agreement§.The US did successfully manage to insert text referencing fossil fuels which read: ※The United States of America states it will endeavour to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.§World leaders meeting in Hamburg managed to agree almost every aspect of the statement, including the potentially contentious issue of trade, but the final text was held up by the US＊s contrarian approach to climate change.In June, Trump, who has enthusiastically touted coal and oil extraction,  from the Paris agreement, which aims to avoid dangerous global warming of more than 2C (3.6F) compared to the pre-industrial period.The strongest proponents of the climate deal, including Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have attempted to shore up support for the Paris deal among countries following Trump＊s decision to exit the agreement. Saudi Arabia and Indonesia were reportedly considering watering down their commitment to the deal but they ended up reiterating their support at the  summit.The final communique was accompanied by an agreed climate and energy  that supports the key planks of the Paris agreement and sets goals to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and shift countries towards ※affordable, reliable, sustainable and low greenhouse gas emission energy systems as soon as feasible§.A lengthy notice period means that the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement will not take place until November 2020. The US will become the only country in the world not signed up to the landmark 2015 deal other than Nicaragua, which complained that it wasn＊t strong enough, and Syria, currently mired in a bloody civil war.Trump＊s administration has sought to unravel domestic climate policies by , which would slash emissions from coal-fired power plants, halting new  and opening up new areas of  and oceans to mining and drilling. has been one of the animating causes for protesters who have clashed with police in Hamburg, resulting in more than 100 arrests. On Friday, Greenpeace erected a giant effigy of Trump, dressed in a diaper and soiling himself with oil on the globe, on the river Elbe.Other environmental groups were more optimistic, noting that almost all of the world＊s major powers were broadly behind the transition to low-carbon energy and ameliorating the impacts of climate change.※In the end, it was a landslide victory for countries voicing support for global climate action,§ said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute. ※Chancellor Merkel demonstrated deft leadership in rallying 19 of the world＊s largest economies to deliver an unmistakable message behind climate action.※The direction of travel toward clean energy is loud and clear. The question remains how quickly the world will surge forward and how far behind the  will let the United States fall.§Mohamed Adow, international climate lead at Christian Aid, said: ※The US president＊s weak attempts to capsize the climate movement have failed: he is now marooned on a political island of his own making, with his head buried in the sand. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is moving ahead.§"																																																			
"hortly before World Ocean Day, and a special UN meeting to address threats facing oceans, the US president, Donald Trump, . Here in Australia, there was a welcome bipartisan commitment to stay the course, with  in this critically important environmental pact.But Australia＊s environmental diplomacy needs to be more than just defensive. Taking a cue from French president Emmanuel Macron＊s pledge to  by determined leadership on climate action, Australia should likewise move on to the front foot. And one place where it can make a big contribution is in its own backyard 每 Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. The Antarctic and its surrounding seas are experiencing profound physical and ecological pressure as a result of climate change and ocean acidification. Just last week, scientists reported on a big melting event on the surface of the Ross ice shelf during 2016, across an area of about 800,000 sq km, which is larger than Texas. Antarctica＊s ice shelves are also melting from below and are beginning to fracture and disintegrate. The Larsen C ice shelf, a major extension of the West Antarctic ice sheet, is the latest to show , with a big rift rapidly ※unzipping§ a large portion of the shelf from the ice front. The calving of the shelf is only a matter of time.The states that manage Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have powerful tools at their fingertips to give ecosystems the best possible chance of adapting to the physical changes under way in , while governments globally come to grips with the climate crisis.These tools include Marine Protected Areas, in which fishing is banned or limited to protect ecosystems and species. The science is clear that marine reserves can mitigate climate change and help ecosystems adapt to changes in water temperature, chemistry and circulation. MPAs help build ecosystem resilience, provide refuge for marine species and can also protect carbon pools, or sinks (※blue carbon§).In 2016, a deadlock of more than five years was broken when the Ross Sea MPA, the largest marine reserve in the world, was established by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. CCAMLR is the international body established under the Antarctic treaty system with the specific mandate of protecting the Southern Ocean ecosystem.Australia rightly enjoys a reputation as a global leader in the protection of the Antarctic environment. But our country needs to step up its diplomacy, particularly if it wishes to achieve the designation of the east Antarctic representative system of marine protected areas, a joint initiative of Australia, France and the EU.The proposal was developed in 2010 on the basis of extensive scientific research. But since then, it has not gained consensus support within CCAMLR. Successive revisions have been made to the proposal to make it more acceptable to the CCAMLR parties.The east Antarctic MPA is already smaller than initially proposed, comprising three areas instead of seven. Also still up for discussion is how strong the protections will be within the MPA. There is a risk that the proponents will water down the proposal and accept a compromise in the face of potential Chinese and Russian opposition. The east Antarctic MPA is therefore still in flux 每 France and the EU have drafted a revised proposal that has been shared with the Australian government. The ball is now in Australia＊s court on how best to proceed.The experience with the Ross Sea MPA shows that high-level political engagement is vital to make breakthroughs in Antarctic protection. The Ross Sea MPA was achieved in large part because of the direct interventions of the then US secretary of state John Kerry and president Barack Obama to persuade Russia and China to support the proposal.If the east Antarctic MPA is to be much more than just a ※paper park§ 每 an MPA in name only 每 it is vital that the Australian government identify it as a top diplomatic priority. Strong protections need to be retained in the MPA, including strict no-take areas where fishing is prohibited, which will protect the coastal and ocean ecosystems, including foraging areas for Ad谷lie and emperor penguins.There is limited time for bilateral negotiations before the next CCAMLR meeting in Hobart in October, and the success of the MPA will hinge on whether Australia can join France and the EU in advocating for areas that will be firmly off limits for the commercial fishing industry. If Australia is successful, it would mark a big achievement in Southern Ocean protection. But success is far from assured, and without a strong diplomatic effort at the highest levels, we could be saddled with a second-best outcome and one that would fail to serve the interests of effective Antarctic protection in an era of rapid environmental change.

"ach morning just after dawn, if you stop at the top of the hill that separates the town of Singleton from the tiny village of Camberwell in , says Wendy Bowman, ※you＊ll see this brown scud across the sky§.※It doesn＊t go over the ridges; it stays in the valley, going up and down all the time.§ She mimes a slow sieving motion: up, down.The dirty halo of pollution hovers above the open-cut coalmines that surround her 190-hectare property in the Hunter Valley, 200km north of Sydney. Bowman has lived in the farming region for most of her 83 years and is one of Camberwell＊s last remaining residents.In the past 30-odd years she has seen communities divided, then conquered, by coalmining. Surrounded by mines on three sides, Bowman＊s farm 每 surrounding her picturesque cottage, Rosedale 每 is a bastion of resistance.In 2010 the Chinese-owned company Yancoal proposed extending the Ashton South East open-cut mine: an $83m project to extract 16.5m tonnes of coal over seven years. An initial objection on grounds of air and water pollution was overturned on appeal in 2012 and the expansion was given the go-ahead by the New South Wales state government＊s planning assessment commission. More than half the coal that would be extracted was under Bowman＊s property.That proved to be quite the barrier. She refused ※significant§ offers, reportedly in the region of seven figures, to sell it to Yancoal.※Their solicitor rang me and said, ＆I think I＊ll come over and we＊ll discuss the purchase price,＊§ she remembers. ※I said, ＆I wouldn＊t bother if I were you.＊ He said, ＆Why?＊ I said, ＆I＊m not selling to you, so don＊t contact me again.＊※I haven＊t heard from them since.§Yancoal＊s silence was not to be taken for acceptance and the company launched a protracted legal battle to get the expansion over the line. In November 2015 the state court of appeal upheld an earlier decision that the mine could proceed only on condition that Bowman sold Yancoal her land.It was the first time an Australian court had placed such a restriction on a mining company. By then the ※David and Goliath-style battle§ between Bowman and Yancoal, as it was reported, had been before the courts for nearly five years.※It was such a weird decision,§ she says. ※＆Yes, the mine could go ahead, but ＃ ＊ And the ＆but＊ was me.§This straightforward act of refusal put into practice Bowman＊s years of activism against mining in the Hunter Valley, for which she has been awarded a  for grassroots advocacy. The so-called ※green Nobel§ recognises six individuals each year 每 one from each of the world＊s geographic regions 每 with a one-off payment of US$175,000. Speaking before her departure for the US to accept the prize, Bowman says she still regards the award, offered in a phone call four months ago, with a mixture of bemusement, suspicion and fear. ※There was all this clapping in the background. I thought, ＆They＊re having me on.＊ ＃ It all became obvious what it was and, since then, it＊s frightened the death out of me. If you think of all the people in New South Wales, in Queensland, who are fighting for the environment 每 I mean, why me?§ Her principal objection to the proposed mine expansion was that it risked polluting Glennies creek, an important tributary of the Hunter river and a water source for most of the farms in the area.She experienced the devastating impact of this herself in the late 1980s. After her husband＊s sudden death in 1984, Bowman 每 widowed at 50 每 took over running their sizeable dairy farm, Ashton, alone. By then, mining companies had started making their mark on the land. The all-night noise and light, the pervasive blanket of dust 每 Bowman paints an apocalyptic picture of those first forays into coal. ※The blasts were just dreadful,§ she remembers.When a coalmine tunnelled under a nearby creek, it contaminated the water the farm relied on for irrigation, causing her lucerne crops to fail. For a 12-day stretch in the ※stinking hot summer§ of January 1991, she remembers, the water was unusable.That same year she founded the Minewatch NSW group to support landowners under pressure to sell. Farmers with financial difficulties or who were otherwise ※vulnerable§ would be made offers they couldn＊t refuse that came with gag orders.※This ＆divide and conquer＊, as we call it 每 dividing families, dividing communities 每 is not the right way to treat people ＃ There were husbands and wives broken apart, fathers and sons didn＊t speak.§It was the dust from construction of a new mine nearby that dealt the final blow to Bowman＊s Ashton property, contaminating the vats in which the milk was stored.She managed to convince Rix＊s Creek mine to buy it from her but remained in the historic homestead of Granbalang 每 her marital home since 1958 每 until 2005, when she was given six weeks＊ notice to leave.Bowman then settled in Rosedale, another family property vacated by a tenant, where she has remained stubbornly since.With the profitability of the Ashton mine expansion dependent on her land, Bowman was a key plaintiff in the public interest case against it in the NSW land and environment court.At the time, Justice Nicola Pain＊s ruling in December 2014 that the expansion could only go ahead if she agreed to sell caused Bowman real anxiety. ※I kept thinking, ＆Why would you do that?＊ It left me dangling in the air, left them dangling in the air.§Now she thinks of it as a strategic move: had Pain refused the expansion outright, Yancoal could have taken its case to the high court. (Pain and the land and environment court did not respond to requests for comment on this story.)※As it is, they can＊t do a thing,§ says Bowman. ※Afterwards, I thought it was probably a very clever thing to do but it did frighten me for a long while, because I didn＊t understand what she was getting at ＃ I just wish I was 50 years old and not what I am 每 that I＊d live a lot longer, and stay here.§In June 2013 Bowman received an Order of Australia medal in recognition of her fight to protect communities and farmland from mining.Energetic and steely with a keen, amused sense of the ridiculous, Bowman has three adult daughters and six grandchildren. Each wall of her kitchen bears a framed collage of snapshots from trips she has taken, some recently, to Madagascar, Mauritius, R谷union, Canada, Iceland and Greenland.But on a daily basis it＊s her property that sustains her, keeps her interested and active 每 and especially the animals that also call it home. She talks with evident pleasure and evocative detail about the lizard (※my friend Bluey§) that lives under the steps; the butcherbirds that visit her daily; the odd echidna that rolls into the garden; even the cockatoos that have ravaged her olive tree.The farm＊s operations have been scaled back significantly but she retains a herd of caramel-coloured Droughtmaster cattle that she looks after with a staff of two.Bowman＊s property is an expanse of green bordered by mines. ※We＊re surrounded,§ she says. Coalmining＊s mark on the environment is glaring; its impact on people＊s health is more insidious. The fine grey dust that blankets her property 每 ※that＊s what everybody＊s breathing,§ says Bowman, who says a CT scan showed she had lost 20% of her lung function.A local GP＊s independent study of Singleton school children aged eight years and over suggested one in six had limited lung capacity, compared with one in 20 nationwide.※If I＊m puffed going up a hill, it doesn＊t matter at my age, but what effect is it going to have on these little children? The government says when it＊s a very dusty day, mothers just should keep them inside the house and shut the doors and windows.※Should children have to live like that? ＃ No, it＊s all wrong.§Over the decades, Bowman＊s farms have been ravaged by floods, droughts, disease 每 all the spanners that nature can throw. Balancing the demands of the environment and agriculture is delicate enough without mining thrown into the mix.※Without water, there＊s no life,§ she says. ※The pollution that＊s happening is affecting humans and animals ＃ I don＊t believe this unbelievable greed for money in a hurry is worth completely just wrecking the land and the water for generations to come.§"																																																			
" is being accused of trying to water down the wording of a G20 draft communique about climate change, with US and EU officials expected to clash over the issue in talks expected to stretch through the night.One section of the draft, seen by the Guardian, took note of the US decision to  on climate change, but added: ※The United States affirms its strong commitment to a global approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs.§That sentence has since been removed and the US is trying to introduce a new phrase that has angered other countries, and also campaigners, because it refers to fossil fuels. It says: ※Given the importance of energy access and security in the nationally determined contributions of other countries, the United States of America will endeavour to work closely with other partners to help their access to and use of fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and help deploy renewable and other clean energy sources.§Sources said that diplomats from France, Italy and the EU more generally were working to block the addition, while Angela Merkel admitted that discussions on climate change and trade would be difficult. The German chancellor said they would stretch ※through the night§ but that was not unusual for such negotiations. Max Lawson, a senior policy adviser at Oxfam, said: ※Ending climate change is about ending harmful fossil fuels. The US is attempting to force language into the communique on planet-destroying, dirty energy.  is a myth. The remaining G19 should show some backbone and stand up to him.§Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, added: ※The G19 needs to stand together and make it very clear it will implement Paris and strengthen their climate action no matter what Trump says or does. They have a responsibility and an opportunity to move forward swiftly.§All world leaders gathering at the  Summit in Hamburg with the exception of the US plan to assert the irreversibility of their decision to commit to carbon reduction targets under the Paris accord.The news came as it emerged Trump was holding his high-profile bilateral meeting with , at the same time the G20 group will be having a formal session on climate change.Many leaders have expressed their disappointment at Trump＊s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, with Theresa May claiming on Friday morning that she hopes ※they will be able to find a way to come back into the Paris agreement§.Using , the UK prime minister added: ※I believe that is possible. We are not renegotiating the Paris agreement. That stays.§The joint communique notes, but does not condemn, the US decision to withdraw, instead claiming the US is committed to cutting carbon emissions by other routes. The communique also calls for the commitments made under the Paris treaty to be implemented swiftly.Angela Merkel, the German host, has said there are clear differences between the US and the rest of the G20 on climate change, adding that there is no point in disguising them. There have been suggestions that the Chinese did not want the disagreement to be highlighted in a communique that the US would feel it was impossible to sign. The Chinese vice-minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, said the aim should be consensus among all members.There were also fears that some of the less enthusiastic supporters of the Paris treaty might backtrack and join the US in pulling out. Russia and Turkey, for instance, have signed the agreement but not ratified it. Saudi Arabia, which was one of the last countries to hold out, has both signed and ratified.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, underlined the threat climate change poses to Africa and alluded to an expected increase in migration, saying ※when it comes to Africa I assume the Paris agreement will be supported by almost everyone§.The European council president, Donald Tusk, also praised Trump＊s surprising speech hailing the virtues of the transatlantic alliance, but questioned whether these words will be followed by deeds. He said ※I＊ve heard yesterday in Warsaw surprising diplomatic words from the American president about transatlantic community, about the cooperation between the United States, Europe, about our common political tradition and civilisation, and about the readiness to protect and to defend the whole western community.※We have been waiting for a long time to hear these words from President Trump but the real question is whether it was a one-time incident or a new policy. President Trump said yesterday in Warsaw that words are easy, but it is actions that matter 每 and the first test will be our meeting here in Hamburg.§The final version of the communique will be negotiated overnight by diplomats from the 20 attending countries.But Merkel is under domestic pressure not to brush the dispute on climate change under the carpet.Germany＊s federal environment minister Barbara Hendricks, a member of the SDP, had insisted the differences could not be covered up, saying ※we must not be stopped from protecting the climate. The climate treaty is not negotiable.§The German Green party chairman, Cem ?zdemir, said: ※We need to send a strong signal. The G20 countries produce 80% of global CO2 emissions, so they have a lever in their hands ＃ I expect the summit to make a clear commitment to the Paris climate change agreement.§Greenpeace director Morgan added: ※Merkel, as the G20 host, must not sacrifice ambition for unity. Instead, we need a G19 commitment to climate action that demonstrates the intent to implement and even go beyond what 195 nations agreed to in Paris.§"																																																			
																																																			
"Nearly 40 million people in the UK are living in areas where illegal levels of air pollution from diesel vehicles risk damaging their health, according to analysis commissioned by the  party.The extent of the air pollution crisis nationally is exposed in the data which shows 59% of the population are living in towns and cities where nitrogen dioxide (NO) pollution breaches the lawful level of 40 microgrammes per cubic metre of air.Labour says the air pollution crisis is a ※national scandal§. Sue Hayman, shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, said a Labour government would bring in a new clean air act to tackle what was a public health emergency.※Labour will not allow the Tories to use the snap general election or Brexit to kick this issue into the long grass or water down standards that would put millions of UK adults and children at risk,§ said Hayman.She said the party was committed to putting in place a network of clean air zones across the UK where there are high emissions, and would act at an international level to  in emissions testing of vehicles.The analysis published by Labour shows more than 38 million people, representing 59.3% of the UK population, are living in areas where levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution are above legal limits.Local authorities including Aberdeen, , Bournemouth, Burnley, Derby, Chelmsford, Leeds, Northampton, Richmond and Sheffield 每 among many others 每 have NO levels above the legal limit.The new figures were revealed as the government made a last-minute application to the high court to delay publication of a new tougher air quality plan to tackle the pollution crisis.On Friday at 7pm, ministers lodged the court application 每 too late for it to be considered. Judges had ordered them to come up with a tough new draft air quality plan by 4pm this coming Monday 每 24 April 每 after judges said the original measures were so poor as to be unlawful.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, criticised ministers for failing to produce a new air quality plan.※I am deeply disappointed that ministers have missed a golden opportunity to show real leadership and urgently introduce new plans to deal with our filthy air,§ he said.※This could have been done well before the pre-election period started had the government treated this as a priority as I do. Instead they have used the general and local elections as a smokescreen to hide their incompetence as they seek to extend the court-ordered deadline for publishing their draft plan.§James Thornton, the CEO of legal NGO ClientEarth, which successfully took the government to court over its air quality plans, said the Labour data showed air pollution was a national problem which required a national solution.※Our court case forced the government to come up with new plans to bring down illegal levels of air pollution across the country,§ said Thornton.※Those plans must include a national network of clean air zones to keep the dirtiest diesel vehicles out of pollution hotspots, if we are to stand any chance of dealing with this public health crisis.§ClientEarth condemned the government＊s application to the high court to delay the plans being published. Thornton said: ※This is not a political issue but a public health issue. Whichever party is in power, the British public need to see an air quality plan which relies on good scientific evidence and which ensures that people no longer have to breathe toxic air and suffer the grave consequences to their health as a result.§ClientEarth will be able to raise objections if the new draft plan - when it is eventually published after the election 每 does not fulfil the NGO＊s five clear lines in the sand.These are:The Guardian  that  in schools and nurseries across England and Wales are being exposed to illegal levels of damaging air pollution from diesel vehicles.The joint investigation with Greenpeace, which examined the government＊s most recent air pollution modelling, showed 2,091 schools, nurseries, further education centres and after-school clubs are within 150 metres of a road emitting illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide.European data  每 which are subject to a much stricter testing regime.Research consistently shows exposure to traffic fumes is harmful for children and adults.

"t is 9am and the temperature in  City is 45C and rising, but already people working outside. A row of litter-pickers are already hard at work along a coastal highway, their entire bodies covered to protect them from the sun. Outside one of the city＊s many malls, valets hover beside the air-conditioned entrance, while two men in white hats huddle wearily next to their ice cream stands.Other city residents are luckier. They can avoid the outdoors altogether, escaping the inferno by sheltering in malls, cars and office buildings, where temperatures are kept polar-cold. For years, Kuwait＊s climate has been steadily heating up. In the summer months, the Gulf state now frequently touches 50C, and was last year  of being the , when temperatures reached a staggering high of 54C. But while the capital is making plans to prepare for climate change and the rising heat, there are growing concerns for those residents who cannot afford to shelter inside, and mounting questions about how such an energy-intensive city can survive as resources such as water and oil dwindle. is made up of migrant workers, many of whom power the near-constant construction of new office complexes and malls across the state. Though labour legislation now bans work outdoors between 12pm and 4pm, many are seen toiling through the hottest hours of the day regardless.During a recent visit, the Guardian witnessed tens of labourers on a building site close to Kuwait international airport working well past the 12pm deadline in 47C heat. Climbing on scaffolding amid the skeleton frame of a future shopping mall, some tried to take shelter in the shade available, as others swigged from bottle of water to cool down. The irony: they were installing air conditioning.One company manager overseeing the site, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ※Here in Kuwait or in the Gulf, you can see that most of the labourers are not citizens. They come from Egypt, India or Bangladesh.§ Many of the toughest jobs on the site are subcontracted out, he explained, allowing companies to flout laws designed to shield workers from the heat.If the labourers decline to work in these conditions, ※they won＊t get any money and will be forced to return to their home countries§, he said. He added that he had never witnessed a government inspection targeting working conditions, and that official were only concerned with workers＊ residency visas.The conditions for those men and women forced to work outside are set to worsen: between 2010 and 2035, Kuwait＊s annual average temperature will increase by 1.6% to 28.7C , according to the country＊s Environmental Public Authority (EPA), making for increasingly sweltering summer temperatures and more of the dust storms that already plague Kuwait City and beyond.※Yes, we＊re under pressure,§ says Shareef al-Khayat, head of the climate change division at the EPA. ※Not just from rising temperatures, but sea level rises 每 the demand for electricity and water will also be harder in the future.§His colleague, Sameera al-Kandari, jokes: ※But we＊re prepared 每 we have air conditioning everywhere!§One of the problems at the heart of Kuwait City＊s struggle against the effects of climate change is the central role that oil has played 每 and continues to play 每 in the construction of the urban landscape: the discovery of the precious resource in 1938 not only created a deeply felt symbol of national pride, and massive wealth, but reshaped the design of modern Kuwait City from the ground up. The 1952 ※Kuwait masterplan§ drew ideas from British urban planners 每 such as ＊s  movement 每 to completely remodel the city, demolishing the previous close-knit mud-brick buildings adapted to the local climate that made up the Old City, and replacing them with more western notions of what an urban environment should look like. Kuwait City subsequently underwent a radical transformation, switching to a grid system where cars 每 powered by cheap petrol 每 were required to navigate the maze of highways for almost all everyday tasks. ※The planners who came [in the mid-20th century] planned according to the highways and then started filling in the blanks,§ explains Dr Nasser B Abulhasan, head of , a firm trying to spur sustainable building in Kuwait. ※Unfortunately in this region, the way they look at sustainability is limited.In practice, Abdulhasan says, this means ※using solar panels to feed air-conditioning machines on the roof of fully [glass] glazed buildings. But why do I have a fully glazed building, as I need to pump more energy to cool it?§How will such an energy-intensive city cope as the abundance of resources such as oil and water dwindle? Dr Mohammed al-Rashid of the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research predicts that by 2030, ※30% of the oil produced here will be needed for electricity and water production§.Around 99% of the country＊s fresh water comes from desalination, itself an energy-intensive process currently heavily dependent on oil. Covered reservoirs, blue-and-white striped like candy, jut out of the dusty landscape along desert highways 每 essential in a region with the highest water consumption in the world. And yet here, water is heavily subsidised by the government: the average consumer pays just over ?2 [0.8 Kuwaiti dinars] per 1,000 gallons, supplementing the real price of ?25.50 [10 KWD].Though Kuwait has the second-largest reserve of water in the Gulf Cooperation Council 每 made up of the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait 每 this is only enough for nine days＊ worth of consumption, says al-Rashid, though it could last 50 days with conservation. Either way, it is clear that the city-state is heading towards an existential crisis in a world that needs to learn to live without oil. One solution AGi proposes is a rethinking of the way buildings are designed, offering an alternative to the large, glass-clad structures reliant on continuous air conditioning. The firm＊s creations are designed to use less energy from their inception, and are often inspired by  towers, clad in terracotta and with carefully-placed windows that face away from the sun. These draw in air from outdoors, channelling it across a pool of water at ground level to cool the entire building through a central courtyard. ※Environmentally, but also socially, it goes back to what the traditional city was like,§ says Aisha Alsager, managing director of AGi.Al-Kandari of the EPA also explains that construction on an $4bn eco-friendly ※smart city§ for Kuwait will begin in 2019. ※This means applying technology to make life easier,§ he says. ※The city will have buses, not cars, for transportation. There will be more places for walking, and sensors will monitor water consumption, helping us to reuse water. Air conditioning will be controlled by block, not by house.§The project will be built by a consortium of South Korean construction companies, and is expected to accommodate 25,000 to 40,000 households.But not everyone is convinced. ※They say they want to make a green city, but they haven＊t made the basis of what makes a greener city clear,§ says Dr Abulhasan of AGi. ※The only thing defined so far is using solar panels and better quality glazing 每 they haven＊t said shrink everything,§ he added, emphasising that becoming accustomed to living in smaller spaces is a key part of the transition to a more sustainable environment.※We need to change the way we live, and the way we move around the city,§ adds Alsager. ※Everywhere around the world is removing highways, and in Kuwait we＊re increasing them tenfold.§ Adapting to rising temperatures will require a radical shift in thinking in Kuwait, especially concerning the most vulnerable. ※We can＊t manage the way these companies work,§ says the construction manager, referring to the contractors who incentivise labourers to work outside in punishing conditions. ※Of course, when I see labourers working after midday in this heat, it＊s horrible. But what can we do? It＊s their rules.§ "																																																			
"mericans drink enough bottled water each week to circle the globe two times around. That was one of the many alarming facts that motivated politicians in  to pursue a progressive environmental regulation no other major US city had dared 每 a ban on bottled water.The liberal California city had previously  the way on banning plastic shopping bags, but the 2014 proposal to restrict bottled water was more modest. Although the board of supervisors voted unanimously to phase out the sale of single-use plastic water bottles, the rule only applied to city property. ※Given America＊s addiction to plastic water bottles, we knew we had to be smart,§ said David Chiu, a state assemblyman who introduced the measure when he was a San Francisco supervisor. ※There were members of the public who couldn＊t imagine life without plastic water bottles.§ So even though San Francisco is known as one of the most environmentally progressive cities in the country 每 the  in the US to pass a comprehensive mandatory recycling and composting law 每 officials limited the bottled water ban to city-owned land, leaving private businesses unaffected. The ordinance, which has expanded in recent years, also bars the sale of bottled water at large events on city properties and prohibits San Francisco government agencies from purchasing plastic bottled water. Legislators also called for increased investment in water fountains, filling stations and event water hook-ups. ※San Francisco has wonderful, high-quality water,§ said Tyrone Jue, senior advisor on the environment in the mayor＊s office. ※It＊s more heavily regulated than the water you＊re getting in bottles.§ Even limited to city property, the rollout of the law hasn＊t always been easy. Banned from selling bottled water at city events, some vendors switched to alternatives that are also ecologically harmful, such as water in cans, glass bottles or other single-use containers. ※The packaging is as detrimental to the environment as the bottle in some ways,§ said Suzanne Gautier, a manager with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, which  event organizers comply with the law. Earlier this year, the city expanded the law to restrict the sale or distribution of ※packaged§ water on city property, including sealed boxes, bags, cans and other containers with a capacity of one liter or less. The city does not have data on the law＊s impacts on plastic waste reduction in the region. But given the fact that plastic bottles take centuries to decompose and that the vast majority of bottles end up in landfills, any decrease in consumption is a step in the right direction, environmental campaigners said. Chiu said he hoped the law could help shift the culture in California and beyond back to the habits that were common before bottled water exploded.He noted that people often forget how rapidly private corporations took over drinking water. In 1976, the average American  1.6 gallons of bottled water a year 每 a number that skyrocketed to 28.3 gallons three decades later. ※The bottled water industry has spent millions of dollars to convince us that the only place you can get safe water is from a bottle, and that we need this product,§ said Lauren DeRusha Florez, an associated campaign director with Corporate Accountability International, a nonprofit group that backed San Francisco＊s measure. More than 100 American cities have adopted measures to restrict government spending on bottled water, and bans have also spread at  and . But Florez said San Francisco＊s measure is particularly forward-thinking in the way it prioritizes increasing access to safe tap water, which is critical at a time when there are  about  in the US following the . ※The city is reinforcing water as a public good rather than a commodity that can be bought and sold by corporations.§ San Francisco is not currently exploring a broader citywide prohibition on bottled water, but following the success of major plastic bag bans across the country, environmental activists are increasingly turning their attention to bottles, Flores added.※There＊s a growing movement of folks who are looking for the next project.§"																																																			
"A million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute and the number will jump another 20% by 2021, creating an environmental crisis some campaigners predict will be as serious as climate change.New figures obtained by the Guardian reveal the surge in usage of plastic bottles, more than half a trillion of which will be sold annually by the end of the decade. The demand, equivalent to about 20,000 bottles being bought every second, is driven by an apparently insatiable desire for bottled water and the spread of a western, urbanised ※on the go§ culture to  and the Asia Pacific region.More than 480bn plastic drinking bottles were sold in 2016 across the world, up from about 300bn a decade ago. If placed end to end, they would extend more than halfway to the sun. By 2021 this will increase to 583.3bn, according to the most up-to-date estimates from Euromonitor International＊s global packaging trends report.Most plastic bottles used for soft drinks and water are made from polyethylene terephthalate (Pet), which is highly recyclable. But as their use soars across the globe, efforts to collect and recycle the bottles to keep them from polluting the oceans, are failing to keep up. Fewer than half of the bottles bought in 2016 were collected for recycling and just 7% of those collected were turned into new bottles. Instead most plastic bottles produced end up in landfill or in the ocean. Between 5m and 13m tonnes of plastic leaks into the world＊s oceans each year to be ingested by sea birds, fish and other organisms, and by 2050 the ocean will contain more plastic by weight than fish,  by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.Experts warn that some of it is already finding its way into the human food chain.Scientists at Ghent University in Belgium  people who eat seafood ingest up to 11,000 tiny pieces of plastic every year. Last August,  reported plastic was found in a third of UK-caught fish, including cod, haddock, mackerel and shellfish. Last year, , citing increasing concern for human health and food safety ※given the potential for microplastic pollution in edible tissues of commercial fish§.Dame , the round the world yachtswoman, now campaigns to promote a circular economy in which plastic bottles are reused, refilled and recycled rather than used once and thrown away.※Shifting to a real circular economy for plastics is a massive opportunity to close the loop, save billions of dollars, and decouple plastics production from fossil fuel consumption,§ she said.Hugo Tagholm, of the marine conservation and campaigning group Surfers Against Sewage, said the figures were devastating. ※The plastic pollution crisis rivals the threat of climate change as it pollutes every natural system and an increasing number of organisms on planet Earth.※Current science shows that plastics cannot be usefully assimilated into the food chain. Where they are ingested they carry toxins that work their way on to our dinner plates.§ Surfers Against Sewage are campaigning for  to be introduced in the UK as a way of encouraging reuse.Tagholm added: ※Whilst the production of throwaway plastics has grown dramatically over the last 20 years, the systems to contain, control, reuse and recycle them just haven＊t kept pace.§In the UK 38.5m plastic bottles are used every day 每 only just over half make it to recycling, while more than 16m are put into landfill, burnt or leak into the environment and oceans each day.※Plastic production is set to double in the next 20 years and quadruple by 2050 so the time to act is now,§ said Tagholm.There has been growing concern about the impact of plastics pollution in oceans around the world. Last month scientists found .Another study . And earlier this week scientists warned that plastic bottles and other packaging , endangering wildlife from basking sharks to puffins.The majority of plastic bottles used across the globe are for drinking water, , according to Rosemary Downey, head of packaging at Euromonitor and one of the world＊s experts in plastic bottle production.China is responsible for most of the increase in demand. The Chinese public＊s consumption of bottled water accounted for nearly a quarter of global demand, she said.※It is a critical country to understand when examining global sales of plastic Pet bottles, and China＊s requirement for plastic bottles continues to expand,§ said Downey.In 2015, consumers in China purchased 68.4bn bottles of water and in 2016 this increased to 73.8bn bottles, up 5.4bn.※This increase is being driven by increased urbanisation,§ said Downey. ※There is a desire for healthy living and there are ongoing concerns about groundwater contamination and the quality of tap water, which all contribute to the increase in bottle water use,§ she said. India and Indonesia are also witnessing strong growth.Plastic bottles are a big part of the huge surge in usage of a material first popularised in the 1940s. Most of the plastic produced since then still exists; the petrochemical-based compound takes hundreds of years to decompose.Major drinks brands produce the greatest numbers of plastic bottles. Coca-Cola produces more than 100bn throwaway plastic bottles every year 每 or 3,400 a second, according to analysis carried out by Greenpeace after the company refused to publicly disclose its global plastic usage. The top six drinks companies in the world use a combined average of just 6.6% of recycled Pet in their products, according to Greenpeace. A third have no targets to increase their use of recycled plastic and none are aiming to use 100% across their global production.Plastic drinking bottles could be made out of 100% recycled plastic, known as RPet 每 and campaigners are pressing big drinks companies to radically increase the amount of recycled plastic in their bottles. But brands are hostile to using RPet for cosmetic reasons because they want their products in shiny, clear plastic, according to Steve Morgan, of Recoup in the UK.In evidence to a House of Commons committee, the British  Federation (BPF), a plastics trade body, admitted that making bottles out of 100% recycled plastic used 75% less energy than creating virgin plastic bottles. But the BPF said that brands should not be forced to increase the recycled content of bottles. ※The recycled content ... can be up to 100%, however this is a decision made by brands based on a variety of factors,§ said Philip Law, director general of the BPF.The industry is also resisting any taxes or charges to reduce demand for single-use plastic bottles 每 like the 5p charge on plastic bags that is credited with reducing plastic bag use by 80%. Coca Cola said it was still considering requests from Greenpeace to publish its global plastics usage. A spokeswoman said: ※Globally, we continue to increase the use of recycled plastic in countries where it is feasible and permitted. We continue to increase the use of RPet in markets where it is feasible and approved for regulatory food-grade use 每 44 countries of the more than 200 we operate in.§ She agreed plastic bottles could be made out of 100 percent recycled plastic but there was nowhere near enough high quality food grade plastic available on the scale that was needed to increase the quantity of rPET to that level. ※So if we are to increase the amount of recycled plastic in our bottles even further then a new approach is needed to create a circular economy for plastic bottles,§ she said. Greenpeace said the had to do more to increase the recycled content of their plastic bottles. ※During Greenpeace＊s recent expedition exploring plastic pollution on remote Scottish coastlines, we found plastic bottles nearly everywhere we went,§ said Louisa Casson, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace.※It＊s clear that the soft drinks industry needs to reduce its plastic footprint.§"																																																			
"Swiss police say hundreds of bodies of mountaineers who have gone missing in the Alps in the past century could emerge in coming years as global warming forces the country＊s glaciers to retreat.Alpine authorities have registered a significant increase in the number of human remains discovered last month, with the body of a man missing for 30 years the most recent to be uncovered.Rescue teams in Saas Valley in the Valais canton were called last Tuesday after two climbers retreating from an aborted ascent spotted a hand and two shoes protruding from the Hohlaub glacier.Rescuers spent two hours freeing the mummified body with icepicks and their bare hands, also recovering a silver wristwatch and a ring. A helicopter flew the remains to Bern, where forensics experts matched the DNA to that of a German citizen, born in 1943, who had gone missing on a hike in 11 August 1987. One rescue worker said the man had worn shoes ※unsuitable§ for walking on ice, suggesting he may have slipped after walking a few metres onto the glacier and fallen down a crevice. Both feet had become detached from the body, indicating the force of the fall.The discovery comes less than a week after the bodies of a , were found in the Tsanfleuron glacier in the same canton. Marcelin and Francine Dumoulin had disappeared after going out to milk their cows in a meadow above Chandolin on 15 August 1942.Last Thursday, the remains of a  believed to have been killed in an Air India crash more than 50 years ago was also discovered in the French Alps, on Mount Blanc.Switzerland＊s glaciers have been melting at an unprecedented rate, losing almost one cubic km in ice volume or about 900 bn litres of water over the past year. According to an investigation by  newspaper, eight of the 10 months in which the glaciers have lost the most in volume over the past century have been since 2008. Since 1850, when glaciers covered 1,735 sq km (670 sq miles) of Swiss land, the total area has shrunk by a half, to about 890 sq km.Police in Valais expect the bodies of many more missing persons to emerge because of global warming. ※It＊s quite clear,§ a spokesman, Christian Zuber, told the Guardian. ※The glaciers are retreating, so it＊s logical that we＊re finding more and more bodies and body parts. In the coming years we expect that many more cases of missing persons will be resolved.§He said a map that lists everyone who had gone missing since 1925 to the present day contains 306 names and locations, one fewer since the discovery of the German mountaineer.At least 160 alpinists remain missing in France＊s Mont Blanc massif, and the Morteratsch glacier in Graub邦nden is believed to contain the bodies of 40 mountaineers.Zuber described the ※great relief§ at being able to pass on the information to the families ※who would otherwise never know with 100% certainty whether their loved one had perished on the mountain. Finally when a corpse is discovered, you have an absolute guarantee§, he said.He said that feeling had also been palpable earlier this year when a local woman was able to retrieve the bodies of her dead parents, the Dumoulins, who had disappeared when she was just four years old. ※We locals are obviously used to the mountains, but such discoveries are no less emotional for the people here,§ he said.Rolf Trachsel, head of mountain rescue in Saas-Fee, who led the operation to recover the German man＊s body, said it had been discovered in an area popular with hikers. ※There was very little snow, and it was not very steep. It was about half an hour＊s hike away from the next mountain cable-car station.§He said although the team had to deal with the sad fact they were recovering a dead man, they also felt considerable relief. ※If someone has gone missing, logic tells you their body has to turn up again one day,§ Trachsel said. ※It＊s obviously good that we can put our efforts into recovering someone, especially after 30 years, and knowing how important it is for the family to find out what happened.§The body was taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine (IRM) at the University of Bern by helicopter for examination and formal identification where it is still being held. Christian Jackowski, a scientist at IRM, said the discovery of human remains was now a regular feature of the Swiss summer holiday season, as climbers started to swarm the Valais region＊s ice-covered mountains.Usually bodies emerged from the ice at the top of the glacier, rather than its ※tongue§ at the bottom of the valley, Jackowski said. The extent to which bodies have been preserved by the ice depends on the circumstances of the person＊s demise, with some human remains having been mummified by sunshine and dry winds before being engulfed in ice, while others have been reduced to skeletons.The majority of bodies are trapped in ice, crevices or streams after an accident or a suicide, though some cases are treated in relation to criminal cases.Other bodies could be the victims of military skirmishes. Though Switzerland stayed neutral in world wars one and two, the Mont Blanc massif became a frontline towards the end of the second world war amid .In most cases, forensic experts face a race against time once bodies have been removed from the ice and start to thaw. Dental records and DNA samples are checked against a database of missing people to determine the identity of the corpse. Since 2000, authorities in  have taken DNA samples of missing people＊s family members immediately after their disappearance to facilitate the process."																																																			
"Eleven southern and central European countries have issued extreme heat warnings amid a brutal heatwave nicknamed Lucifer, with residents and tourists urged to take precautions and scientists warning worse could be still to come.Authorities in countries including Italy, Switzerland, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia are on red alert, , and swaths of southern Spain and France are on amber.As temperatures in many places hit or exceeded 40C (104F) in the region＊s most sustained heatwave since 2003, emergency services are being put on standby and people have been asked to ※remain vigilant§, stay indoors, avoid long journeys, drink enough fluids and listen for emergency advice from health officials. At least two people have died from the heat, one in Romania and one in , and many more taken to hospital suffering from sunstroke and other heat-related conditions. Italy said its hospitalisation rate was 15% above normal and asked people in affected regions only to travel if their journey was essential. Polish officials warned of possible infrastructure failures.A spokeswoman for Abta, the UK travel trade organisation, reinforced the advice for holidaymakers, saying they should take sensible precautions, keep hydrated by drinking plenty of water, stay out of the sun in the middle of the day, and follow any advice issued by health authorities in specific destinations. The heatwave, now in its fourth day and expected to last until next Wednesday,  that fuelled a spate of major wildfires, exacerbated droughts in Italy and Spain, and damaged crops. The highest temperature on Thursday was 42C in Cordoba, Spain, and Catania, Italy. . The spell is forecast to peak at the weekend with temperatures of 46C or higher in Italy and parts of the Balkans.Authorities in , which is suffering its worst drought in 60 years, have placed 26 cities on the maximum extreme heat alert, including Venice and Rome. Many of Rome＊s fountains have been turned off, and last week the city only narrowly averted drastic water rationing.In Florence, the Uffizi art gallery was temporarily closed on Friday when the air-conditioning system broke down. In , keepers at Budapest zoo cooled down two overheating polar bears with huge ice blocks.Temperatures along parts of Croatia＊s Adriatic coast, including Dubrovnik, were expected to hit 42C during the day. In the Serbian capital of Belgrade there were reports of people fainting from heat exhaustion.Highs in , including in popular holiday resorts on the Costa del Sol and on the island of Majorca, are set to reach 43C this weekend, with extreme conditions also forecast in Seville, Malaga and Granada. Ibiza and Mallorca could hit 42C, Spain＊s Aemet meteorological service warned.While Europe＊s record high is 48C, set in Athens in 1977, current temperatures are in many places as much as 10-15C higher than normal for the time of year and likely to result in more fatalities, experts have said. resulted in more than 20,000 heat-related deaths, mainly of old and vulnerable people, including 15,000 in France, where temporary mortuaries were set up in refrigerated lorries. Such spells of extreme heat in southern Europe could be a foretaste of things to come.  summer conditions in some of the continent＊s popular tourist destinations could become significantly tougher.Writing in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the scientists said if a similar ※mega-heatwave§ to that of 2003 were to occur at the end of the century, when average temperatures are widely expected to be noticeably higher after decades of global warming, temperatures could pass 50C.The researchers noted that climate models suggest ※human influence is expected to significantly increase the frequency, duration and intensity of heatwaves in Europe§ and said their modelling suggested that by 2100, peak summer temperatures could rise by between 6C and 13C against historical records. The village of  of France hit 44.1C on two occasions in the summer of 2003, the highest temperature ever recorded in the country, meaning ※the record maximum value could easily exceed 50C by the end of the 21st century§, the scientists concluded.The current extreme temperatures, coupled with strong winds, have fanned wildfires that have already  and caused widespread damage in southern France, Greece and Italy. About 300 firefighters and military personnel were fighting 75 wildfires on Friday in Albania, with firefighters also busy in Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, , Greece and the French island of Corsica.In Italy, fires killed a 79-year-old woman in the central Abruzzo region and forced the closure of the main Via Aurelia coastal motorway that runs northwards from Rome to the Italian Riviera. The country＊s winemakers have started harvesting their grapes weeks earlier than usual due to the heat. The founder of the Slow Food movement, Carlo Petrini, said no harvest in living memory had begun before 15 August.The heatwave is likely to cost Italy＊s agricultural sector billions of euros, with as many as 11 regions facing critical water shortages. Olive yields in some areas are forecast to be down 50% and some milk production has fallen by up to 30%.Bosnian officials said the heatwave and drought had nearly halved agricultural output, which represents 10% of the country＊s economic output, and Serbia said its corn production could be cut a third.

"Plastic bottles and packaging are overrunning some of the UK＊s most beautiful beaches and remote coastline, endangering wildlife from basking sharks to puffins.A  research ship has spent the past two months touring the Scottish coast and islands assessing the impact of plastic waste.Marine scientists on the Greenpeace ship Beluga II will undertake a detailed analysis of the results over the next two months. But the initial findings from the voyage paint a bleak picture:The findings follow a series of recent reports that highlight the growing problem of plastics pollution in oceans around the world.Last month scientists found .The tiny landmass in the eastern South Pacific, was found to have the highest density of anthropogenic debris recorded anywhere in the world, with 99.8% of the pollution plastic.Another study .On Tuesday the Beluga II is due to arrive in Edinburgh. Tisha Brown, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace, described the initial findings as shocking.※It cannot be right that our beaches, seas and the stunning wildlife they are home to should become the final dumping ground for throwaway plastic bottles and other plastic trash.§ She said ※a truckload§ of plastic was entering the world＊s oceans every minute.※We need urgent action from governments and from major soft drinks companies which produce billions of single-use plastic bottles every year, like , to stop the flow of plastic into the sea.§Campaigners in Scotland will deliver a petition to Scotland＊s environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham on Tuesday calling for the introduction of a deposit return scheme for drinks containers in . Similar schemes have been shown to increase collection rates of plastic bottles to as much as 95% in other countries, drastically reducing the number ending up in the environment.The Greenpeace expedition assessed plastic pollution in sites of scientific importance and biodiversity, including Bass Rock, Gunna Sound, Mull, R迄m, Eigg, Skye, and the Shiant Isles in the Outer Hebrides.The charity said the extent of the plastic pollution they found was ※a shocking testament to our throwaway culture§. Brown added: ※We ... witnessed plastic pollution in the beaks of puffins, in the waters where basking sharks feed, and even wrapped around the beak of an emaciated gannet. We found plastic bottle tops, bags, packaging, bits of old fishing gear and even crisp packets strewn across the island and surrounding eggs in nests. It＊s no wonder that studies have shown that 90% of seabirds have eaten plastic.§ But she said it was not too late to ※preserve these remote shores and the wildlife they are home to§.※We need urgent action from governments and from major soft drinks companies which produce billions of single-use plastic bottles every year.§"																																																			
"Extreme heatwaves that kill even healthy people within hours will strike parts of the Indian subcontinent unless global carbon emissions are cut sharply and soon, according to new research.Even outside of these hotspots, three-quarters of the 1.7bn population 每 particularly those farming in the Ganges and Indus valleys 每 will be exposed to a level of humid heat classed as posing ※extreme danger§ towards the end of the century.The new analysis assesses the impact of climate change on the deadly combination of heat and humidity, measured as the ※wet bulb§ temperature (WBT). Once this reaches 35C, the human body cannot cool itself by sweating and even fit people sitting in the shade will die within six hours.The revelations show the most severe impacts of global warming may strike those nations, such as , whose carbon emissions are still rising as they lift millions of people out of poverty.※It presents a dilemma for India between the need to grow economically at a fast pace, consuming fossil fuels, and the need to avoid such potentially lethal impacts,§ said Prof Elfatih Eltahir, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US who led the new study. ※To India, global climate change is no longer abstract 每 it is about how to save potentially vulnerable populations.§Heatwaves are already a major risk in South Asia, with a severe episode in 2015 leading to 3,500 deaths, and  in 2016 when the temperature in the city of Phalodi, Rajasthan, hit 51C. Another new study this week linked the impact of .Eltahir said poor farmers are most at risk from future humid heatwaves, but have contributed very little to the emissions that drive climate change. The eastern part of China, another populous region where emissions are rising, is also on track for extreme heatwaves and this risk is currently being examined by the scientists.Their , showed the Gulf in the Middle East, the heartland of the global oil industry, will also suffer heatwaves beyond the limit of human survival if climate change is unchecked, particularly Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha and coastal cities in Iran.The new work, , used carefully selected computer climate models that accurately simulate the past climate of the South Asia to conduct a high resolution analysis of the region, down to 25km.The scientists found that under a business-as-usual scenario, where carbon emissions are not curbed, 4% of the population would suffer unsurvivable six-hour heatwaves of 35C WBT at least once between 2071-2100. The affected cities include Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh and Patna in Bihar, each currently home to more than two million people.Vast areas of South Asia 每 covering 75% of the area＊s population 每 would endure at least one heatwave of 31C WBT. This is already above the level deemed by the US National Weather Service to represent  with its warning stating: ※If you don＊t take precautions immediately when conditions are extreme, .§However, if emissions are reduced roughly in line with the global Paris climate change agreement, there would be no 35C WBT heatwaves and the population affected by the 31C WBT events falls from 75% to 55%. About 15% exposed are today. The analysis also showed that the dangerous 31C WBT level would be passed once every two years for 30% of the population 每 more than 500 million people 每 if climate change is unchecked, but for only 2% of the population if the Paris goals are met. ※The problem is very alarming but the intensity of the heatwaves can be reduced considerably if global society takes action,§ said Eltahir.South Asia is particularly at risk from these extreme heatwaves because the annual monsoon brings hot and humid air on to the land. The widespread use of irrigation adds to the risk, because evaporation of the water increases humidity. The projected extremes are higher in the Gulf in the Middle East, but there they mostly occur over the gulf itself, rather than on land as in South Asia.The limit of survivability, at 35C WBT, was almost reached in  in July 2015, where 46C heat combined with 50% humidity. ※This suggests the threshold may be breached sooner than projected,§ said the researchers. Prof Christoph Sch?r, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, and who was not involved in the study, said: ※This is a solid piece of work, which will likely shape our perception of future climate change. In my view, the results are of concern and alarming.§The report demonstrates the urgency of measures to both cut emissions and help people cope better with such heatwaves, he said. There are uncertainties in the modelling 每 which Sch?r noted could underestimate or overestimate the impacts 每 as representing monsoon climates can be difficult and historical data is relatively scarce.Prof Chris Huntingford, at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: ※If given just one word to describe climate change, then ＆unfairness＊ would be a good candidate. Raised levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are expected to cause deadly heatwaves for much of South Asia. Yet many of those living there will have contributed little to climate change.§"																																																			
"Just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world＊s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a new report.The  (pdf) ※pinpoints how a relatively small set of fossil fuel producers may hold the key to systemic change on carbon emissions,§ says Pedro Faria, technical director at environmental non-profit CDP, which published the report in collaboration with the Climate Accountability Institute. Traditionally, large scale greenhouse gas emissions data is collected at a national level but this report focuses on fossil fuel producers. Compiled from a database of publicly available emissions figures, it is intended as the first in a series of publications to highlight the role companies and their investors could play in tackling climate change. The report found that more than half of global industrial emissions since 1988 每 the year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established 每 can be traced to just 25 corporate and state-owned entities. The scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to climate change, according to the report. ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988. If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 28 years as they were between 1988 and 2017, says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by 4C by the end of the century. This is likely to have  including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.While companies have a huge role to play in driving climate change, says Faria, the barrier is the ※absolute tension§ between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.A  in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting  over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on climate change and advances in renewables 每 in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.CDP says its aims with the carbon majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings. A fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. ※That puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with carbon majors and urge them to disclose climate risk,§ says Faria.Investors should move out of fossil fuels, says Michael Brune, executive director of US environmental organisation the Sierra Club. ※Not only is it morally risky, it＊s economically risky. The world is moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy and is doing so at an accelerated pace. Those left holding investments in fossil fuel companies will find their investments becoming more and more risky over time.§There is a ※growing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,§ says Brune. Nearly 100 companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Ikea have committed to 100% renewable power under the .  that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019. And oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments. Shell set up  in 2015 with a $1.7bn investment attached and a spokesperson for Chevron says it＊s ※committed to managing its [greenhouse gas] emissions§ and is investing in two of the world＊s largest  to capture and store carbon. A BP spokesperson says its ※determined to be part of the solution§ for climate change and is ※investing in renewables and low-carbon innovation.§ And ExxonMobil, which has faced  for its environmental record, has been .But for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. A research paper published last year by Paul Stevens, an academic at think tank Chatham House, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a  within the next 10 years if they did not completely change their business models. Investors now have a choice, according to Charlie Kronick, senior programme advisor at Greenpeace UK. ※The future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops?§"																																																			
"A total ban on ivory sales in the UK could still be introduced by the British government, foreign secretary  has said, signalling a possible U-turn that has been welcomed by conservationists.In their 2015 manifesto the  promised to ※press for a total ban on ivory sales§. But the pledge was quietly taken out of this year＊s Tory manifesto, sparking anger among conservation organisations, which say that by allowing the trade to continue, the UK is fuelling elephant poaching.Now Johnson seems to have returned to the Conservative＊s previous position, saying the government still ※intends to pursue§ an all-out ban.When questioned about the government＊s stance on the ivory trade in the House of Commons on 11 July, he said: ※We have a commitment in this government to an all-out ban on the sale of ivory in this country and that is what we intend to pursue.§Animal rights campaigners welcomed his declaration. Heather Sohl, chief adviser on wildlife at WWF-UK, called it a ※promise that many have been waiting a long time for. With an elephant being poached on average every 25 minutes, it＊s clear that urgent action is needed.§Charlie Mayhew, chief executive of Tusk, said the UK-based wildlife NGO was ※naturally encouraged§ to hear Johnson＊s statements. ※We believe that the government will follow through with new legislation to curb the ivory trade in the UK.§He said it would be ※too shaming§ if the UK does not close down its domestic trade, considering it will  on the illegal wildlife trade in 2018. ※It is imperative that we demonstrate to the world that the UK, which is still the largest exporter of ivory in the EU, has managed to close down its own markets.§The writer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who has campaigned against the ivory trade, commented: ※It was a massive disappointment ＃ that the Tories dropped their commitment to a ban on domestic ivory from their manifesto, and if that ban is now officially back on the agenda, that is excellent news.§Johnson, alongside former foreign secretary William Hague and former environment secretary Owen Paterson, has in the past openly , which was a Conservative manifesto commitment in 2010 and 2015.The UK has been accused of lagging behind other nations after China 每 the biggest market for ivory 每 announced.Last year countries party to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) reached a landmark international agreement to shut down domestic ivory markets.But there was no mention of ivory in this year＊s Tory manifesto. It is believed the government came under pressure from the UK＊s auction houses and antique dealers, who campaigned against a total ban. Currently the trade in ivory antiques (items produced before 1947) is permitted.Animal rights campaigners believe laws to regulate the ivory trade are ineffective and perpetuate illicit sales, driving rhino and elephant poaching. As many as 20,000 elephants were killed for their tusks in 2015. ※Putting the interests of a tiny proportion of the UK antiques trade ahead of the interests of Africa＊s elephants is unacceptable,§ said Fearnley-Whittingstall. ※These continued exports of both legal and illegal pieces from the UK make us complicit in the illegal trade of ivory and the continuing slaughter of Africa＊s elephants. If we want to claim to be leaders in conservation, and the fight against the illegal wildlife trade, then we need to show solidarity with the US and China, and indeed France, who are in the process of wrapping up their domestic ivory trades once and for all.§Action for Elephants＊ Denise Dresner said: ※Modern (illegal) ivory is sold in the UK under the cover of the legal trade and such sales perpetuate the poaching of elephants. The government must decide whether it＊s more important to bow to the self-serving interests of a small commercial sector - the antiques trade - or do everything in its power to save elephants from extinction in the wild.§"																																																			
"The government＊s attempt to delay publishing its air pollution strategy because of the election is ※dishonest§ and leaves ministers on ※very dodgy ground§, according to constitutional experts.The government had been under a court direction to produce tougher draft measures to tackle illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution, which is responsible for thousands of premature deaths each year, by 4pm on Monday. The original plans had been dismissed by judges .But after Theresa May called a , ministers lodged a lengthy application to the court late on Friday. It asked judges to allow them to breach the Monday deadline to ※comply with pre-election propriety rules§.Politicians and environmental groups reacted with anger, . Health experts warned the persistent lack of government action had potentially put thousands of lives at risk.The environment minister, , defended the decision during an emergency debate on Monday, saying she was ※personally deeply committed to the importance of ensuring clean air§, but had been told by officials in the Cabinet Office that it would breach purdah rules to publish the plans in the run-up to the election.However, constitutional experts dismissed that claim on Tuesday, saying it was a political choice.Dr Catherine Haddon, a constitutional expert at the Institute for Government, said purdah should not have prevented the publication of the report or the subsequent consultation. ※There is nothing in their own purdah guidance that prevents them publishing this if they had wanted to.§She said the government had started the purdah period 每 which normally only kicks in once parliament has been dissolved 每 unusually early. And even then, she added, there was an exemption once purdah is active for issues that are deemed to be safeguarding public health. ※In the end it was a political choice to implement purdah early and interpret the guidance in this way,§ she said.Colin Talbot, professor of government at Manchester University, said the government was on ※very dodgy ground§.※Purdah rules normally only come into effect when parliament is dissolved, not as soon as an election is called. In this case it is quite clear they have stretched the definition considerably.§ He said the move seemed to be overtly political. ※They have stretched the time limit, it has no legal standing and it seems to be completely selective 每 they are settling other bits of legislation and government announcements 每 so I think it is pretty clear they are just using this as an excuse not to put out this particular policy statement.§Dr Jo Murkens, an expert in constitutional law at the London School of Economics, said citing purdah not only went ※against the spirit of this court judgment, it is also dishonest.§He also believed the government was on shaky legal ground. He cited the  when the government tried to get round a judicial decision to release Prince Charles＊s letters. ※The supreme court said in no uncertain terms that a governmental veto was impermissible 每 a judicial decision, even one from a lowly tribunal, is binding on the government.※If you apply that here you have on the one hand a political convention with no legal weight regulating restrictions during the purdah period, and on the other hand a legally binding decision of the high court. The government should not be able to use purdah to thwart an order from the high court.§The scale of the air pollution crisis, which is responsible for 40,000 premature deaths a year, was revealed in a joint . It showed hundreds of thousands of children were being educated within 150 metres of a road where levels of nitrogen dioxide from diesel traffic breached legal limits.Last week figures obtained by , representing 59.3% of the UK population, were living in areas where levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution were above legal limits.The government has now been ordered back to the high court on Thursday to defend its application to delay its air quality plan.James Thornton, CEO of the environmental lawyers ClientEarth, who brought the original case against the government, said its lawyers would present their response at the hearing.※This is a matter for the court to decide once the government has made its arguments because it is the government which has not met, and instead seeks to extend, the court＊s deadline for the clean air plan, to clean up our air.§Leadsom, who also revealed that it was the second application to delay publication that her department had submitted to the courts, insisted the move would not postpone the rollout of the proposals.She said it showed the government was ※safeguarding§ democracy by not using the machinery of government for electoral advantage, and that the plan was now to issue the draft proposals on 30 June, followed by the full policy in September.

Once again, drought has struck, devastating cereal crops, threatening the olive and grape harvest and leaving livestock short of food and water.※This is an awful year 每 the worst we＊ve had over the past decade 每 and it＊s one of those that costs you a lot of money,§ says Garc赤a de la Pe?a. ※There＊s been no rain 每 and here, everything depends on the spring and autumn rains.§His 400 cows may need to be given ready-mixed feed for eight or nine months rather than the usual five, and the water situation is another expensive headache. If the ponds run dry, Garc赤a de la Pe?a will have to start sinking wells, around 100 metres deep, in his land. The wells cost 35 a metre to dig and then there are the solar-powered pumps to consider. All in all, he could find himself losing 30,000 (?26,347) this year as he tries to ride out the drought.※I hope I can make it up next year. I hope I won＊t go into the red, but it＊s a possibility.§Things in neighbouring, northwestern Castilla y Le車n are worse still. The drought has ravaged the area, which is known as Spain＊s granary, cutting the wheat and barley harvest by 50%.Jos谷 Roales, who grows wheat, barley, peas, sunflowers, chickpeas, lentils, and alfalfa in the region＊s Zamora province, is one of many staring at an alarming balance sheet. ※I＊ve been harvesting 1,000kg of cereals per hectare,§ the farmer says. ※In a normal year I＊d get 4,000kg per hectare. The thing is that the first 2,500kg goes on covering my costs. That gives you an idea of how things are this year.§But, says Roales 每 who is also the cereals chief of the COAG farming association 每 others are suffering even more. ※Given how things are in other bits of Castilla y Le車n, I still consider myself lucky. In Palencia province, 80% of the cereals haven＊t been reaped this year. It＊s far, far worse.§According to the Spanish farming association Asaja, the country is suffering from both a lack of rain over the past five or six years and the gradual diminishing and salinisation of water in aquifers and wells near the coast, which makes irrigation difficult. With the Duero, Segura and J迆car river basins already officially declared to be in drought and some areas seeing 75% less rainfall this year, the focus is now turning to how the drought could affect olives, almonds, pistachios and walnuts.※All those are tree crops; they have well-established roots that will seek out water deep in the ground, so it will take longer to see how the drought affects them,§ says a technical spokesman for Asaja. ※It＊s going to be a really, really tough year. But we won＊t know just how tough until the autumn.§By then, the drought＊s effect on Spain＊s vineyards should also be apparent. Jos谷 Joaqu赤n Vizca赤no, COAG＊s representative for the wine-producing sector, says that, while dry years and heat in June can improve grape quality, a prolonged dry spell would be unwelcome. ※If this heat continues into August and night-time temperatures are above 20C, ripening will be difficult,§ he says.Vizca赤no believes the high temperatures and lack of rain will see more vineyards turning to irrigation. ※The kind of climate change we are seeing year-to-year means that areas in the south, where the rains are shorter, are going to need more irrigation as a back-up during some times of the year, or years when it＊s very dry,§ he says. ※The proportion of irrigated vineyards has grown, and it＊s past 40%, nearly at 50%.§Roales, too, sees the evident and unwelcome hand of climate change at work in his fields. ※Older people 每 say, those over 80 每 tell us that 30 years ago winters were harder; it was colder and there was more rain, snow and frost. But as the years have gone by, they＊ve grown milder. Where we used to have four seasons, we now have only two: we＊re seeing spring and autumn disappear.§Garc赤a de la Pe?a has little choice but to keep on with his cows and the few bulls he raises for the ring. Despite the treacherous climate and the expense of cattle farming, he is ineluctably bound to his land.※You can put money into a farm until you＊re totally and utterly ruined: there are wells to sink and fences and paths to mend. But at the end of the day it＊s my life, and I wouldn＊t know how to do anything else anyway.※Maybe if I was 20 I＊d be able to change things, but not now. Back when I was fighting bulls, I＊d spend all night driving from N?mes so that I could get back to look after my cows. If you are from the country, you＊re from the country.§The day that the old bullfighter takes off his brown leather riding boots will be the day that he dies. ※Maybe we＊re the last Romantics,§ he says. ※I can＊t abandon the pastures; they have to carry on being pastures. What would Extremadura be without them?§"																																																			
																																																			
"The government has been ordered back to the high court to explain its last-minute bid to delay publication of the UK＊s clean air plan.Politicians and environmental groups  after they said they could not publish the proposals because of election purdah.The high court said on Tuesday that there would be a new hearing on Thursday where ministers will have to defend their application.James Thornton, CEO of the environmental lawyers ClientEarth, who brought the original case against the government, said they would present their response at the hearing on Thursday. ※This is a public health issue and not a political issue. Urgent action is required to protect people＊s health from the illegal and poisonous air that we are forced to breathe in the UK.※This is a matter for the court to decide once the government has made its arguments because it is the government which has not met, and instead seeks to extend, the court＊s deadline for the clean air plan, to clean up our air.§ Ministers had been under a court direction to produce tougher draft measures to tackle illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution, which is largely caused by , by 4pm on Monday. The original plans had been dismissed by judges .But after the announcement by Theresa May of a , ministers lodged a lengthy application to the court late on Friday. It asked judges to allow them to breach the Monday deadline to ※comply with pre-election propriety rules§. Politicians and environmental groups reacted with anger, claiming ministers were ※hiding behind the election§ to justify delaying publication of the government＊s long awaited proposals instead of tackling the UK＊s air pollution crisis.  experts warned the lack of government action had potentially put thousands of lives at risk.The mayor of London, , said: ※It is frankly outrageous that the government thinks it can continue to bury its head in the sand about the serious health impacts of air quality in London and across the country. The prime minister has once again missed this golden opportunity to show real leadership in tackling and improving the air we breathe, which should have been done well before the pre-election period.§, the environment secretary, was summoned to parliament on Monday to answer urgent questions. During the debate she said she was ※personally deeply committed to the importance of ensuring clean air§ but had been told by officials in the Cabinet Office that it would breach purdah rules to publish the plans in the run-up to the election.The government has applied to publish draft plans on 30 June followed by the full policy in September, she said.Leadsom, who also revealed that it was the second application to delay publication that her department had submitted to the courts, insisted the move would not postpone the rollout of the proposals.The scale of the air pollution crisis was revealed in a joint  showing hundreds of thousands of children were being educated within 150 metres of a road where levels of nitrogen dioxide from diesel traffic breached legal limits.Last week figures obtained by , representing 59.3% of the UK population, were living in areas where levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution were above legal limits.Research consistently shows that exposure to traffic fumes is harmful to children and adults. Children are  and exposure to nitrogen dioxide reduces lung growth, causes long-term ill health and can result in premature death.ClientEarth＊s lawyers will attend the hearing, which has been listed by the court for Thursday at 10.30am. The court has set aside two and a half hours."																																																			
																																																			
"utterflies are ubiquitous in our culture, via dresses, prints, cards and tattoos, but the humble caterpillar is surely overdue a revival. Whenever I＊ve paused by a sizeable nettle patch this year, I＊ve found them 每 writhing balls of black peacock caterpillars and black-and-fluorescent-lime small tortoiseshells. Less conspicuous are red admirals, which neatly stitch together two sides of nettle leaf and live inside a little tent.I＊ve seen Twitter pictures of  that had harboured hundreds of caterpillars, which will now never become butterflies.  would halt such destruction.The Victorians knew far more about caterpillars than we do because so many people reared their own. Although these specimens were killed when they emerged from their pupae to provide pristine butterflies for collections, Christian collectors (butterfly collecting was a genteel sport, perfectly befitting rural clergymen) saw themselves in the miracle of metamorphosis. Caterpillars were toiling, greedy earthbound creatures, like humans. If these wriggling maggots could ascend to the heavens via a coffin-like chrysalis, then so could we.Today, children remain the true connoisseurs of caterpillars, and last week I collected some for my son＊s forest school and for my animal-obsessed daughters. Some children are taught not to touch caterpillars but most have a keen sense of what it is to be one 每 via Eric Carle＊s classic book  每 and make empathic caterpillar wranglers (like the hero of Henrietta Rose-Innes＊ recent novel,  每 a welcome appearance for that rare species, the humane pest controller).I＊ve not hung out with caterpillars since childhood and I＊d forgotten what fabulous pets they are: busy, and oddly personable. The forest school class loved having caterpillars trotting up their arms, and solicitously ensured they were returned to their nettles. At home, we pick fresh nettles every day for our four small tortoiseshells. It＊s splendid to watch them dive into the fresh leaves with all the ardour of a hungry dog at its bowl.

"Australia＊s draft plan to improve water quality on the  has ignored official government scientific advice, which was published by the Queensland and federal governments alongside the new plan this week.The draft Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan is an update to the plan released in 2013, and provides new water quality targets for specific parts of the reef but has very few other concrete changes overall.That is despite the plan itself acknowledging that ※current initiatives will not meet water quality targets§, noting the ※urgently needed§ acceleration of efforts and explicitly stating that ※a step change is needed§.The plan repeatedly says it is ※based on the best available independent scientific advice, as provided by scientific consensus statement 2017§. But that statement, published alongside the plan, is highly critical of the approach taken in the plan.※Current initiatives will not meet the water quality targets,§ the consensus statement says, calling for increased support and resources, as well as regulation to reduce agricultural runoff 每 a recommendation .In line with every other piece of scientific advice, the consensus statement concludes the reef is in poor and deteriorating quality, and lays the blame for much of the situation on water quality.Scientists say that in the face of climate change and increased frequency and severity of bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, improved water quality is urgently needed to relieve some of the pressures and to make the reef more ※resilient§.The plan points to $2bn being spent over 10 years by the  and federal governments to protect the reef. But roughly half of that is being spent on water quality.That is about one-tenth of what a Queensland government taskforce concluded was needed, a figure they said would .One member of the Reef Water Quality Independent Science Panel that wrote the consensus statement, Jon Brodie from James Cook University, said the governments were not listening to their own expert advice.※In the end, the plan is not taking up the recommendations of the consensus statement at all,§ Brodie said.Asked whether the money being spent on initiatives not in line with expert advice meant the governments were wasting $1bn, Brodie said: ※That was asked recently by people from the government ＃ I think spending it as we are now ＃ is a bit silly.§Brodie said it was too late to spread the money across the entire reef and it was time to focus in on bits of the reef that might be able to be saved.※The issue we have now is the coral is in terminal condition and the best we can hope for is to protect some parts of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef,§ Brodie said.※We＊re still spending a lot of money but we＊re not achieving enough to provide resilience to the whole Great Barrier Reef, perhaps we could better spend it on providing resilience for just some of the coral.§The world heritage committee flagged its concern over reef water quality at its annual meeting in July, saying ※the plan will need to accelerate to ensure that the intermediate and long-term targets of 2050 LTSP are being met, in particular regarding water quality§.Sean Hoobin from WWF-Australia said the governments were ignoring those concerns.※There is no meaningful detail on the actions and investment needed to deliver promised cuts to reef pollution,§ he said.The minister for the environment and energy,  said in a statement: ※By focusing our efforts on improving water quality, we are giving the reef the best chance to adapt and recover from the impacts of coral bleaching.※This new plan has an expanded scope and addresses all land-based sources of water pollution including run-off from urban, industrial and public lands, as well as from agricultural activities.§The Queensland minister for the environment, Steven Miles, said the plan recognised the importance of people in creating change and included social, cultural and economic values for the first time.※The new plan sets water quality targets for each of the 35 catchments flowing to the reef using scientific modelling and other technical information to work out the pollution reduction targets based on what the Reef needs to be healthy,§ Miles said."																																																			
"There seems to be little understanding of the simple fact that electric vehicles (EV) are, in the main, pollution shifters 每 from tailpipe to power generation facility (). The electricity generation and transmission system is already tested to its limits during a harsh winter. Only if objections disappeared to the mass building of thousands of the largest wind turbines, plus similar numbers of hectares of photovoltaic solar generation, could the pollution shifters＊ argument be refuted. Even then, there would still be need for conventional or nuclear generation for when the sun doesn＊t shine and wind doesn＊t blow 每 doubling the capital requirement.Then there is the transmission system. Its capacity is based on ※averaging§. It assumes that not everyone will be using the full load available to their house at the same time. Each EV charging station takes minimum 3.3kW for around 12 hours 每 or 7.2kW for fast charging. It would be the equivalent of every house having an electric shower in service for many hours, all at the same time. The distribution system is simply not designed to cope with these simultaneous loads. If the government is serious about no new hydrocarbon-fuelled cars after 2040, we would need to start a programme of upgrades or replacement to the entire electricity distribution system.Backup power stations, particularly nuclear, need a long lead time. I＊ve heard nothing which gives me confidence that the government has any understanding of the size of the electricity infrastructure task to support the 2040 target. Even if that understanding exists, is it really feasible that private capital could be sourced to support a project with returns somewhere in the distant future? The Hinkley debacle suggests not. Can we really believe National Grid and the power network companies would or could build a new high-voltage grid, complete with substations, local transformers and upgraded street cables? I＊ll believe the government is serious when I hear a plan to build multiple power stations for completion in the 2040s and I see the digger, followed by a huge cable drum, coming down the street."																																																			
"he central highlands of  are a world away from the congested chaos of the country＊s cities. Hills roll across colossal, uninhabited spaces fringed by snow-flecked mountains, set against blistering blue skies.In this spectacular, harsh landscape, one can pinpoint more or less where human settlement becomes impossible: at an altitude of 3,000 metres (9,840ft). This is where Aziza＊s family lives, in the village of Borghason. In a good year, they just about survive by cultivating wheat and potatoes for food and a small income. However, when the rains fail, as they increasingly do, the family is plunged into debt, unable to reimburse merchants for that year＊s seeds. ※Last year, we had to borrow money from the bazaar,§ Aziza says.Things are about to get tougher. The precariousness of life in Bamiyan, one of Afghanistan＊s poorest provinces, leaves villages like Borghason at the mercy of climate change.On a recent visit, the Guardian trekked from freshwater lakes surrounded by jagged massifs at 4,500 metres down to villages at the receiving end of erratic weather, a common result of global warming. Warmer temperatures melt the mountain snow earlier, resulting in an increased flow of water before farmers need it.These are irregularities that farmers living at the margins of economic sustainability cannot afford. ※People are surviving,§ says Andrew Scanlon, country director for the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). ※[But] their ability to bounce back is almost zilch.§Farmers say unanimously that temperatures have risen over the past decades. Rain is scarcer and more unpredictable. ※People know about climate change even if they don＊t call it that,§ says Fatima Akbari, the UNEP＊s country assistant. ※They know all about change in water and weather.§Despite 15 years as one of the world＊s biggest receivers of international aid, much of it to agriculture, Afghanistan remains woefully underdeveloped and largely defenceless against jolts from nature. Western donors primarily poured money into short-sighted programmes such as heavy engineering and cash-for-work schemes, designed for ※quick impact§, Scanlon says.※Soldiers and engineers were on six-month contracts and needed to quickly win hearts and minds,§ he adds. Governments and engineers got accustomed to short time frames. Meanwhile, little was done to build long-term resilience. Winning hearts and minds was meant to win the war, yet climate change endangers that elusive victory.Although research on the topic in Afghanistan is limited to small-scale anthropological analyses,  and  link global warming and security. According to the UNEP, about 80% of conflicts in Afghanistan are related to resources like land and water 每 and to food insecurity, an immediate consequence of global warming.According  by the UNEP, the World Food Programme and the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), the biggest climate hazards to Afghan livelihoods are drought and floods, caused by irregular snowmelt or rainfall.Bamiyan is one of the places most at risk, but also the source of environmental problems elsewhere. The mountains in Shah Foladi, one of four recognised national parks, feed both the Kabul basin and the Helmand river, which runs south for 700 miles (1,126km). In Helmand, water has instigated conflict for decades and been central to foreign intervention since the early cold war, when the US got involved in irrigation projects.Despite fighting a worsening war against insurgents, the Afghan government seems, to an extent, aware of the need to address the risks of global warming. ※In the region, Afghanistan is the most vulnerable country facing the ravages of climate change,§ says Prince Mostapha Zaher, grandson of the former king Mohammad Zahir Shah and director general of the NEPA.Zaher, a trained microbiologist and a forceful presence, has entered Afghanistan into 14 international environmental conventions since 2005. Still, the government＊s priorities appear to fall short of his ambitions. Zaher describes the NEPA, which is not an actual ministry, as a ※fledgling agency on a shoestring budget§.He has spearheaded efforts to protect Afghanistan＊s extraordinary biodiversity by helping to name four areas as national parks. In June, marking , a wetlands site inside the city of Kabul became the latest. Kol-e-Hashmat Khan is a stopover for migratory birds of ※world-class importance§ and is visited by 150 species each year, according to the UNEP.Threats to the site come not just from the climate but from humans, too. Garbage is piled high on the water＊s edge. One-fourth of the site＊s nearly 200 hectares have been grabbed by ※strongmen§, who burn reeds and erect cream-coloured villas jutting from the banks. ※Afghanistan is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world,§ says Scanlon, adding that the country boasts about 3,000 endemic plants, almost four times more than Europe.National biodiversity is another victim of international donors, such as USAid, that subsidise fertiliser and pesticides to Afghan farmers, and have . Scanlon says international agencies generally have a ※poor understanding§ of Afghanistan＊s natural riches. ※I still speak to high-ranking officials from the World Bank, EU and other UN agencies who think Afghanistan is a desert, absolutely devoid of ecological value,§ he adds.In Bamiyan, the UNEP works to promote sustainable farming. In the village of Khoshgak, farmers used to cultivate the hills to take advantage of rainfall, but that drained them of all nourishment. Now, by collecting water in concrete basins fed by underground pipes, they grow apricots, barley and potatoes in the valley.※Before, there was nothing here. It was scorched,§ says Haji Qadir, a village elder, from his neatly manicured garden. Still, he remembers the valley of his childhood being more fertile. ※The air used to be cleaner, not full of dust like now.§Women are particularly affected by erratic weather. In Borghason, when the rains fail, farmers switch crops from barley to wheat, which is less ideal as livestock feed, says Chaman, an older woman in the village. As a result, women 每 who are tasked with fetching water and tending livestock 每 have longer distances to hike.Villages in Bamiyan exemplify how climate change can hamper the ability of families to sustain themselves. According to Prince Zaher, they show why global warming should be taken as seriously as fighting insurgents. ※Terrorism is not going to be lingering here for ever,§ he says. ※But climate change is an ongoing death sentence.§ This article was amended on 30 August 2017. An earlier version said Bamiyan was the ※epicentre§ of the region＊s environmental problems. Bamiyan is one of the places most at risk, but also the source of environmental problems elsewhere."																																																			
" went camping on the Norfolk coast?for free last week. I stoked a fire and , thanks to a generous friend who let?my group stay in his garden. It was?magical.Another group of campers were made to feel less welcome in . Wherever they pitched up, they were turned away. If they tried to get a drink, the pubs mysteriously closed. When I asked why the beach car park was shut, a parking attendant swelled with self-importance. ※We＊re in lockdown,§ he said. ※There＊s a group?of Travellers around.§These Irish Travellers  to the Roman Catholic shrine in Little Walsingham on 15 August. Normally, they stop on waste ground in Great Yarmouth, considered a tolerant place, not least because former travelling families own some seafront attractions. But this waste ground has been developed, and so last weekend the Travellers pitched their camp of 30 vehicles on a car park in Cromer. This seaside town was then  after antisocial behaviour and shoplifting. Shops and pubs closed by 7pm, and the desolate town was likened to  on what should have been the busiest Saturday night of the year.This story conforms to a racist stereotype, that Travellers are thieving troublemakers. I＊ve spoken to Cromer shopkeepers and they are not lying when they report thefts; nor is it likely that they are confused over the troublemakers＊ identity. Unfortunately, a small number of Travellers caused a small amount of trouble. To blame the Travellers for all the disruption is ※disproportionate§, according to Norfolk＊s police＊s deputy chief constable.Despite growing tolerance in most spheres, modern Britain is permanently locked down against a minority that wishes to live in a slightly different way. Travellers have been moved on for decades but in an era of preposterous land prices, there is less physical space than ever to accommodate them. Camping is thriving, but only the kind that makes landowners money. The settled community says everyone should play by the rules but , a Gypsy and Traveller advocate, tells me that whenever she arrives at a paying campsite in her traditional caravan, she is turned away. How does it feel to be constantly refused service, or find bars mysteriously closing early? If I was repeatedly thwarted by ※the rules§, I＊d want to break them. I suspect most of us would be the same.Travellers get away with it, residents complain. But so do middle-class law-breakers. I joined their ranks this holiday when my family became trapped after a dual carriageway was closed. With the traffic jam not forecast to clear for hours, I helped a dozen cars escape down a grass verge?and on to a tractor track across a field. When I followed, my car was halted by an irate farmer. He explained that if 100 vehicles did this, his temporary track would turn concrete-hard and couldn＊t be cultivated next year. I apologised profusely, and he allowed me to complete my trespass. I saved my children from being stuck for four hours but was reminded that sticking to the rules becomes inescapable as our nation becomes ever more densely populated.A second confession of antisocial behaviour concerns the animal : caterpillars. It is joyous to watch caterpillars transform into butterflies. Neighbouring gardeners will feel less delighted after we reared and released eight large whites. These cabbage-devouring pests test the tolerance of . But, like much human behaviour, these beautiful butterflies are only offensive in?a swarm.

"One morning in late March, Brij Khandelwal called the Agra police to report an attempted murder.Days before, the high court in India＊s Uttarakhand state had issued a landmark judgment declaring the Yamuna river 每 and another of India＊s holiest waterways, the Ganges 每 ※living entities§.Khandelwal, an activist, followed the logic. ※Scientifically speaking, the Yamuna is ecologically dead,§ he says. His police report named a series of government officials he wanted charged with attempted poisoning. ※If the river is dead, someone has to be responsible for killing it.§In the 16th century, Babur, the first Mughal emperor, described the waters of the Yamuna as ※better than nectar§. One of his successors built India＊s most famous monument, the Taj Mahal, on its banks. For the first 250 miles (400km) of its life, starting in the lower Himalayas, the river glistens blue and teems with life. And then it reaches Delhi.In India＊s crowded capital, the entire Yamuna is siphoned off for human and industrial use, and replenished with toxic chemicals and sewage from more than 20 drains. Those who enter the water emerge caked in dark, glutinous sludge. For vast stretches only the most resilient bacteria survive. The waterway that has sustained civilisation in Delhi for at least 3,000 years 每 and the sole source of water for more than 60 million Indians today 每 has in the past decades become one of the dirtiest rivers on the planet.※We have water records which show that, until the 1960s, the river was much better quality,§ says Himanshu Thakkar, an engineer who coordinates the South Asia Network on Dams,  and People, a network of rights groups. ※There was much greater biodiversity. Fish were still being caught.§What happened next mirrors a larger Indian story, particularly since the country＊s markets were unshackled in the early 1990s: one of runaway economic growth fuelled by vast, unchecked migration into cities; and the metastasising of polluting industries that have soiled many of India＊s waterways and made its air the most toxic in the world.In Delhi, the population has doubled since 1991. More than a quarter of its residents 每 up to 5 million people 每 live in illegal or unplanned settlements, their waste flowing directly into open sewers. Twenty-two drains gush industrial effluent into the river, while the streams and rivulets that are supposed to feed in rainwater have long since been eroded or choked off by rubbish.※We decreased the freshwater supply, and increased the polluted water supply,§ says Thakkar. ※You don＊t have to be a rocket scientist to predict what would happen.§The damage is most stark at Wazirabad, just inside the Delhi borders, where the river meets a barrage and comes to a sudden halt. On the other side, a major drain dumps nearly 500m gallons of sewage into the riverbed each day. Dissolved oxygen levels in the water drop from about 13mg per litre to zero.Animal life cannot survive in these conditions, but human life on the riverbank is ceaseless: men and women immerse themselves in rituals, bathe, and scrub hard at clothing and sheets. Some, like Sikander Sheikh, make their living off the pollution. The Bengali, who says he is 95, operates a tiny float on the river, lifting refuse from the surface that he sells on the weekend for a few dozen rupees. ※I can＊t do any other work,§ he says. ※To do agricultural work, you need eyes. Mine are weak. In this work, I slowly float around all day looking for what I can sell.§He lives on the banks of the river, in a hut he built himself, adorned with bric-a-brac fished from the water. Bouts of illness are frequent. ※I＊ll go to the doctor, I＊ll take medicines and then I＊ll get better and again, I＊ll come back and work.§Further up the Yamuna, near the city of Agra, residents in Patti Pachgai village complain of an epidemic of bone deformities and fluoride poisoning. ※The doctor has told me it＊s the water,§ says Tan Singh, who became ill five years ago and never recovered. ※I can＊t breathe much. When I inhale I feel stiff, my ribs ache. I can＊t sit, move around, nothing,§ the 40-year-old says.A 2015 study showed towns within 2km (1.25 miles) of the Yamuna all showed at least four times the permissible level of fluoride in the water. Officials blame the millions of gallons of untreated sewage pumped into the Yamuna, which they say is . ※The doctor has said to stop drinking this water and has suggested we buy bottles of filtered water,§ Singh says. ※Every time, how can we buy and drink it? It＊s too expensive.§In Mathura, another town along the river, thousands of Hindu devotees gather each year to mark the day they believe the goddess Yamuna appeared on earth.They bathe in the river and drink from it, the ecstasy obvious on many faces. Few are dissuaded by the sight of the water. ※Yes, the Yamuna is polluted, but it has the power to liberate us,§ says one priest. ※If you bathe in the Yamuna you will not go to hell.§Jasminbhai travelled from Mumbai for the occasion. ※There＊s no dirty water in the Yamuna,§ he insists. ※People who believe that, I would say they are lying.§India＊s supreme court heard in February that 2,000 crore rupees (?240m) had been spent on  since 1985. ※Delhi doesn＊t have a lack of money,§ says Thakkar. ※It also has the highest sewage capacity treatment in the country. Nor is there a lack of attention from either political, judicial, or media quarters.§The problem, he says, is that time and money are being invested in a dysfunctional system. Twenty state and federal government bodies squabble for control over different elements of the river. Ironically, for all that official attention, basic governance structures are still inadequate.A plan to clean India＊s largest river, the Ganges, spearheaded by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, is  for lack of effective governance.※If you install new sewage treatment plants, you also need a system in place to ensure they will function,§ Thakkar says. He wants an independent board to oversee the river, one that can question officials and constantly review the clean-up. ※At the moment, nobody really knows how the treatment plants function. And if they don＊t function, there are no corrective measures. Nothing happens.§The decision to grant living entity status to the river this year was met with fanfare, but will do little to improve its state, says Ritwick Dutta, a Delhi-based environmental lawyer.The court granted the Yamuna certain rights, but gave legal guardianship to senior members of the state bureaucracy. Dutta says that represents a clear conflict of interest. ※If a hydropower project comes up for consideration, whose side will the bureaucrat take? The river＊s or the government＊s?※It＊s got symbolic value,§ he says of the decision. ※But in reality, it may not mean much.§Soon, it may mean nothing at all: on Friday, India＊s supreme court suspended the decision to grant the Yamuna and Ganges living status. The Uttarakhand state government wants the decision scrapped altogether, arguing that legal rights for river makes it unclear who is liable for damages from floods, among other issues. A full hearing on the matter is pending. The latest plan to clean the Yamuna, hatched two years ago by the Delhi government, does contain something novel. Rather than simply building more sewage plants, the scheme aims to reactivate the riverbank, including by building bike paths, low-cost housing, schools and parks.It is the brainchild of a team lead by Pankaj Vir Gupta, a professor of architecture at the University of Virginia, who sees in the Yamuna＊s dark reflection a deeper malaise, originating in India＊s colonial past.※One hundred years ago, the Yamuna was the front facade of the Mughal city of Delhi,§ he says. ※It was the face of significant monuments like , the Red Fort. It was the mirror to the city.※Even as recently as 50 years ago, there were carts on the river,§ he says. ※There was active participation by the people of Delhi, who went fishing, boating, and for recreational walks.§Gupta says the problem started with the British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, who in the 1920s designed New Delhi, the city＊s southern quarter, a European-inspired capital of wide boulevards, manicured gardens and stately government buildings.The Yamuna, a temperamental waterway that subsides in the dry season, before swelling dramatically during the monsoon, did not fit the British planners＊ rigidly ordered worldview, he says. ※Anything that was informal, ecologically, was not really part of the imperial plan for British .§Unlike past iterations of the city, New Delhi was built without the Yamuna at its centre. ※That started the unravelling of the relationship between city and river,§ Gupta says. ※It took something that was central to the livelihood and cultural and ritual experience of the citizenry and made it into a negative space.※You could argue the pollution problem is really a perception problem. The minute you remove something, ontologically, from the centre of the city, its meaningfulness and significance goes away.§Thakkar suspects the river＊s condition will need to worsen before it improves. ※Look at the Thames of London,§ he says. ※It was dirty until the smell of the river reached parliament and the politicians couldn＊t bear the stink.※We have not yet reached the stage where the stink of the Yamuna has reached parliament. Possibly it never will 每 it＊s an air-conditioned environment. But if it manages to reach even the parliament＊s gates, then finally we might see something.§"

"ach of the three mining machines outweighs the 200-ton blue whale 每 the largest animal the world has ever known 每 and they look fearsome, especially the bulk-cutter designed to grind up the ocean floor with its enormous roller, covered in spikes.If all goes as planned, come 2019 these giant remote-controlled robots will steamroll across the bottom of the Bismarck Sea off the coast of Papua New Guinea, chewing it up in pursuit of rich copper and gold reserves for a Canadian company called Nautilus Minerals. Nautilus chief executive Michael Johnston is anxious to demonstrate something besides making handsome profits. He also wants to show that his company has designed the mining expedition to have a small environmental footprint, especially when to the land-based counterpart.※People have a view of mining, and they think we＊re going to transport that view into the ocean, and it＊s going to be ugly,§ says Johnston, a soft-spoken New Zealand native and a 30-year veteran of mining.※It＊s important to all of us, especially those of us who＊ve worked in mining for a number of years, to show people that you can do it better. I think a lot of people will be surprised,§ says Johnson, 54, who joined Nautilus in 2006.Johnston will have a lot to prove. The project, Solwara-1, will be the first ever attempt to extract minerals from the deep sea, and with the world watching closely.Deep sea mining presents an ethical conundrum and an opportunity to avoid the costly environmental and social mistakes of land-based mining. That has prompted a group of policymakers, businesses and academic researchers to design rules that they hope will minimize environmental harm. They have proposed ideas that range from setting aside no-mining zones within a region rich in minerals to using technology that will reduce the extent of sediment plumes during dredging.※We have the opportunity from the very beginning to understand the science, to understand the impact and to understand how to ameliorate the impacts,§ says Dr James Hein, a senior scientist with the US Geological Survey. ※This will really be the first time we can approach it from step one.§But whether any of those ideas will work as designed to reduce environmental impact won＊t be known until the machines are put to work. Some of Nautilus＊s proposals, such as relocating some of the wildlife temporary to another location during mineral extraction 每 and recolonizing the spot afterward 每 attract strong skepticism.※Nautilus＊s claims that they can simply relocate parts of the site＊s ecosystem elsewhere don＊t stand up to scientific scrutiny, and the effectiveness of any measures to reduce other impacts will be difficult, if not impossible, to verify independently,§ says Dr David Santillo, senior scientist at Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter in the UK.The deep ocean plays a critical role in the Earth＊s biosphere 每 it regulates global temperatures, stores carbon and provides habitat for a huge array of creatures. Scientists and environmental advocates fear that mining this pitch black, frigid world will not only kill any marine life that gets in the way of the machines but could potentially devastate far wider areas by stirring up plumes of sediment and introducing chemical, noise and light pollution.Their worries underpin a sentiment that deep-sea mining appears inevitable. Demand for minerals to make virtually everything we use, including the phones and computers that run our lives, will only increase. Even technology that promises to cut our oil addiction and reduce emissions requires a reliable supply of raw materials, from to lithium for electric vehicle batteries.The vast treasure of untouched resources on the ocean floor 每 copper, zinc, cobalt, manganese, titanium and other minerals 每 has tantalized mining companies around the globe.The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) is a particularly a coveted mining area that＊s roughly the size of the continental US and lies between Mexico and Hawaii. It contains potato-sized nodules of manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper and molybdenum worth roughly $25.2tn, according to Hein＊s calculations. Not all of this amount would be economically recoverable, Hein says, but even 30% would equal $7.56tn.Moreover, these minerals exist at much higher grades than on land, where supplies that are easily accessible have mostly been depleted and mining companies are blowing the tops off mountains, cutting down wider expanses of forests and digging ever-bigger holes to extract from harder-to-reach deposits. copper in the Andes, which produces about 40% of the world＊s supply, would require the removal of 50 tons of barren rock to get to a 20 million ton ore deposit with 0.5% copper in it, Hein says. In a marine environment, you can find a 7% copper deposit sitting right on the seafloor.Of the 28 exploratory contracts signed with the International Seabed Authority, which regulates undersea mining in international waters, 16 are for mining in the CCZ. The US hasn＊t ratified the treaty and joined the ISA. US aerospace and defense firm Lockheed Martin has obtained two exploratory contracts through its British subsidiary UK Seabed Resources.Deep-sea mining is an expensive undertaking. Nautilus has encountered delays for its roughly $480m project and still needs to raise $150m to $250m to move ahead.Around the world, extensive work is now going into mapping ocean floor ecosystems and researching ways to mitigate the environmental impact of deep-sea mining. In the US, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has done exploratory and mapping work off the coast of Hawaii, along with projects by university researchers.The European Union has contributed millions of dollars to organizations such as MIDAS (Managing Impacts of Deep-Sea Resource Exploitation), and Blue , an international consortium of 19 industry and research organizations.A UK-funded expedition conducted the first ever controlled deep-sea sediment plume experiment in the Atlantic last year, about 300 miles from the Canary Islands. Sediment plumes are big dust clouds kicked up by mineral extraction, and scientists worry that the plumes could travel great distances, choking sea life along the way.※There＊s a lot more research to be done on sediment plumes,§ says Dr Bramley Murton, who led the expedition and heads the marine mineral research at the UK＊s National Oceanography Center. ※But we got some data and, at the moment, the initial indication is that we can＊t see the plume from a kilometer, or roughly 0.6 miles, away.§ That＊s an encouraging result, because scientists previously suspected that sediment plumes would travel much further.Another way to minimize impact is to aside protected areas within mining zones. Back in 2013, a team of scientists led by Dr Craig Smith, a professor of oceanography in University of Hawaii＊s M芋noa＊s School of Ocean and Earth Sciences and Technology, recommended the ISA to designate roughly a quarter of the CCZ as a protected area. The ISA accepted the team＊s recommendations provisionally but will need to decide whether to include them in the final rules, which could take three to five years to finalize.Improving the precision of mining robots will also help to reduce environmental disturbances. Companies with the technology that could solve the problem include the Seattle-based, which has developed software that enables a robot to recalibrate its aim and movement to improve precision by learning from each trip it makes to the seabed.※We use machine learning software to identify and track objects in real time, with high resolution situational awareness, so it can see through sediment or oil spills,§ says Don Pickering, BluHaptics＊ CEO.At the Solwara-1 site, 25km off the Papua New Guinea coast, Nautilus plans to launch its project from a ship 230 meters long and 40 meters wide, with roughly 130 employees on it. The company will go after minerals born 1,000每3,000 meters deep in volcanically active zones, around vents that spurt super hot, acidic water containing metals dissolved from the earth＊s crust. The active vents are populated by numerous species, including tubeworms, clams, snails, shrimp, crabs and many .The three Nautilus robots, designed by UK-based SMD, will be lowered into the water, break up the rocks and collect them to be piped back to the vessel.The ore will then be transported by smaller boats to China and sold to the Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Holding Co. The ship plans to remain at the first project site for roughly three years, bringing up 2.5 million metric tons of ore containing metals worth roughly $1.5bn, give or take shifts in commodity prices.To address sediment plumes, SMD designed the robots to suck the plume into the slurry with the ore and pump it up into the vessel. ※Our ultimate goal is to recover as much of the material as possible, not to blow it away,§ Johnston says.Using a steel riser and pump system designed by GE Oil & Gas, once the ore is dropped into the vessel, the icy water will be pumped back down to the sea floor so it doesn＊t mix with the warmer surface water and potentially cause algae blooms and other environmental disturbances. To minimize the use of bright light, which could disrupt marine life in the pitch black world, Nautilus will use sonar and digital cameras to create 3D maps to guide its extraction with the remotely operated robots.※These populations grow fast and they reproduce a lot, so in some sense one can argue that they might recover quickly. But the environmental issue is that these habitats are relatively rare on the sea floor, and they＊re different from one site to the next because the animals have adapted to the fluid chemistries,§ says Dr Cindy Lee Van Dover, director of the Duke University Marine Laboratory in North Carolina and a member of the Deep-Ocean Stewardship Initiative, an international group of scientists, lawyers and advocates that makes environmental recommendations to the ISA.※We aren＊t talking about stopping mining, just thinking about how to do it well. We can map these environments to show where the highest density of animals is and avoid those high-density places. That＊s a very rational approach,§ says Van Dover. ※I＊m reasonably optimistic that we can come up with progressive environmental regulations.§"

Wang said this should drive an increased urgency in cutting both air pollution and the carbon emissions that cause global warming.※When you look at haze reduction, it is not just about reducing emissions of air pollutants, it is also about reducing emissions of greenhouses gases from China and all the other countries in the world, so we can possibly slow down the rapidly changing Arctic climate,§ Wang said.The emissions of greenhouse gases from  in the Arctic since the late 1970s, according to recent research.

Instead, hundreds of reproductive males and females (drones and ※princesses§) emerge from the nest 每 hence flying ant day.Basically: maximising genetic mixing, minimising losses to predators, and overcoming low probability of success. All ensure survival and dispersal of the species.Genetic mixing is enhanced by virgin queens and drones first scattering. This is to maximise the chance of mating between different colonies to reduce inbreeding 每 something commented on by . (Remember that all the colony ants were produced by one queen, so have high genetic similarity.)After dispersing, the ※princesses§ release pheromones to attract drones, but often play hard to get 每 they fly to escape converging males, allowing only the fastest and fittest to mate.Mass emergence does provide a rich food source, which can attract predators. However, massed prey benefit from , which reduces the likelihood of any one organism being eaten. If they present in small numbers they are more vulnerable, since this can train the predators, who will remain in the area. This is why other insects, , behave in the same way.Even so, each potential queen has little chance of success. During its lifetime a large ant colony can disperse thousands of princesses, but on average only one will succeed. Which is probably just as well 每 otherwise, there would be very rapid growth in the number of ant colonies. Many succumb to predators: birds, dragonflies, often other ants, or die from starvation or environmental hazards. The first brood may fail, and the young colony can die out. Collectively, these mortality factors impose strong selection that ensures the queen has maximum fitness to produce the next generation. She also has to be lucky.And what of the drones? Mating occurs in flight or on the ground, and since a queen usually mates with several males, this increases her offspring＊s genetic diversity. The queen keeps a  in an abdominal structure called a spermatheca, from which hundreds of thousands of eggs are fertilised. The drones, meanwhile, die in a day or two.At the end of the nuptial flight, the fertilised queens land, chew off their wings and start a new colony, where 每 if successful 每 they will stay for the rest of their lives.But how do queen ants live for so long?  queens can live for more than 25 years 每 and understanding why has interested researchers looking into the causes of ageing. There are well catalogued environmental , including a protected environment and a secure food supply without the risks of hunting, but it was recently reported that queens have a higher expression of those genes necessary for repair of  than genetically identical workers.It＊s fertile ground for further research from under a crack in the paving stones."																																																			
"s America and the world attempt to fathom , most of us are blaming Donald Trump. On one level this is obviously correct. During the presidential election campaign, Trump pledged, if elected, to pull the US out of the accord; he has now made good on that pledge. Withdrawal from the Paris agreement is also consistent with his belligerent personality and isolationist approach to foreign policy. Yet there is a larger context that needs to be understood if we are to find a way forward.The fact is, Republicans have been resisting action on climate change for just about as long as scientists have been asking the world to do something about it. In 1992, George HW Bush signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), pledging to translate the written document into ※concrete action to protect the planet§.He did this 每 along with other world leaders 每 because the scientific community had already made clear that anthropogenic interference in the climate system represented a serious threat to our future health, wellbeing and prosperity. But even before Bush went to Rio, members of his own administration were objecting. The White House chief of staff, John Sununu, circulated a contrarian report that insisted 每 contrary to the emerging scientific consensus 每 that any observed warming was entirely natural, caused by the sun. Shortly thereafter, Bush lost his bid for re-election, and Democrat Bill Clinton took office. Clinton did not particularly care about climate change, but his smart and articulate vice-president, Al Gore, did. As Gore made climate change an issue, and proposed the adoption of a carbon pricing system (a ※BTU tax§), Republican opposition began to harden. Even while acknowledging that economists considered an energy tax to be most economically efficient means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they insisted (without evidence) that it would hamstring the economy and destroy jobs. In fairness, Democrats did not rally around the carbon tax, but neither did they reject the scientific evidence that climate change was a real problem. Conservative and libertarian thinktanks with close links to the Republican party, however, did. They promoted the rejection of climate science, insisting (again without evidence) that the science was unsettled and that if climate change turned out to be a real issue, we could simply adapt. They also launched highly personal attacks on climate scientists. Meanwhile, the Conference of Parties had formulated a market-based approach to climate change as the basis for the Kyoto protocol to the UNFCCC. Emissions trading was a conservative idea 每 create carbon markets and let the private sector determine how best to allocate carbon assets. It had been successfully implemented in the US to combat acid rain in the midwest and air pollution in California, with no discernible harm to the American economy. It offered a meaningful alternative to top-heavy command and control approaches. So one might have expected Republicans to have accepted the Kyoto framework. They did not. When George W Bush came to office in 2001, he announced that he would reject the Kyoto protocol, and few members of his party criticized that decision. For the next eight years, both the president and his fellow Republicans in Congress continued to cast doubt on whether manmade climate change was even real. The Bush administration opposition to action was so entrenched that in 2007, 12 US states brought suit in federal court in an attempt to force the administration to act. The US supreme court agreed that the federal government was out of compliance with the Clean Air Act and ordered the EPA to develop a plan to control carbon dioxide emissions. The Clean Power Plan, developed during the Obama administration, was the response. And while Donald Trump came to office pledging to withdraw it,  candidate in the 2016 Republican primary opposed it. Ted Cruz went so far as to call it ※unconstitutional§, even though the supreme court had ordered it. And, with the exception of John Kasich, every Republican candidate in one way or another denied the reality or significance of manmade climate change. While their exact positions varied, not one of the major Republican candidates pledged to combat climate change. One might suppose that this Republican intransigence reflected the views of Republican voters, but polls show this is not the case. Just last week, the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication released new data showing that a majority of Republicans in  state support American participation in the Paris accord. Yet even as these new data were being released, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and 21 other Republican senators were urging Trump to withdraw from Paris 每 which, of course, he did. There＊s a saying in business: fix the problem, not the blame. It＊s a nice concept, but you can＊t fix a problem if you don＊t know its cause. And just as the scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change is clear, the historical evidence of opposition to action is also clear: the greatest obstacle to American action on climate change for the past 20 years has been the Republican party, and this opposition has proven itself to be impervious to argument, even from what one might think would be trusted sources. American business and religious leaders, distinguished senior Republicans who served in the Nixon and first Bush administrations, and even the Pentagon have called for action on climate change. But it has had no impact on Republican policies. This conclusion is hard for some to accept, particularly for scientists, as it seems overtly partisan. (And it may seem unfair to the few, courageous Republicans who have spoken out on the issue.) But as scientists have called upon us to accept the reality of climate change, we must accept the reality that American climate change denial is not bipartisan. It is Republican. And the only way to fix it is to change the Republican party, or to vote Republicans out of office. "																																																			
"A search of hundreds of beaches across the UK has found almost three-quarters of them are littered with tiny plastic pellets.The lentil-size pellets known as ※nurdles§ are used as a raw material by industry to make new plastic products. But searches of 279 shorelines from Shetland to Scilly revealed that 205 (73%) contained pellets. The largest number recorded in the  weekend in early February were found at Widemouth Bay in Cornwall, where 33 volunteers from the Widemouth Task Force collected about 127,500 pellets on a 100-metre stretch of beach. Thousands of the tiny pellets were spotted by volunteers over a short period in locations from Porth Neigwl in Wales to the shoreline in front of the dunes at Seaton Carew near Hartlepool, County Durham, and after stormy conditions on the Isle of Wight. More than 600 volunteers took part in the hunt organised by Fidra, the Scottish environmental charity, in collaboration with the Environmental Investigation Agency, Fauna and Flora International, Greenpeace, the Marine Conservation Society and Surfers Against Sewage. The lightweight nurdles can escape into the environment at various points during their manufacture, transport or use, spilling into rivers and oceans or getting into drains where they are washed out to sea. It is thought that billions are lost in the UK each year. Nurdles are one of the main sources of primary microplastics 每 small pieces of plastic that have not come from larger items broken down into little bits 每 in European seas and can cause damage to wildlife. Experts say they soak up chemical pollutants from their surroundings and then release the toxins into the animals, such as birds and fish, that eat them. Results from the hunt will be fed into the government＊s consultation on , which is looking at ways of tackling the problem. Madeleine Berg, projects officer at Fidra, said she was delighted so many nurdle hunters braved the winter weather to take part.※The information we＊ve gathered will be vital to show the government that pellets are found on beaches all around the UK and, importantly, that so many people care about the issue. ※Simple precautionary measures can help spillages and ensure nurdles do not end up in our environment. We are asking the government to ensure best practice is in place along the full plastic supply chain, and any further nurdle pollution is stopped.§Fidra has been working with the UK plastics industry since 2012 to promote best practice to end further pellet pollution.

"t might be best known for its wildlife, but  is facing a growing number of environmental concerns and biodiversity in the country is under threat.Rapid deforestation means more than 370,000 hectares of forest are  for charcoal, firewood and lumber without a clear plan for reforestation. Habitats are being lost and desertification has increased, with severe consequences not only for wildlife but also the health and livelihoods of farming communities living in rural parts of the country. More than three quarters of Tanzania＊s population live at subsistence level, relying on crop growth and seasonal rainfall to survive. Agriculture accounts for a quarter of the Tanzanian economy, but it is these farmers who suffer the real, dangerous consequences of environmental degradation.In late 2016, a group of us decided to take on the issue with the #50MillionTrees campaign, which aimed to encourage localpeople to reverse the loss of their natural environment. We realised that if every one of the 50 million people living in Tanzania could be inspired to take a single action, like planting just one tree, we would gain far more than just 50 million more trees. As well as raising awareness about environmental issues, we could promote sustainability and encourage the idea that everyone can make a difference when it comes to climate change. What #50MillionTrees is trying to show is how individual actions and small changes in behaviour can make a big difference, both in a single country and globally. The idea is to inspire, educate and mobilise the population of Tanzania. We set up the 50MillionTrees hashtag to generate some interest online and the society now has more than 1,000 young members, all former volunteers of sustainable development charity . We are part of a wider environmental initiative, , which supports youth-led social and environmental action and advocacy in Tanzania, and contributes to the achievement of the UN global goals for sustainable development.Social media played a big part in raising awareness and getting people involved. So far the group has reached around 150,000 people online. But we also knew that to make this work we needed to connect at the grassroots community level, so we have held more than 50 public awareness raising events across Tanzania, involving another 10,000 people.Of those 10,000, three quarters have been school children. Reaching out to other young Tanzanians was crucial if the campaign was to be successful in the long run. We must inspire people from a young age to take action and care for the environment 每 they need to know about everything we get from nature.  can then tell their parents and others what they have learnt and how to act.As part of our initiative groups of schoolchildren in the north of the country decide to plant fruit trees. The idea is that the orchards serve many purposes, including as outdoor classrooms which will give children the opportunity to watch and learn about their environment in a practical, hands-on and exciting way.We have also held two youth  to raise awareness of the green growth agenda in Tanzania. These were attended by representatives from the Tanzanian government, including the ministry responsible for the environment, and gave young people the opportunity to engage with decision makers about green growth policy, deforestation and sustainable resource management.Following the first conference, the government announced a policy that will see every student in the country plant a tree while at school. We really did not expect to achieve so much so soon, but the group has since been invited to meet with the environment minister to discuss further how we can work with government.Young people are more important than ever in taking actions that inspire other citizens to contribute to the kind of future we all want to see. Our campaign has shown that young volunteers can make a difference if we work together to make our voices heard. If enough of us do that, people listen and change happens."																																																			
"There＊s no sunlight four kilometres below the waves but there is light.It comes from a sea cucumber that emits a faint glow from its sticky skin, attracting fish and crabs that try to take bites out of its side. The skin is both a lure and a trap, marking incautious predators with a sticky glowing dot, an ※eat me§ sign to any passing larger predators.It comes from the anglerfish, winking their lures on and off to attract prey in the inky darkness, and the sea stars, which emit bursts of light to ward off predators.In the absolute darkness there are busts of colour, the blues and greens of an alien landscape, where as many as 80% of organisms have some capacity for bioluminescence.Until recently, no scientists had explored these depths on the Australian coastline.On Friday, the CSIRO research vessel Investigator docked in Brisbane at the end of a 31-day voyage from Tasmania to the Coral Sea, mapping the seafloor, collecting specimens and trawling for rubbish the whole way.Its hold was a wunderkammer of gelatinous fish and spiny crabs, scarlet sea-spiders, nightmarish cookie cutter sharks and bioluminescent invertebrates. One of the passengers, the fleshy, , has already made international headlines.More than 1,000 different species were collected, at least a third of which were new to science.Of 200 organisms tested in a dark lab by J谷r?me Mallefet, an international bioluminescent expert and researcher at the National Science Foundation in Belgium, just over half showed some kind of bioluminescent response. That＊s a conservative estimate, Mallefet said. The 4km journey to the surface in a metal box was not a kind one and many specimens died before reaching the surface. While some exhibited a posthumous response, Mallefet said, it＊s unknown how many others might have glowed when they were alive.※Here what I have seen is the response they give me on the surface,§ Mallefet said. ※But we really have no idea of the functioning of bioluminescence down there. In these really deep waters we don＊t know nearly anything about them.§Some creatures were collected by the sampling box on the way up from the sea floor. Among them was a cookie cutter shark, a species that can live anywhere from 200m to 3km below the surface but is often found in an area known as the twilight zone, 1km below, the deepest point that sunlight can reach.The cookie cutter shark also glows.※If you are in the twilight zone, you are able to be seen from below as a shadow,§ Mallefet said. ※But if you emit light from your belly at the same colour as the light above you, you become invisible.§The RV Investigator left Hobart on 16 May and travelled up the edge of the continental shelf. The ship is equipped with state-of-the-art sonar equipment, which captured a 12km wide swathe of the ocean floor, providing the first accurate picture of the seafloor off the Australian coastline.The mapping technology is never turned off while the ship is in motion and research crews are instructed to try and avoid sailing over the same patch of ocean twice, to add to the ocean floor data collected by the CSIRO.※On the seafloor there are mountains and valleys and crevasses and canyons 每 it＊s really rugged down there,§ Dr Tim O＊Hara said.O＊Hara is the senior curator of marine invertebrates at Museums Victoria and was the chief scientist on the expedition, heading up a team of 27 scientists, 13 technicians and 20 crew from seven countries.He said previous mapping of the seafloor along the Australian coast assumed it was more featureless. The rugged terrain made for difficult sampling. A metal box, known as a sled, was lowered and dragged along the seafloor before being brought up, collecting other creatures and often rubbish on the way.※I don＊t think there has been a single sled load that we have done that hasn＊t brought up a bit of rubbish,§ O＊Hara said.The most exciting finds, O＊Hara said, had been the wide array of deep-sea fish that look like Pixar concept art.There were the lizard and dragon fish, with an ※amazing variety variety of teeth§, the faceless fish that O＊Hara said had ※such an enigmatic face§ despite eponymously not having a face at all, what appeared to be a new species of blobfish, recovered off the coast of Tasmania, a bright red coffinfish and a new species of anglerfish.Many of them were decidedly blobby.※In the deep sea it doesn＊t pay to have a lot of muscle because there＊s so little food down there,§ O＊Hara said. ※It is much better to have a jelly-like body and just wait on the seafloor for prey.§The expedition also collected a shortarse feelerfish, a species discovered in New Zealand and named for the unusual and potentially unwise close proximity of its anus to its mouth. It was only the second specimen found in Australian waters. On a whale skull they found a number of zombie worms, mouthless fleshy tubes that hang around until bacteria has broken down the bone marrow and suck up the resulting soup. ※It＊s an extraordinary lifestyle,§ O＊Hara said. Taxonomists will now sort through the specimens to describe and name any new species.A selection will go on display at a temporary exhibit at Melbourne Museum later this year."																																																			
" problem that cannot be seen is one that politicians will generally choose to ignore. That natural human tendency is dangerously short-sighted. When it comes to  it is literally lethal. Scientists and environmental campaigners have been warning about a build-up of toxins in the atmosphere over British cities for years. Yet?only when the filth forms a visible haze,?when people are advised to stay indoors because outdoor respiration is palpably harming their health, does the issue register on many political radars.The smogs of the early 1950s were unignorable, not just because they could be seen but because they were obvious killers. Thousands died when an especially noxious cloud settled over the capital in 1952. The resulting domestic and industrial coal-burning. Hundreds of thousands are directly affected by equivalent scourges today 每 particulate emissions, nitrous and sulphurous compounds, mostly belched from cars. Children and the elderly are most at risk; minority ethnic and deprived communities ; but no one is immune.

The air we breathe is an indivisible shared resource that can only be protected by collective action.That upsets those conservatives who hate the idea of government acting on behalf of society as a whole in ways that curtail any individual freedom 每 even the freedom to pollute. But the facts can overcome even the most stubborn denial. Today＊s campaigning calls for action will eventually become a consensus. London＊s mayor Sadiq Khan is in the political vanguard. His calls for a Treasury scheme  to cleaner models has obvious merits. So do ultra-low emission zone regulations in town centres and positive incentives, such as cheaper parking, for electric vehicles. But those are tactical measures when the challenge is strategic 每 a policy shift towards clean, public transport that works well enough to make individual car journeys less essential.None of this will happen without a commitment from government to cleaner air, underpinned by statute, including targets that trigger sanctions in the breach. The  might soon lose the authority to rebuke Britain for allowing our air to be foul, but the duty and power to clean it up has always been a matter for Westminster. The moment to take that responsibility more seriously is long overdue."																																																			
"※The air pollution problem in Poland is beyond any western standards.

"Oslo will  from the road for at least two days this week to combat rising air pollution, angering some motorists after they were urged to buy diesel cars a few years ago.The ban will go into effect on Tuesday on municipal roads but will not apply on the national motorways that criss-cross the Norwegian capital. Better atmospheric conditions are expected on Thursday. Motorists violating the ban will be fined 1,500 kroner (?174).This is the first time Oslo has implemented a ban of this type after the city council 每 made up of the Labour and Greens parties 每 agreed in principle in February 2016 on the use of such a measure.While diesel cars emit less CO2 they emit more nitrogen dioxyde.※In Oslo, we can＊t ask children, the elderly, and those suffering from respiratory problems to remain holed up at home because the air is too dangerous to breathe,§ a Greens city councillor Lan Marie Nguyen Berg said.The measure has angered some motorists, who were encouraged in 2006 by Norwegian authorities to opt for diesel vehicles, which at the time were considered a better environmental choice than petrol-fuelled cars.※Make up your minds. It wasn＊t very long ago that diesel was recommended over petrol by Jens (Stoltenberg, Norway＊s former prime minister, now Nato＊s secretary general). Not sure you really know what is best,§ wrote an annoyed Irene Signora Maier Tziotas on the Facebook page of the newspaper Verdens Gang.Mazyar Keshvari, an MP from the populist right Progress Party, which is a member of the coalition government, urged motorists to seek compensation.※The biggest swindle of Norwegian motorists has now become a reality,§ he told the Norwegian broadcaster TV2. ※This was part of the red-green government＊s (Stoltenberg＊s coalition) ingenious climate measures※Not only did they recommend motorists to buy diesel cars, they also changed the taxes to make them less expensive.

"Not a single city in northern India meets international air quality standards, according to a  report that estimates air pollution kills more than 1 million Indians each year and takes 3% off the country＊s GDP.The  also shows that levels of the most dangerous airborne pollutants grew by 13% in India between 2010 and 2015 but fell at least 15% over the same period in China, the US and Europe.It adds to  showing the problem of toxic air is not limited only to the Indian capital, Delhi, but afflicts almost all the country＊s large cities, particularly in the north.Air quality data gathered for 2015 from state pollution control boards and under freedom of information laws showed ※there are virtually no places in India complying with World Health Organisation and , and most cities are critically polluted§, the report said.※Except for a few places in southern  which complied with NAAQ standards, the entire country is experiencing a public health crisis due to high air pollution levels.§The report added that ※deaths due to air pollution are only a fraction less than the number of deaths caused by tobacco usage§, citing the Lancet＊s  study, which shows about 3,283 Indians die each day due to exposure to outdoor air pollution.In all of the 20 cities monitored in the state of Uttar Pradesh, the level of PM10 每 airborne pollutants such as dust, mould and chemical droplets less than 10 micrometers in diameter 每 exceeded international limits by at least 100%.Ghaziabad, an Uttar Pradesh city that borders Delhi, exceeded the limits by more than 400%, the report showed.But the PM10 limits were also exceeded in cities where the problem is less publicised, such as Hyderabad, Pune and Thane, where pollution density was about twice the safe level.Cities in the south-western state of Karnataka generally enjoyed good air quality, with 12 of the 21 places with monitoring stations, including Mangalore and Mysore, recording PM10 levels well below the safe annual average limit of 60 micrograms.Delhi＊s average level of PM2.5, the smallest and most harmful pollutants, was 128 micrograms in 2015 compared with 81 micrograms  that year.Poor air quality is the result of several factors including road dust, open fires, vehicle exhaust fumes, industrial emissions and the burning of crop residue.This week, Delhi＊s high court directed administrators in Punjab, an agricultural northern state where crop burning each October sends torrents of smog billowing across north India, to cease the practice from this year. ※We are of the view that the air quality of Delhi and nearby states is already deteriorating day by day and has attained alarming proportions,§ the court said on Thursday.India＊s supreme court has also  from Delhi after last year＊s Diwali festival caused levels of some pollutants to reach 42 times the safe limit and , construction sites and a coal-fired power station."

"An air pollution alert has been issued for  residents due to a high level of ozone, already exceeding government standards for the entire year.The NSW Office of Environment and Heritage  for Sydney＊s metropolitan area on Tuesday as ※poor§, denoting a score of 100-149 on the Air Quality Index (AQI). ※Hazardous§ is classified as 200 and above.Ozone is an irritant secondary pollutant formed by chemical reactions between atmospheric gases and nitrogen oxides from car-vehicle exhausts on sunny days. The problem is exacerbated by lack of wind.As temperatures increase, so does ozone production, meaning it forms more readily in summer and reaches its highest concentrations in the afternoon or early evening.Matthew Riley, the director of climate and atmospheric science at OEH, said higher levels of ozone were not unusual in  over December and January.The national standards allowed for one day above the accepted ozone levels per year, to account for extreme events such as bushfires that can increase production, said Riley.Ozone levels exceeded that level in Richmond and St Marys in western Sydney late on Monday afternoon and could do so again on Tuesday or Wednesday, due to high temperatures and weak winds.As well as worsening existing respiratory conditions such as asthma, breathing in too much ozone could cause eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, as well as coughing and shortness of breath.NSW  advised sufferers to use their medication when necessary and, if symptoms worsened, to seek medical advice. The department＊s Dr Ben Scalley said parents should limit the time children with asthma play outside.※Ozone levels reach their peak around 7pm in the evening and tend to be lowest in the morning, so it＊s best to plan outdoor play in the morning when the day is cooler,§ he said.The alert coincides with a period of sweltering summer weather for Sydney and its surrounding regions. Temperatures were forecast to hit 31C in central Sydney on Tuesday. Residents of the western suburbs were expected to see a high of 37C.The Bureau of Meteorology forecast a high of 38C in the city on Wednesday, cooling on Thursday, then rising again to temperatures in the early 30s on Friday and Saturday.Richmond and Penrith were both forecast to reach 40C on Wednesday and 42C on Friday. Inland NSW would bear the brunt of the hot weather, with a heatwave at severe or extreme levels past 45C on Wednesday, the weather bureau said.The NSW Rural Fire Service has warned of a heightened risk of bushfires this week, and urged farmers to protect their properties by putting in firebreaks around paddocks and other assets."																																																			
"Beijing will create an environmental police force aimed at tackling deadly smog, after the Chinese capital spent the first week of 2017 mostly shrouded in a thick haze of pollution.The new law enforcement outfit will patrol the streets, eyes peeled for open-air barbecues, trash burning and dusty roads that violate regulations, the city＊s acting mayor Cai Qi said at the weekend. Beijing will also shut its last coal-fired power plant and  this year, Cai said according to state media. Officials will shut 500 factories and 300,000 older vehicles will be taken off the road.※There is still a long way to go to meet the expectation of the public,§ he added, admitting he wakes up every morning and checks the air quality, along with the weather report.The capital is frequently beset with toxic smog and levels of harmful air pollution in 2015 were more than eight times those recommended by the World Health Organization.  declared a ※war on pollution§ in 2014, but has struggled to deliver the sweeping change many had hoped to see and government inspections routinely find pollutions flouting the law. Last week, inspection teams from the environment ministry  despite a government ban, known as a ※red alert§, aimed at curbing smog. More than 500 construction sites and businesses and 10,000 vehicles violated measures to reduce air pollution.But Beijing＊s new police squad may do little to help residents breathe easy. Its focus on local, street-level sources of pollution ignores the steel factories and coal-fired power plants just outside the city limits in neighbouring Hebei province, or the more than 5m cars clogging the roads. Cars account for about 31% of the most harmful type of air pollution, according to China＊s environmental ministry. While officials are aware heavy industry and automobiles are the largest sources of pollution, the government has been reluctant to impose sweeping change for fear of economic repercussions and potential unrest from fired workers.※The root cause of the region＊s smog problems, from a long-term perspective, is an unclean industrial and energy mix, which requires big changes,§ said Chen Jining, China＊s environmental minister, adding that  about the toxic haze.Beijing education authorities did bow to public pressure last week, agreeing to install air purifiers in school classrooms after more than a year of campaigning by concerned parents. A  found acrid air is linked to at least one million deaths a year in China, and contributed to a third of all fatalities in major cities, on par with smoking. Another research paper said the smog had shortened life expectancies by five and a half years in parts of China."																																																			
"The mayor of , Anne Hidalgo, has unveiled plans to restrict traffic in the French capital and pedestrianise the city centre in an attempt to halve the number of private cars on the roads. comes as arguments continue over the  along the Seine last summer and other traffic reduction measures introduced after  led to a cloud of smog over the city. Hidalgo told the  she wanted to ※divide by around half the number of polluting private cars§ in Paris as part of her ongoing campaign to ※reconquer the public space§ for pedestrians, cyclists and other non-polluting transport, including electric cars and scooters.A 1km stretch of road along the river from Place de la Concorde and Pont Royal is scheduled for closure.City authorities also plan to restrict traffic on two main roads running from east to west: the upper highway on the right bank and the rue de Rivoli, on which City Hall is located.Hidalgo is planning a new electric tramway, increased bicycle lanes on busy roads and the pedestrianisation of central areas.She said urgent environmental concerns and the challenge of making the transition to clean transport were absolute priorities.※The deluge is imminent and we cannot wait for it to sweep us all away ＃ there are too many cars in Paris,§ she told those gathered for her traditional new year wishes on Friday.The mayor said from September 2018, an electric tram-bus 每 nicknamed the ※Olympic tramway§ in honour of Paris＊s bid for the 2024 Games 每 would run next to part of the upper highways along the Seine in both directions. The news will spark anger and dismay among Paris＊s motorists, and Hidalgo＊s political critics, who are already furious over the river highway closures.In the summer, two miles (3.3km) of highway from the Tuileries in the 1st arrondissement and the Arsenal port near Bastille in the 4th arrondissement along the right bank of the Seine were closed to traffic. The highway on the left bank had been closed previously. Drivers＊ organisations were furious and complained that lengthy traffic jams caused by the closure were increasing pollution. , but City Hall insists they will remain closed.Hidalgo said she was ※acting for future generations§ and would not be diverted by critics＊ attacks.  for several days and offered free public transport as pollution choked the city.Hidalgo said: ※The pedestrianisation of the city centre is starting ＃ the idea is to go step by step towards the pedestrianisation of the city centre. It will remain open to vehicles belonging to local residents, the police, emergency services and for deliveries, but not to all comers. ※We say clearly that our aim is the significant reduction in car traffic, as all the world＊s large cities are doing. We must constantly remind people: the fewer cars there are, the less pollution there is.§"																																																			
"From the upstairs windows in Colin MacQueen＊s house there isn＊t a view of the sea but he can clearly see the ships. Docked in the port, less than half a mile away, they tower over the roofs of flats and houses. ※They are colossal,§ he said. ※These cruise liners are much bigger than the container ships. They use as much fuel as whole towns.§The view is pretty spectacular. But it＊s what he cannot see that worries MacQueen. Like many cities across the UK,  has such poor air quality it breaches international guidelines, and while the government and local authorities are looking to take action on cars, maritime fuel 每 the dirtiest and most polluting of all diesels 每 is on no one＊s radar. Not only do the giant cruise liners churn out pollutants at sea, they also keep their engines running when they are docked in places like MacQueen＊s home town.※Then there are the passenger vehicles and the hundreds of HGV trucks coming into the port every day,§ said MacQueen, a Clean Air Southampton campaigner. ※On some days Southampton just grinds to a halt because of the volume.§Britain is in the midst of something of a seafaring renaissance, with a growth in seagoing freight and an explosion in the holiday cruise market. Around the country, docks including those at Plymouth, Liverpool, Greenwich, Orkney, Edinburgh and Hull are proposing or working on expansions to accommodate more and bigger cruise and cargo ships.The number of Britons taking cruise holidays is estimated to surpass 2 million this year, double the number a decade ago. Globally, some 25 million people set sail last year, up by 10 million in a decade.Once seen as a reserve for the rich and elderly, cruises now draw a wide variety of holidaymakers, said Andy Harmer, UK director of the trade body Cruise Lines International Association. ※There is now a huge choice, from small expedition cruises of 100 guests to places like Borneo and Antartica, to the 6,000- plus guests going to the Med and Baltic, with absolutely everything on board.※More and more places are opening up for tourists: there are now 50 ports in the UK and Ireland that people on cruises can visit, and 19 cruise ports they can drive to to start their holiday. It＊s convenient and easy, and you can take all your luggage in the car right to the ship. Everything is on board for the whole family and you sail to great places. It＊s a bit like the aviation industry: once everyone had to go to Heathrow or Gatwick, but then the regional airports opened up and it all became more accessible. The same thing is happening with cruises.§Harmer insisted that the industry was taking the consequent environmental concerns seriously. ※We are ahead of the game in terms of technologies being invested in 每 certainly compared with resort-style hotels on land. Cruise ships have their own water treatment, everything is recycled and it is in our interests to maintain the cleanliness of the ocean.§For maritime towns, the issue is fraught, given the benefits the great ships bring. A campaign to stop the construction of a cruise terminal in Greenwich, south east London, failed last year, despite evidence of its impact on air quality. . ※Unlike for airports, railways and roads, the Department for Transport does not provide clear guidance on which ports should be prioritised for expansion, but generally supports growth,§ said Melissa Moore, policy head at the . ※This lack of strategy, and competition between ports, results in most trying to develop to attract cruise liner and shipping business.※Ever-larger ships necessitate capital dredges to expand navigational channels, which can result in habitat removal and smothering as well as increased CO, sulphur and nitric oxides [SOx and NOx] emissions in the region.※The estuaries and harbours that house these ports are often marine protected areas. While habitat creation can sometimes compensate for damage, a more strategic approach would reduce pressures on the marine environment, as well as on climate and human health.§Dr Matt Loxham, an ocean and earth scientist at Southampton University, points out that it is not just ports but also Britain＊s coast-hugging shipping lanes that create pollution, and these are not being measured, or considered in official air quality analysis. ※We pay a lot more attention to cars 每 probably rightly. But it means we know a lot more about what comes out of a car than what comes out of a ship. Unlike with car diesel, we don＊t really understand the health implications from the pollutants and particle types.※These big ships can be moored for several days as they load up, with engines idling. There is clearly a tightrope to be walked between quality of life for people and jobs and benefits to a city.§ claims one medium cruise ship emits as many pollutants as five million cars going the same distance. It says the ships belch out 3,500 times more sulphur dioxide than cars 每 although international rules to reduce sulphur emissions in shipping are due to come into force in 2020.Areeba Hamid, a Greenpeace UK air pollution campaigner, said: ※Shipping has long been a destination for low-quality fuel that no one would be allowed to burn on land. If ports want to expand, they need to demonstrate that they are not going to worsen people＊s exposure to harmful pollution, or they must insist that ships using their ports have much higher standards than those currently in force.§For MacQueen, local ecomony benefits are not enough. ※We are surrounded by water, but you can hardly get to it: the marine development dominates. So you have in our city a massive money-making concern but there seems to be little trickle-down. It could be having a massive impact on our health and we are in thrall to it.§"																																																			
"Cutting toxic levels of city air pollution to safer levels is simple, but not easy 每 it requires resolve. Yet, despite the key culprit in the UK being well known 每 diesel vehicles 每 the government has been asleep at the wheel for years.Levels of nitrogen dioxide have been  across much of the UK since 2010. In 2015 86% of major urban areas broke annual limits. Cutting this pollution means choking off diesel emissions and there is a wide range of effective measures available.Creating zones in city centres where polluting cars are either banned or charged is important, while making cities safe for cycling and walking cuts traffic too. Cleaner buses and taxis have an important role to play and change to the perverse taxes that encourage people to buy diesel over cleaner cars is needed. There is also some support for a revival of a scrappage scheme which saw dirty old bangers taken off the road. The environment and transport departments were well aware of all this and proposed many of these measures internally, only for the , arguing they ※would be politically very difficult, especially given the impacts on motorists§.Motorists happen to be particularly badly exposed to air pollution, but the real political difficulty for the government is  where judges ruled its air pollution plans were so bad they were illegal.

It is absolutely essential that he now delivers on his promises and that the national government back him to the hilt.§Andrews, who lives in Brixton, said Khan had promised an expanded ultra-low emission zone in 2019, which limits polluting vehicles, and to deploy the cleanest buses on the most polluted roads. ※While these are vital steps in the right direction, we can＊t wait another three years for action,§ Andrews said. ※We need immediate action to cut pollution in the short-term and protect Londoners＊ health during these pollution spikes.§ In December, Khan  at bus stops, tube stations and roadsides due to high levels.A spokesman for the mayor said: ※The Brixton Road [breach] underscores why urgent action is needed to improve air quality across .§ He said Khan would shortly be announcing 10 new low emission bus zones, including one for Brixton Road.※But this is not enough,§ said the spokesman. ※The government needs to match the Mayor＊s commitment to improving air quality as quickly as possible.§Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said the early breach in Brixton was shocking: ※This shows the extent of the public health crisis we are facing.

Putney High Street, where high buildings trap pollution, was the worst. Its annual average for last year was 125 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre, over three times the limit of 40?g/m3.

"Modern diesel cars produce 10 times more toxic air pollution than heavy trucks and buses, new European data has revealed.The stark difference in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is due to the much stricter testing applied to large vehicles in the EU, according to the researchers behind a new report. They say the same strict measures must be applied to cars.NOx pollution is responsible for , with the UK suffering a particularly high toll. Much of the pollution is produced by diesel cars, which  than allowed in the official lab-based tests. Following the Volkswagen ※dieselgate§ scandal, the car tests are due to be toughened, but campaigners say the reforms do not go far enough.The  (ICCT), a research group that played a , compared the emissions from trucks and buses in realistic driving conditions with those of cars.It found that heavy-duty vehicles tested in Germany and Finland emitted about 210mg NOx per kilometre driven, less than half the 500mg/km pumped out by modern diesel cars that meet the highest ※Euro 6§ standard. However, the buses and trucks have larger engines and burn more diesel per kilometre, meaning that cars produce 10 times more NOx per litre of fuel.The ICCT analysis showed that manufacturers were able to ensure that heavy duty vehicles kept below pollution limits when on the road, but that emissions from cars soar once in the real world.Official EU tests for cars are currently limited to laboratory measurements of prototype vehicles. ※In contrast, for measurement of NOx emissions from trucks and buses, mobile testing devices became mandatory in 2013. As a consequence, randomly selected vehicles can be tested under real-world driving conditions,§ said Peter Mock, managing director of ICCT in .Changes to the car testing regime in the EU are due to start in September, with mobile devices, called portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS), attached to vehicles as they drive on real roads. But Mock warned: ※Manufacturers will still be allowed to carefully select special prototype cars for emissions testing. Instead, it would be much better to measure the emissions of ordinary mass-production vehicles, obtained from customers who have had been driving them in an ordinary way.§ Such a system is used in the US where the dieselgate scandal first emerged.

"Unless you＊ve avoided social media for the last week, you probably know that last year,  was able to produce 98% of its electricity without oil 每 a feat that most larger and wealthier countries have never accomplished.Over the past few days, reports of Costa Rica＊s 271 days of fossil-fuel free electricity have made their way to almost every corner of the internet.The news has bolstered the Central American country＊s already outstanding environmental reputation 每 but the excitement has masked another less-than-green truth about Costa Rica＊s energy use: the country＊s demand for oil is actually growing. The country uses a mix of hydro, wind and geothermal to power the homes of its 4.9 million people, but because of its gasoline-dependent transportation sector, renewables make up less than a quarter of the nation＊s total energy use. According to Costa Rica＊s , the country has approximately 287 cars per 1,000 people, surpassing both the world and Latin American average.Hybrids and electric cars that can feed off the renewable electricity grid make up less than 2% of those vehicles, and according to the national oil refinery, gas purchases increased by 11% in 2016.This explosive growth in private vehicles is causing more than just pollution. Traffic in the capital, San Jos谷, has become almost unmanageable, with the city earning the worst ranking for congestion in Latin America, according to . While the footage of Costa Rica＊s pristine jungles may suggest otherwise, this traffic-plagued city is home to more than half of all Costa Ricans 每 many of whom have lost their appetite for San Jos谷＊s antiquated bus system. With more Costa Ricans now able to afford cars, demand for oil is expected to continue growing, unless major changes are made to attract people to public transit and electric vehicles.Alongside a growing thirst for fuel, demand for electricity is also rising in Costa Rica, but new renewable generation infrastructure will likely cover the increase.※For 2017, we expect renewable electricity generation to remain stable,§ ICE＊s executive president, Carlos Manuel Obreg車n, said recently. ※We have four new wind plants and expect favorable rain conditions in the basins that feed our plants.§Aside from the new wind farms, the Reventaz車n hydroelectric dam near the country＊s Caribbean coast became fully functional in September. With the capacity to power an estimated 525,000 homes, the new dam is strategically positioned to take advantage of the increased rainfall in the country＊s Caribbean region, and will be critical for maintaining hydroelectric production in the face of repeated droughts in other parts of the country.The Reventaz車n is now the largest hydroelectric project in Central America, but the region has long relied on dams for power. Though Costa Rica has made major investments in wind and geothermal plants in the last 25 years 每 with its percentage of non-hydro renewables well surpassing the world average 每 the country still routinely produces more than 70% of its electricity each year using dams. Though hydropower is cleaner than burning bunker fuel for electricity, the heavy reliance on dams carries its own cost. The Reventaz車n project was criticized by environmental groups for its position along a critical wildlife corridor and the planned Diqu赤s dam in the country＊s south-west has been held up for years due to conflicts with indigenous groups. While the country has continued to view dams as a viable way to create renewable electricity, solar power has been pushed aside, due to political concerns that home- generated power would cut into the state electricity company＊s profits. Despite the country＊s limitations, Costa Rica＊s renewable electricity production will probably continue to grow, as the government explores options to begin exporting its surplus electricity to its neighbors.

"People living near a busy road have an increased risk of dementia, according to research that adds to concerns about the impact of air pollution on human health.Roughly one in 10 cases of Alzheimer＊s in urban areas could be associated with living amid heavy traffic, the study estimated 每 although the research stopped short of showing that exposure to exhaust fumes causes neurodegeneration.Hong Chen, the scientist who led the work at Public  Ontario, said: ※Increasing population growth and urbanisation has placed many people close to heavy traffic, and with widespread exposure to traffic and growing rates of dementia, even a modest effect from near-road exposure could pose a large public health burden.§Previously, scientists have linked air pollution and traffic noise to reduced density of white matter (the brain＊s connective tissue) and . A recent study suggested that magnetic nano-particles from air pollution .The latest study, published in , found that those who live closest to major traffic arteries were up to 12% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia 每 a small but significant increase in risk.The study, which tracked roughly 6.6 million people for more than a decade, could not determine whether pollution is directly harmful to the brain. The increased dementia risk could also be a knock-on effect of respiratory and cardiac problems caused by traffic fumes or due to other unhealthy life-style factors associated with living in built-up urban environments.Rob Howard, a professor of old age psychiatry at University College London, who was not involved in the study, said: ※We know that major road air pollution is bad for general health and this latest study doesn＊t tell us whether the small increase in dementia risk is driven by indirect effects or whether proximity to traffic directly influences dementia pathology. Regardless of the route of causation, this study presents one more important reason why we must clean up the air in our cities.§However, others cautioned that those living close to main roads should not be unduly alarmed by the findings. Prof John Hardy, a neuroscientist at University College London said: ※The analyses are exceedingly complex ＃ and this always leads to concerns that the analytic complexity is hiding confounding factors in the analytic pipeline. There are several reasons why one might not want to live near a major road, but this study is not an additional one.§The study tracked all adults aged between 20 and 85 living in Ontario, Canada from 2001 to 2012, using postcodes to determine a person＊s proximity to major roads. The cohort＊s medical records were examined to see who went on to develop dementia, Parkinson＊s disease or multiple sclerosis.Over the study period, more than 243,000 people developed dementia, 31,500 people developed Parkinson＊s disease and 9,250 people developed multiple sclerosis.The scientists found no link between living near a road and Parkinson＊s disease or multiple sclerosis, but dementia was slightly more common in people living close to busy roads and the risk dropped off gradually in less built-up areas. Those living within 50 metres of a busy road had a 7% higher risk in developing dementia, the risk was 4% higher risk at 50-100 metres, 2% higher risk at 101-200 metres and there was no increase in risk in those living more than 200 metres away.Those who lived in a major city, within 50 metres of a major road and who did not move house for the duration of the study had the highest risk at 12%.The scientists took into account wealth, education, and various other measures of health and social status in their calculations, although they acknowledged that it was impossible to eliminate the potential for other confounding factors playing a role.Ray Copes, chief of environmental and occupational health at Public Health Ontario, and a co-author of the Lancet paper, said that those living in cities should consider walking along side streets, jogging in parks and planning cycle routes along quieter roads where possible. ※The real implications are not for individual choice, but at the societal and policy level,§ he said, adding that air pollution should be factored into urban planning and building design to reduce exposure."

But surpassing even this is for sheer excitement is Transport for London＊s , 250 pages of fascinating facts that weren＊t published eight months ago. Let＊s luxuriate in just a few.The big transport trend in London since 2000, when the mayoralty and TfL were created, has been the large fall in private car use and the large rise in that of public transport. The report tells us that in 2015/16, 43% of  households had no access to a car, that the total volume of road traffic in 2015 was 10% lower than in 2000, and that this century has seen the ※mode share§ of public transport rise from 28% to 37% while that of motorised private transport has fallen from 47% to 36%. Walking, the other big way of getting around the capital, has retained a 24% share. The shift away from cars towards buses, rail and Underground is projected to continue, albeit at a slower rate. Public transport＊s share is expected to reach 40% by 2041 and that of cars (and other private motor vehicles) to fall to 30%, with walking inching up to 25%.It might give little comfort to those who rely on the , but for most users of different types of train travel in the metropolis, things have got bigger and better. Underground capacity and reliability continued to go up in 2015/16, Overground use rose by 32% and the report even remarks that ※general reliability of National Rail has improved§ over time, though it politely observes that ※available capacity into central London during the weekday morning peak remains a major constraint§. Customer satisfaction measurements, including for the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), are all significantly higher than they were five years ago. Underground, surface rail and DLR combined accounted for 24% of all individual journey stages in 2015 (see pie chart on ) with the former two quintessential to travel between outer and central London: some 84% of all complete trips are by rail or Underground, says the report. The report says that people used a bus to get from A to B an estimated 3.9 million times every week in 2015. Yet this reflected the first fall in bus ridership by that measure since 2006, which was the only previous one since 1995 (see ). Service reliability has suffered lately too. These as yet small yet worrying developments are described as being ※in line with a rise in general traffic congestion§, which is explored in chapter 6. TfL＊s ※congestion pie§ representation () has slices for accidents (9%), road and street works (7%) and ※spillages and crane operations§ (5%), but by far the biggest portion is labelled simply ※excess traffic§ (75%). It puts the financial cost of congestion in 2015 on the  TfL is responsible for at ?1.3b, up 8% compared with 2014. The bus, London＊s cheapest form of public transport and the one used by the widest range of Londoners, especially in Inner London, is another congestion casualty.Take a look at , which introduces an ※an over-arching framework for the design and management of London＊s streets§ aimed at facilitating active travel, reducing car dependency and tackling poor air quality. Ten ※healthy streets§ outcomes are set out and the role the transport system can play in improving peoples＊ health is explained. Sadly, the report＊s statistics show that too few of us get around the city in ways that involve exercise, even if we are young. Although there＊s lots of walking, not enough of it is of sufficient duration to do us much good. The amount of cycling has more than doubled this century, nearly trebling in central London, but its mode share for both complete trips and individual journey stages across Greater London as a whole was just 2% in 2015, the same figure as for the previous ten years. It is hoped that new and future cycling provision will help push that number up to 6% by 2041. There＊s a lot more on transport＊s environmental performance in Chapter 8.

"Millions in  rang in the New Year shrouded in a thick blanket of toxic smog, causing road closures and flight cancellations as 24 cities issued alerts that will last through much of the week.On the first day of 2017 in Beijing, concentrations of tiny particles that penetrate deep into the lungs climbed  levels recommended by the World Health Organization. More than 100 flights were cancelled and all intercity buses were halted at the capital＊s airport.In the neighbouring port city of Tianjin, more than 300 flights were cancelled while the weather forecast warned thick smog will persist until 5 January. All of the city＊s highways were also shut as low visibility made driving hazardous, effectively trapping residents. Across northern China 24 cities issued red alerts on Friday and Saturday, while orange alerts persisted in 21 cities through the New Year holiday. A red alert is the highest level of a four-tier warning system introduced as part of China＊s high-profile . Decades of economic development have made acrid air a common occurrence in nearly all major Chinese cities, with government-owned coal burning power stations and heating plants and steel manufacturing concentrated in northern provinces the main source of pollution. Smog worsens in the winter as coal burning spikes to provide heat for millions of people. China declared a ※war on pollution§ in 2014, but has struggled to deliver the sweeping change many had hoped to see and government inspections routinely find pollutions flouting the law. ※Why didn＊t those polluting industries take a rest for the holiday,§ one commenter mused on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo.※New Year＊s morning in Beijing, I thought I was blind,§ said another, attaching a photo of a window completely darkened with grey haze.

The city council said in a statement: ※vehicles with even-number registration plates will be allowed to drive around on even-number days and cars with odd-number registration plates on odd-number days§. The measure is activated when levels of harmful nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere go above 200 microgrammes per cubic metre in at least two measuring stations for two days running, and if the air is unlikely to clear imminently.On Thursday, city environment councillor Ines Sabanes said the ban would not be extended as smog levels had dropped by the required amount. Other measures, including a ban on street parking for non-residents and reduced speed limits, will continue.There are exceptions to the ban, such as for mopeds, hybrid cars, those carrying three people or more or used by disabled people. Buses, taxis and emergency vehicles are also exempt.※It＊s not about traffic restrictions but about the important issue of public health,§ deputy mayor Marta Higueras said. ※Lots of people suffer from breathing problems and are very affected by pollution.§With 3.2 million residents and 1.8m cars, Madrid often suffers from bad bouts of pollution. The move to ban half of cars is level three on a scale of four anti-pollution measures. Level four bans taxis from the city, except those that are hybrid cars.The measure implemented by the city hall, which has been led by an alliance of leftist groups since 2015, sparked criticism from the conservative Popular party (PP) which ruled Madrid for nearly a quarter of a century and governs at the national level.??igo Henr赤quez de Luna, a PP spokesman in Madrid＊s local parliament, called the move ※ideological§ and said authorities should do more to encourage residents to avoid using their cars rather than punish them.The anti-pollution measures were implemented by former PP mayor Ana Botella just before municipal elections in May 2015."

However, a huge range of US business leaders argue the opposite, saying the fast-growing green economy is an opportunity for the US.Twenty-five leading companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google, Levi Strauss and Unilever, are running an advert in the US media on Thursday, urging Trump not to abandon the Paris deal. They say the accord＊s ※stable and practical framework§ creates jobs and is good for business. More than , including DuPont, eBay and Nike, have also backed the Paris deal, saying: ※Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.§ The Tesla boss, Elon Musk, said he had urged Trump to back Paris and  from two presidential advisory bodies he serves on.World leaders also stated their commitment to the Paris deal, with China＊s premier Li Keqiang saying on Thursday that fighting climate change was a ※global consensus§ and an ※international responsibility§.

Prof Gabi Hegerl, of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, said: ※We know that to limit warming and the impacts it causes, we need to limit the total amount of carbon added to the atmosphere. This can only be done if the world economies work together. If Paris is abandoned or weakened, I fear for the future of our children.§If Trump does pull the US from the Paris deal, US city mayors have said they will abide by it nonetheless.

"Donald Trump＊s decision to pull out of the Paris agreement on climate change means the US joins only two other countries not signed up to the historic accord.The only other UN members not signed up are  and Syria, which both chose not to enter into the climate accord in the first place.Their reasons for doing so were very different from those that seem to be influencing Donald Trump, who has previously described climate change as a hoax.Nicaragua declined to sign up because it thought the accord did not go far enough. In November 2015, Paul Oquist, Nicaragua＊s lead envoy to the Paris negotiations, : ※We＊re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure. We don＊t want to be an accomplice to taking the world to 3 to 4 degrees and the death and destruction that represents.§ The Bonn-based UN climate body has requested all countries in a position to do so to submit ※intended nationally determined contributions§ to international efforts to hold warming to 2C.The following month, : ※Universal responsibility 每 everyone is responsible 每 is a spin on historical responsibility, because everyone didn＊t create this problem.§ Nicaragua＊s  (0.03%) pales beside that of the US (13.19%), yet it came fourth on a list of countries most affected by climate change between 1996 and 2015, according to .For its part, Syria . The government of Bashar al-Assad has been heavily sanctioned by the UN over human rights violations, making it a pariah to much of the international community. The sanctions would have made it difficult for members of the Syrian government to travel to Paris to attend the discussions, and the ongoing conflict would have made it difficult for it to commit to any limitation of the country＊s emissions. Nevertheless, other countries in the midst of conflict have signed up, including , as well other countries isolated by the international community, such as .

"A  would go down as a hallmark of his presidency. It would be unilateral, reckless and splashy 每 trademark Trump. The president has  he will announce his decision at 3pm ET (8pm BST) on Thursday. But while Trump has often stood on a range of issues as a maverick outlier from mainstream Republican politics, on climate change he is at the centre of the party＊s orthodoxy. Trump＊s disbelief in climate change and imminent decision on whether to support the Paris agreement reflects an area of unusual agreement between the president and elected Republicans, whose track record of climate change denialism .Unmissable behind the elected  stand other interests: the oil, gas and coal industries, which together are some of the most influential donors to Republican candidates.The big-money supporters got a return on their investment last week, when 22 Republican senators whose campaigns have collected more than $10m in oil, gas and coal money since 2012 sent a letter to the president urging him to withdraw from the Paris deal.Trump had been said to be on the fence about the deal. Members of his inner circle, , were reported to favor staying in.※We strongly encourage you to make a clean break from the Paris Agreement,§ read the letter, drafted by Wyoming＊s John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate committee on environment and public works, and Oklahoma＊s Jim Inhofe,  and senior member of that committee.The letter argued that the Paris deal threatened Tru, an Obama-era set of regulations and guidelines that include emissions caps and other rules deemed onerous by the fossil fuel industries.It was not as if Trump wanted for advisers urging him to withdraw from the Paris deal even before the letter was sent. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Stephen Bannon urged withdrawal, while energy secretary Rick Perry favored renegotiation. Public opposition to the deal from almost two dozen senators just as the president prepared to make his decision, however, demonstrated the extent to which the opponents of the Paris deal were organized, ready to strike and to offer important political cover if Trump pulls the US out of the historic global deal. Donations from oil, gas and coal interests to the signatories of the letter are  that seemed ready for a new review. A Guardian survey of Federal Elections Commission data organized by the Center for Responsive Politics found that the industries gave a total of $10,694,284 to the 22 senators over the past three election cycles.Visible donations to Republicans from those industries exceeded donations to Democrats in the 2016 election cycle by a ratio of 15-to-1,  the Center for Responsive Politics.

"In the Brazilian city of S?o Paulo, more than 80 experts, including dozens of climate scientists, gathered back in March for a giant planning meeting.As part of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the group from 39 different countries were starting their  that will tell governments and policymakers what kind of impacts they can expect when global warming reaches 1.5C.That report is scheduled to be ready in late September 2018 and will assess in detail what＊s known about the impacts 1.5C of global warming could have on societies, ecosystems and efforts to reduce poverty.But  suggests that just eight years after that report is published, the world might have already reached that 1.5C target 每 or at least one definition of it (some senior scientists disagree with some of the assumptions in the paper 每 read on for those important caveats).Published in the journal , the research looks closely at the influence of a mechanism in the climate known as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO).※The IPO is like the long-term version of El Ni?o 每 it＊s like El Ni?o＊s uncle,§ says Ben Henley of the University of Melbourne and the research＊s lead author.When heat gets trapped in deeper layers of the Pacific Ocean, this is known as a negative phase of the IPO. Since about the year 2000, the IPO hit this negative phase, which tends to slow down the rise in global temperatures that＊s being caused by humans burning too many fossil fuels and cutting down forests. But around 2014, scientists say that this IPO started to shift, possibly towards a positive phase that would act like an accelerator on global warming.Henley and his colleague Andrew King, also at the University of Melbourne, wanted to know how quick global temperatures might reach 1.5C, relative to where they were between 1850 and 1900. According to the paper, the ※rate that global temperatures approach the 1.5C level is likely to be significantly quicker, or slower, depending on the IPO§.After using the latest computer models of the climate and allowing for the added greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Henley and King looked to see what the coming decades have in store depending on the phase of the IPO. If the IPO turns positive, then the average across the models shows that global temperatures hit 1.5C in around 2026. If the IPO was to turn negative, then this delays the 1.5C threshold by five years or so.Henley told me: ※Policymakers have to be aware of just how quickly we are approaching this level. But that doesn＊t mean that the target is not a sensible thing to have.※While we might overshoot 1.5C, stabilising global temperatures at that level still remains a worthwhile goal.§The paper also gives other projections for breaching 1.5C based on different assumptions and different models. For example, if you wait until global temperatures go above 1.5C over a five-year average period, then some models suggest that if the IPO stays negative for longer, the 1.5C breach doesn＊t happen until around the year 2040 (but this is an outlier in the paper). Associate Professor Julie Arblaster, a climate scientist at Monash University who was not involved in the research, told me the research ※highlights the role of natural or internal variability in the climate system in hitting climate targets§,Arblaster pointed to one study published last year in the journal  that suggested the switch to a positive phase of the IPO might have already happened.She added: ※Other things may also impact the timing of course, such as a large volcanic eruption, but this study helps by providing an estimate of the contribution of the climate system＊s internal variability in hitting that target.§Henley told me a key motivation for doing the sums on the 1.5C target was to help policymakers understand what kind of timeframe they have to work with. When countries were negotiating for a new global deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow the impacts of climate change, many smaller and less developed countries were worried that a 2C global warming target was setting the bar way too high. Some scientists also shared this concern.So there was a push to have a 1.5C target included in the text of the deal.Article 2 of the Paris agreement states that countries agree to keep global warming ※well below 2C above pre-industrial levels§ but to also pursue efforts ※to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C ＃ recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change§.Bill Hare is an Australian climate scientist and founder of scientific consultancy group Climate Analytics. Hare is a veteran of the United Nations climate talks.In an email, Hare said the paper showed ※that very ambitious near-term mitigation is required to limit warming to 1.5∼C and this analysis underscores this§.But Hare and his colleagues also had some reservations about the paper＊s conclusions. Hare said the IPCC＊s interpretation of when you can say that 1.5C target is breached was based on much longer time periods than the Henley and King paper.He also said the assumption in the paper that greenhouse gas emissions would continue to rise under a ※business as usual§ scenario didn＊t reflect how countries were taking action under the Paris agreement. Using more optimistic scenarios could bring temperatures down by as much as 0.2C by 2030.Joeri Rogelj of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, also pointed out that the convention in UN climate negotiations was to refer to targets in terms of longer time frames of 20 or 30 years.He thought the paper＊s assumptions that emissions would remain high were ※not compatible§ with the agreements countries had made in Paris, but he did agree that the paper demonstrated how urgent the issue was.Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, is a senior lead author on a chapter of the special report that will look at the impacts of 1.5C global warming on humans and natural environments.Hoegh-Guldberg, who was not speaking from an IPCC perspective, told me the research would ※wake some people up to the fact that exceeding 1.5C will happen within the next decade, give or take a couple of years§.※One unknown that＊s associated with the study is the effect that anthropogenic climate change might be having on these long-term climate patterns themselves. Some research groups have provided compelling evidence that patterns associated with El Ni?o, for example, may actually be amplified by warming.§He added: ※Many scientists have increasingly pointed to the unmanageable ecological and human impacts as average global surface temperatures exceed 1.5∼C, and great economic and environmental costs that are likely to be associated. ※Unfortunately, past inaction means that we will exceed 1.5C no matter what we do. The key issue, however, is what we do next. ※People speak of overshoots as being one of the scenarios that we are likely to face. This is not an escape clause as the overshoot is likely to be catastrophic.§"																																																			
																																																			
"Alaska＊s soils are taking far longer to freeze over as winter approaches than in previous decades, resulting in a surge in carbon dioxide emissions that could portend a much faster rate of  than scientists had previously estimated, according to new research. Measurements of carbon dioxide levels taken from aircraft, satellites and on the ground show that the amount of CO2 emitted from Alaska＊s frigid northern tundra increased by 70% between 1975 and 2015, in the period between October and December each year. Researchers said warming temperatures and thawing soils were the likely cause of the increase in CO2 at a time of year when the upper layers of soil usually start freezing over as winter sets in. In the  summer, the upper level of soil, which sits above a vast sheet of permafrost that covers much of Alaska, thaws out and decomposing organic matter starts to produce CO2. From October, colder temperatures help freeze the soil again, locking up the CO2.Alaska＊s warming autumns and winters are altering this process. Whereas soils 40 years ago took about a month to completely freeze over, the process can now take three months or longer. In some places in the state, the soil is not freezing until January, particularly if there is a layer of insulating snow.The result is a huge and continuing expulsion of CO2, a planet-warming gas, into the atmosphere. In 2013, a particularly warm year racked by wildfires in , around 40m more tons of CO2 was given out by soils than absorbed by vegetation 每 an amount four times larger than that emitted by the state＊s use of fossil fuels.※A lot of models were predicting this thawing would happen, but not for another 50 to 100 years 每 we didn＊t think it would happen this quickly,§ said Roisin Commane, researcher at the  and lead author of the report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ※The timescale of this surprised many of us,§ she said. ※There is a lot of potential CO2 from these soils, which worries people. We＊d prefer the carbon stays there.§ Commane said the large volume of CO2 released suggested some of it was coming from permafrost. Typically found a meter or so below much of Alaska, permafrost contains carbon that has been frozen for up to 40,000 years. It is being scrutinized by scientists concerned that it is starting to thaw.  It is estimated that Arctic permafrost  as the Earth＊s entire atmosphere. This means its disappearance would probably contribute to a severe change in the climate that would be dangerous to many species, including humans. ※Some of this CO2 has to come from permafrost thawing but we don＊t know how much,§ said Commane. ※That is something we really want to work out.§ Data for the research was taken from Nasa analysis of CO2 from aircraft and satellites, as well as readings from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration station in Barrow, Alaska. The Arctic is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world and Alaska has experienced three record warm years in a row. In 2016, the average temperature was 5.9F warmer than the long-term average.※The entire Alaska region is responding to climate change,§ said Donatella Zona of San Diego State University in California, who was not affiliated with the study. ※The amount of carbon lost from Arctic ecosystems to the atmosphere in the fall has increased significantly over the past 40 years. By better capturing these cold season processes and putting previous smaller-scale measurements into a bigger context, this study will help scientists in their efforts to improve climate models and predictions of Arctic climate change.§ "																																																			
"New European cars with petrol engines will be allowed to overshoot a limit on toxic particulates emissions by 50% under a draft EU regulation backed by the UK and most other EU states.Campaigners say that a simple 25 (?22) filter could drastically cut the pollution, but the Guardian has learned that car-makers have instead mounted a successful push for loopholes and legislative delay. Bas Eickhout, a Green MEP on the European parliament＊s environment committee and  inquiry panel, promised action to ensure that the lessons of the  were learned. ※With this ridiculous proposal, the EU＊s member states are again trying to dilute EU laws at a terrible cost to human health. We will call on the European commission to come to the European parliament and explain themselves on this issue,§ he said.Particulate matter (PM) is the  to the estimated  across Europe from pollution-related heart and lung diseases each year. Children and the elderly are worst affected, and the associated health costs could be as high as 1.6tn a year in Europe, . Although exhaust fumes from diesel and petrol engines are one of the largest sources of particulates emissions, most EU member states support raising the EU＊s pollution standard 50% above the legal limit set down in the Euro 6 regulation. Behind the scenes, vehicle makers have pushed strongly for a staggering 300% over, according to material seen by the Guardian.The draft regulation is still being discussed by EU member states and the auto industry has not given up hopes of wrenching further concessions on particulate emissions ahead of a final decision on 7 December. One Powerpoint slide shown to EU expert groups by the European automobile manufacturers association (Acea) says that a 300% latitude in meeting the letter of the law would be ※realistic§ because of ※measurement uncertainty§ in emissions tests. Florent Grelier, a clean vehicles engineer at the Transport and Environment (T&E) campaign group, told the Guardian he feared that EU attempts to improve air quality were being ※bent to the will of the automotive industry§.  ※This is a petrolgate scandal in the making,§ he said. ※Unless the European commission and governments establish strict test procedures to protect the industry from its own short-sightedness, within a few years we will see continuing high levels of particles killing hundreds of thousands of citizens prematurely.§ Under EU law, car-manufacturers are already obliged to use filters for diesel engines, but not for the rapidly-growing 40% of the petrol engine market which is made up by uncontrolled gasoline direct injection engines. These release more particulate matter than modern diesel cars. Gasoline particulate filters could reduce these emissions by a factor of around 100, and would cost manufacturers just 25 per car, according to research by T&E. But car manufacturers have argued this would violate the principle of technology neutrality. A spokesman for Acea declined to comment on the issue.Calls by the auto industry for a delay in implementing the new regulation have been well received by several car-producing EU countries. Spain and Sweden argued for a one-year legislative delay that would push its introduction back to 2019, in minutes of a technical committee meeting earlier this month seen by the Guardian. The UK took no formal position on when the new regulation should enter into force but warned of ※unintended adverse effects§ if PM limits were given a separate starting date to standards for another pollutant, nitriogen oxide (NOx) , which will now begin in 2019. An EU group of national experts 每 the technical committee on motor vehicles - is now expected to sign off on the final proposal to amend the Euro 6 regulation for real world driving emissions, in December.

Only around 5% of the world＊s population flies at all, yet the impacts of climate change 每 droughts, floods and heatwaves 每 are already hitting poorer communities in the global south, who are the least likely to ever set foot on a plane.The push for more runway space is not about demand from business 每 that has been dropping for over a decade. Nor is it about people taking one or two annual holidays. Growth is being driven by the frequent leisure flyers taking weekend breaks and shopping trips by plane. Half of the UK population don＊t fly in any given year, yet all of us subsidise the holidays of the rich.The UK must not abandon our commitments under the Paris agreement and the Climate Change Act for the convenience of binge flyers. We will not allow our government to ignore the promises they have made to us and to the world. Nigel Milton, director of external affairs at Heathrow, says the Airports Commission＊s analysis ※concluded that a third runway at Heathrow can be delivered in accordance with EU air-quality limit law, and would have less impact on health receptors (where people live and work) than a runway at Gatwick would have on the community in that area§ (, 22 October).It made no such conclusion at all. Quite the opposite, in fact; the 2015 Business and Sustainability Assessment said of the Heathrow North West Runway that ※against the Commission＊s objective to improve air quality consistent with EU standards and local planning policy requirements the unmitigated impact of the Heathrow Northwest Runway scheme is SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSE. Mitigations as above could limit this impact to ADVERSE if delivered with concerted effort from all parties including HAL but given the increases in pollutant concentrations at various health receptors and despite the fact that EU and local policy limits are not necessarily breached, the impact is unlikely to be able to reach a NEUTRAL level.※The Heathrow Airport Northwest Runway scheme performs more poorly than Gatwick with respect to EU limit values as Gatwick has no monitoring stations predicted to be in breach of EU limit values, but more strongly than Heathrow Airport Extended Northern Runway§.Since that was written, it has been verified that EU emissions limits around Heathrow are actually being breached now.Mr Milton and others may be of the view that Heathrow expansion will be the best thing ever for the economy with ?211bn in economic benefits, although without any explanation I suspect that figure may be plucked out of the air. Benefits or not, one thing is for certain 每 Heathrow is poisoning the residents around it now and will do so more if expanded. The Cambridge study is not worth the paper that it is written on. It is theoretical and modelled, and it depends on compliance with the Euro 6 engine emissions limits. Tests have shown that while vehicles may comply in laboratory situations, they are failing by up to 1,500% when out on the road. Nigel Milton appears to be living in a parallel universe. Under current EU legislation, it is impossible to give the go-ahead for a third runway without an avalanche of legal challenges. Heathrow breaches the EU air quality directive for a number of pollutants, but nitrogen dioxide is the most intractable as local traffic and congestion is bound to increase in line with passenger numbers. The strategy being adopted by Heathrow management depends upon new diesel engines emitting less pollutants than current models, but this strategy is doomed to failure as recent studies demonstrate that even Euro 6 diesel engines emit much more NO on the road than they do in lab testing.I suspect the reason that Theresa May has delayed a parliamentary vote on Heathrow (, 19 October) is to give the UK parliament time to invoke article 50, and repeal the relevant EU air quality directive. However, the chances of such a manoeuvre getting past the House of Lords is close to zero."																																																			
"The Environmental Protection Agency has ※eviscerated§ a key scientific review board by removing half its members and seeking to replace them with industry-aligned figures, according to the board＊s chair. Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, has chosen not to renew the terms of nine of the 18-member , which advises the EPA on the quality and accuracy of the science it produces. The group, largely made up of academics, is set to be replaced by representatives from industries that the EPA regulates. Deborah Swackhamer, chair of the board, said that with other planned departures, the panel was left with five members, including her, in the midst of an EPA hiring freeze. ※The committee has been eviscerated,§ she told the Guardian. ※We assumed these people would be renewed and there was no reason or indication they wouldn＊t be. These people aren＊t Obama appointees, they are scientific appointees. To have a political decision to get rid of them was a shock.§ The nine departing members 每 who worked on matters including toxic water pollution, climate change and chemical safety 每 all completed three-year terms. The decision to not renew those terms has opened the way for the Trump administration to refashion the scientific board in line with its  that has sought to  in the name of ※regulatory certainty§.A spokesman for the agency told the New York Times: ※The administrator believes we should have people on this board who understand the impact of regulations on the regulated community.§ This could lead to multiple instances of conflicts of interest, Swackhamer said, despite clear EPA ethics rules. ※If you have industry hand-picked people,§ she said, ※the concern would be that they would have a frequent conflict because we discuss areas that touch upon big industry. ※This administration has made statements not terribly favourable to science. There would be a morality issue if the committee is turned into a political pawn of a certain viewpoint. Our credibility would be destroyed. We would be seen within the scientific community as tainted.§Courtney Flint, a board member and professor of natural resource sociology at Utah State University, said she was told on Friday her term would not be renewed.※This came as a surprise as I had been told that the appointment would be renewed,§ she told the Guardian, adding that the board ※has been careful to avoid partisanship in our scientific recommendations§.※I am hopeful that this advisory work can continue to be done by objective scientific experts that represent a cross-section of societal voices to inform policy.§  Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who sued the EPA multiple times over its pollution rules, has criticized the science produced by the agency to support its regulations. In March, Pruitt reversed a move to ban , a widely used pesticide, despite the advice of EPA scientists that it could be harmful to children and farm workers. Pruitt said: ※We are returning to using sound science in decision-making, rather than predetermined results.§John O＊Grady, president of a union that represents more than 9,000 EPA employees, said he was concerned that the agency would now be ※repopulated with scientists who operate within the realm of opinion, rather than fact§. ※We are already aware of the opinion of this administration and Mr Pruitt with respect to climate change,§ he said. ※However, opinions are neither fact nor theory and do not belong to the realm of science.※Without independence and sound peer review of the science conducted by the agency, it will be impossible to distinguish between good science and bad science at the US EPA.§ Republicans have complained about the EPA＊s scientific advisory board, claiming that it is too heavily weighted in favour of academics who support regulation. In February, Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science committee, said: ※The EPA routinely stacks this board with friendly scientists who receive millions of dollars in grants from the federal government. The conflict of interest here is clear.§ Members of the board, however, deny that they are politically motivated, pointing to the ethics training and vetting they receive, similar to that undergone by career public servants.Swackhamer said: ※We have spirited conversations about the science 每 we don＊t just rubber-stamp what the EPA wants to do. These people are valuable, highly qualified and highly vetted. It＊s troubling that political considerations have come into this.§In a statement to the Guardian, an EPA spokesman said: ※EPA received hundreds of nominations to serve on the board, and we want to ensure fair consideration of all the nominees 每 including those nominated who may have previously served on the panel 每 and carry out a competitive nomination process.§"																																																			
"At the intersection of two highways just outside downtown , a hulking relic of the city＊s past looms over the skyline: the largest municipal trash incinerator in the US. It＊s a facility that has raised concerns of nearby residents since its construction in the 1980s.And some days, it stinks.※The odors, if you ride I-94, you get this foul, rotten egg smell,§ said Sandra Turner-Handy, who lives about three miles from the facility.The 59-year-old said her son used to work a block away from the incinerator and said the smell was ※constant§. Her granddaughter developed asthma while attending a school near the incinerator, but hasn＊t used an inhaler since she graduated and moved away.The persistent odor and emission of other polluting substances are among 40 alleged Clean Air Act and state violations that have been logged against the company that owns the facility, Detroit Renewable Energy, since March 2015, according to a notice to sue by the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center.※It＊s the things that you can＊t smell that are the most harmful,§ said Turner-Handy. ※And how do residents report something that they can＊t smell?§In 2015, the incinerator burned more than 650,000 tons of garbage, according to the notice. And since the beginning of that year, the incinerator has been fined for persistently violating an earlier agreement with the state for alleged state violations.The law center also said in the filing that the incinerator presents a clear example of an environmental justice problem, as a majority of the trash burnt at the facility is imported from outlying communities, which pay $10 a ton less than Detroit to .※In short, Detroit is subsidizing other communities throughout the State of , the Midwest, and Canada to dispose of its garbage at the Incinerator,§ the filing said, with the incinerator ※located in a neighborhood that is composed mostly of low-income people of color and is heavily overburdened by air pollution§.There＊s a long-running debate over whether incineration is better for the environment than landfills. But communities located near incinerators have long lamented that they bear the brunt of its adverse impacts on air quality.Citing statistics from the EPA, the center said 7,280 residents live within one mile of the incinerator, of whom 60% live below the federal poverty line and 87% are people of color. An EPA report also found that the area is a ※hotspot for respiratory related health impacts when compared to other Michigan communities§, according to the law center.The notice to sue also names Michigan＊s governor, Rick Snyder, along with the state and federal environment agencies. The agencies have 60 days to commence an enforcement action, the law center said, and if neither pursues any, a lawsuit may be filed on behalf of residents to enforce the Clean Air Act.Detroit Renewable Energy, which  the facility provides energy to more than 140 buildings in the downtown and midtown neighborhoods, downplayed the litany of claims in the notice of intent.In a statement, the company said that it has invested approximately $6m over the last few years to ※improve odor management§ at the facility. The company said it employs nearly 300 residents, operates a ※sophisticated§ waste-to-energy facility, and ※places the highest priority on complying with the strict and complex requirements established by the EPA and the state environmental department.※In short, we have done our part,§ the company said. ※Any claim to the contrary would simply be false.§The law center says otherwise.Beyond odor, the notice of intent to sue also highlights an additional 19 violations for emitting carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter above legal thresholds. The incinerator creates a ※significant amount§ of particulate matter, said Nick Schroeck, executive director of the center, which ※can get lodged in people＊s lungs§.The incinerator can＊t be directly linked to cases of asthma, but the filing said ※particulate matter emissions have been shown to trigger asthma incidents, particularly amongst children§.Activists are pushing for a ballot initiative for November 2017 to close down the facility in favor of cleaner-energy-producing methods.※We initially approached this topic sort of by looking at what it was we could do that would be effective within the confines of city law, of state law, and how a ballot initiative could actually rectify a problem in the city,§ said Mac Farr, treasurer and spokesman for . ※And we could take a policy change and use it to both unify the city and also make the lives of Detroiters better. This was the topic that we settled on.§Farr said the group＊s motivations for the ballot initiative stem from the ※public health ramifications§ of the incinerator.※We have some of the highest rates of asthma [in Detroit], the highest that are clustered directly downwind of this incinerator,§ he said. ※It＊s four to five times the statewide average, and there＊s a public health dimension to this that needs to be addressed.§Farr said the group hopes the ballot petition will force city officials to examine the issue, but it has no clear solution for how Detroit should dispose of waste without an incinerator. He suggested a more ※robust, citywide recycling program§ could ※divert a lot of material out of the waste stream if we were to shut off incineration as a method of disposal§.Officials estimated earlier this year that  in the city are recycling.Dr Abdul El-Sayed, executive director and health officer at the Detroit health department, said issues surrounding the incinerator hadn＊t been on his department＊s radar until recently, but it＊s now ※very squarely on my plate§.※I think it＊s obvious that when you burn anything, it＊s going to produce material that goes up into the air. That material can do a number of hazardous things,§ El-Sayed said. ※I think it＊s clear that those things are not good for the lungs, and the eyes and some of the other organs ＃ the heart. It＊s, generally, not the cleanest, most efficient way of addressing the problem with garbage.§"

This would bring the total cumulative pre-tax charge relating to the Deepwater Horizon incident to $61.6bn, or $44bn after tax.The company said that any further outstanding claims related to the 2010 spill in the Gulf of Mexico left over ※will not have a material impact on the Group＊s financial performance§.

"Scientists are using 3D printing technology to create prosthetic coral that could be used to help the  recover from bleaching and storms.Researchers at the University of Sydney are creating virtual 3D maps of coral reefs to precisely model how their structure is altering as a result of environmental change.With her supervisor, associate professorWill Figueira, Dr Renata Ferrari established the Ecological 3D Modelling Hub to precisely quantify the structure of the delicate reef ecosystem.※The idea behind that was to map, monitor and model the coral reefs and other marine ecosystems in three dimensions,§ she said. ※If you can create a 3D map, then you can measure it, because you literally have a map of the corals on your computer. You can get anything you want out of it.§The technology is relatively new, based on photogrammetry: the science of making 3D reconstructions from photography. These virtual models are being used to print models of the coral that could be planted on the reef to give it support as it recovers from adverse events such as bleaching and storms.The 3D-printed coral would provide , as well as a structure on which developing coral can grow.Artificial reefs have been created with cinder blocks or deliberately sunk ships, said Ferrari, ※but we＊ve never had an artificial reef that resembles a natural reef structure§.※With the 3D-printed reefs, that＊s the main advantage. You＊re providing the exact same structure that an actualnatural reef provides, because we got the models from the reefs before they bleached. We are literally replicating it.§Having tested the 3D-printed corals＊ resilience in water, Ferrari hoped to plant some on the Great Barrier Reef this year. The extent of the operation and the number of sites depends on funding, though a pilot program would cost around $150,000. Ferrari was hopeful about the potential to save the Great Barrier Reef, she said, despite the doomsaying about its prospects. Though large parts of the northern end had died from sustained bleaching, the south was ※pretty much intact§.※Coral reefs have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years,§she said. ※Because of the connectivity of the Great Barrier Reef, this type of approach will still work. You put the reefs down and the coral larvae will arrive from other parts of the reef.§But, she warned, any local initiatives will be redundant if climate change 每 the number-one threat to reefs around the world 每 is not addressed at a global level.Mass bleaching brought on by increasing ocean temperatures, acidification caused by carbon emissions, and more frequent strong storms are ※smashing§ coral reefs on multiple fronts, said Ferrari.Without global policy to target the impacts of climate change, targeted initiatives such as the one she was proposing were essentially futile. ※But if carbon emissions are curbed ... local and regional interventions can have a huge, positive impact and effect on the health and resilience of the reef.※What local initiatives can do is buy the reef a little bit of time to recover.§"																																																			
"A UK travel company has pledged to stop promoting zoos and laid down guidelines for the kinds of animal facilities it will continue to work with.  said there was ※no justifiable reason§ to keep animals in captivity, in an announcement backed by the Born Free Foundation and actor and animal welfare campaigner Joanna Lumley.It gave four key reasons for its decision:So far, Responsible Travel has removed six trips from its site that include visits to zoos. It is also conducting an ※in-depth audit§ of all captive animal facilities visited on the trips it sells, which it says incorporates a significant proportion of the itineraries it offers around the world, to ensure they comply with its new guidelines.The site will still promote legitimate animal sanctuaries and rescue centres for animals that cannot be returned to the wild, as well as rehabilitation centres for animals that will be returned to the wild, as long as no captive breeding takes place in these facilities. It will also promote ※genuine endangered species conservation centres§.Responsible Travel, which works with 375 tour operators around the world, is the first travel company to make a strong statement regarding zoos, a move that comes as a growing number of tour operators are coming under pressure to take a stand against animal attractions.In February,  said it would no longer sell or promote any new attractions or hotels that featured captive whales and dolphins for entertainment purposes (though it continues to sell to around 30 attractions that currently do so), and last October  announced it would discontinue selling tickets for specific tourism experiences where travellers came into physical contact with captive wild animals, such as elephant rides, petting tigers and swimming with dolphins. In a  on the issue, Responsible Travel CEO Justin Francis said: ※Our conclusion is that zoos are not appropriate in 2017. They are relics of the past, and the arguments to justify keeping animals in captivity no longer stand up.§He added: ※In our view, rather than being self-proclaimed conservation organisations they are in fact businesses that exploit animals for profit.

"Chinese prosecutors have successfully sued a county environmental agency for inadequately punishing a sewage firm that produced dye without appropriate safeguards 每 the first such public interest case against a government department. The Supreme People＊s Procuratorate, China＊s top prosecutor, said prosecutors had successfully proved that an environmental protection department in Shandong province had committed ※illegal acts§ in its dealings with the Qingshun Chemical Technology Company. The case was filed in December 2015 in the Qingyun county court, with such departments coming under increasing scrutiny amid growing public discontent over pollution.

"The  was warned by its own experts that a car maker was suspected of cheating emissions tests five years before the VW emissions scandal.A documents cache seen by the Guardian show that the commission＊s in-house science service told it in 2010 that tests had uncovered what researchers suspected to be a ※defeat device§ that could cheat emissions tests.  using defeat device software that detected if a car was being driven under lab test conditions, and adjusted itself to reduce emissions of harmful nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution. Under real world conditions, the 11m VW cars affected had higher NOx emissions.The director of the EU＊s enterprise department claimed in April that the commission＊s science service, the Joint Research Centre (JRC), had failed in previous reports to flag up the risk of such defeat devices.But a report sent from the research centre to the directorate as far back as 2010 warned that its testing had found potential cheating by a car-maker. ※One vehicle tested showed extremely high NOx emissions during the low temperature type 6 test,§ it said. ※Since NOx emissions at low temperature are currently not regulated, this observation hints towards a very peculiar combustion strategy (defeat strategy?) the manufacturer applies at low temperature.§ The device kicked in immediately after the ※light off§ of the catalytic converters and involved an ※artificially lean combustion strategy reducing HC/CO (high hydrocarbon/CO2 output) but increasing NOx emissions§. It is not known which car maker was involved in the suspected test cheat but experts told the Guardian that the description bore the hallmarks of ,  used by numerous car manufacturers. According to the campaign group Transport and Environment, the programme turns off the cars＊ exhaust after-treatment systems at outside temperatures of about 17C. It has only recently been discovered and is already . JRC scientists told the European parliament＊s ＆dieselgate＊ inquiry that they were never given a mandate to investigate the defeat devices issue further.But a note from the EU＊s environment department (DG Envi) in 2010 said that work on ※defeat strategies§ was ※an important concern§ for them.In 2013, an air pollution study by the department warned of: ※Increasing evidence of illegal practices [by car manufacturers] that defeat the anti-pollution systems to improve driving performance or save on the replacement of costly components.§As such, the documents trawl, obtained by the Dutch environmental magazines Down to Earth and OneWorld and shared with the Guardian, casts serious doubt on the European commission＊s competence in handling the issue. Kathleen van Brempt, the chair of the dieselgate inquiry, said that the papers were ※shocking§ and raised questions about the future of commission officials.※These documents show that there has been an astonishing collective blindness to the defeat device issue in the European commission, as well as in other EU institutions,§ she told the Guardian.Seb Dance, the inquiry＊s coordinator, said that they ※completely contradict everything the commission has told us up to now about their having had no evidence of defeat strategies being used by car manufacturers.§In April, Daniel Calleja Crespo, the director of the EU＊s enterprise department, told the dieselgate inquiry that, despite being aware that vehicles＊ real-world NOx emissions were much higher than in test conditions, the commission ※did not see there was cheating going on§.But in November 2014, a year before the VW scandal, he had received a plea from DG Envi＊s then-director, Karl Falkenberg, for a response to his calls for an EU probe into defeat devices.※We continue to believe that DG Enterprise should investigate the regularity 每 and, if confirmed, demand corrective action 每 of certain current practices [in which] certain manufacturers deploy emission abatement techniques that are switched off at low temperatures or when the vehicle needs additional power,§ Falkenberg said.※This practice in our opinion goes beyond what is allowed by the Euro 5/6 [emissions test] legislation,§ he wrote in the letter. ※A request to look into this matter more deeply has remained unanswered so far.§Crespo did not answer it in his response. He said: ※Regarding the application of different strategies during the type-approval test and in real driving conditions, such practices are illegal in accordance to the European law and any manufacturer applying them would face severe legal consequences.§VW has yet to face any legal consequences for its use of defeat devices in Europe, despite . In Europe, legal actions are a matter for nation states.But experts say that the commission had the power and, arguably, a responsibility to alert member states to the defeat devices issue. It could also have informed its legal services department and contacted car manufacturers to ask whether their cars were causing a serious environmental problem that necessitated their recall.One letter released in the trawl, from the Dutch environment minister to the EU＊s industry commissioner in September 2015, says: ※We would like you to consider the possibilities of a European recall ＃ to ensure that all faulty software is removed from the market and replaced by proper software that allows proper emissions reduction.§※The commission should have alerted the member states＊ national supervisors,§ van Brempt said. ※Although it is not obliged, those states could have taken cars off the road, tested them and enforced the legislation.§Crespo did not respond to questions sent by the Guardian. In a twist to the tale, he displaced Falkenberg last September, and is now , after Karmenu Vella, the EU＊s commissioner for the environment.A commission spokesperson said that the bloc had known about the risk of defeat devices in 2014, but ※was not aware of any actual instances of fraud. We were just as shocked as everyone about the revelations of the Volkswagen emissions manipulation.§The official added that it was common knowledge that lab tests did not reflect real-world NOx emissions, which were up to 20 times higher, but that this could have been due to many factors. ※No concrete evidence on the use of defeat devices or of the failure of a member state to act was ever brought to the attention of the commission,§ she said.However, another EU source was less sanguine. ※The commission＊s position in this has been one of trying to avoid any responsibility,§ one told the Guardian.※Legally, the responsibility for enforcement of the legislation rests with member states. Whether the commission did enough to alert those states and ensure that they were carrying out their responsibilities is a very pertinent question.§"																																																			
"The coalition of rightwing politicians backing Brexit consists of climate change deniers, environmentalist cynics and no-holds-barred free-marketeers. For George Eustice to claim the UK＊s environment will be top of a list of priorities if Britain decides to leave the European Union is, frankly, ridiculous (, 31 May).The big environmental challenges the?UK faces 每 air pollution, catastrophic climate change, fish stocks, the hunting of migratory birds 每 do not respect national borders and can only be tackled?collectively.Our membership of the EU stops European countries engaging in a race to the bottom on environmental standards and gives us influence over our neighbours. One third of the dirty air affecting Londoners is blown in from farms across the Channel. If we left the EU, what legal redress would we be left with to stop them from doing this?Britain was once labelled the ※dirty man of Europe§. We spewed out the highest levels of acid-rain-causing sulphur dioxide across the EU, our beaches and rivers were awash with sewage, and the water we drank could often contain an alarming cocktail of harmful chemicals.European action has improved 9,000 miles of river, and the waters of 95% of British beaches are now safe enough to wade into. It has stopped the degradation of European forests by acid rain, and?it is now moving to tackle the air pollution crisis. Our membership of the EU has driven up environmental standards and given our country a vastly?cleaner bill of health. George＊s Eustice＊s description of the?EU＊s environmental policies as ※spirit-crushing§ is in itself spirit-crushing. Having lived for many years in Cornwall and witnessed the benefit of EU membership, I find it hard to accept his cavalier attitude and to trust that the environment would be safe in hands?such as his.The EU has given Cornwall the opportunity to develop in all areas. It is?one of the poorest areas in the UK and?has benefited greatly from the EU social fund; Objective One funding contributed ?350m from 2000 to 2006. This included the University of Cornwall (Tremough site).Thanks to the EU, Cornish beaches were cleaned up too. Maybe our busy farmer＊s son never had the pleasure of building sandcastles, hence his destructive, shortsighted comments. I had to smile when I received a Friends of the Earth email asking me to vote remain because of the benefits of EU controls on air quality and 80,000 deaths a year because of low air quality. Fair point. Except that the EU is responsible for the plague of air pollution caused by the catastrophic switch to diesel in pursuit of lower CO emissions.I agree that we should remain in the EU, but feel that remainers should argue?for better democratic scrutiny of EU laws as part of a remain deal. I conclude (since the dangers of diesel have been known for decades) that EU legislative processes could do well to emulate the UK＊s, for example, in their beneficially tortuous exposure to scrutiny as they pass into law.The EU＊s control of wattage on vacuum cleaners is another case in point. Progressive reduction in power consumption will create the need to use?vacuum cleaners for longer to remove a similar amount of dirt.A more vigorous legislative process could never have acceded to a pro-diesel transport policy. Anyone who has visited one of America＊s large cities, little afflicted by diesel, will know how dramatically better their air is than in any of Europe＊s capitals. To obtain the option of reducing VAT on heating oil is an absurd argument for leaving the EU (, theguardian.com, 31 May), because it would be reckless and damaging to use that option. Any reduction in tax on fossil fuel would encourage more consumption of fossil fuel, just when the world needs to decrease it.If the British government wanted to help poor people cope with heating costs (which of course it doesn＊t), it could do that equally well by increasing welfare benefits for the poor 每 enough to cover what they typically pay in VAT on heating oil. (Or even more; their lives are hard, after all.) For the poor, this would be equivalent to eliminating the VAT on oil, while everyone else would still pay the tax. All, rich and poor alike, would still feel this small extra incentive to use?less fuel. This option, permitted by EU rules as far as I know, would be better in every way."																																																			
"Great white sharks are swimming toward the waters off  in rising numbers, scientists say, after a second consecutive year showing an increase in predators to Cape Cod.The latest data from a multiyear study of the ocean predators found that the number of sharks in waters off the vacation haven appeared to be on the rise, said Greg Skomal, a senior scientist with the Massachusetts division of marine fisheries, and the state＊s top shark expert.The sharks are after seals, not humans, and towns are using the information from the study to keep it that way. ※How long does it stay and where does it go are the questions we＊re trying to answer,§ Skomal said. ※But for the towns, it＊s a public safety issue.§Researchers using a plane and boats spotted 147 individual white sharks last summer. That was up slightly from 2015, but significantly more than the 80 individual sharks spotted in 2014, the first year of the study, funded by the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy.More than half the white sharks spotted last summer had not previously been documented by this study.Researchers have also tagged more than 100 to track their movements.The white shark population was probably significantly larger, because the scientists could not possibly spot all of them, Skomal said.Two of the more interesting findings are the increasing number of young sharks, and that they appear to be swimming farther afield.※Last summer, we saw greater numbers of smaller sharks, including juveniles, and that tells us that the population is rebuilding,§ Skomal said.Great whites, made famous in the 1975 movie Jaws, about a monstrous shark that terrorizes a fictional New England resort town, journey to Cape Cod waters every year to feast on seals. Once hunted to near extinction, the now protected seals have rebounded in great numbers.The seals used to be concentrated at the Monomoy wildlife refuge, off limits to humans, but as they have moved farther north, so have the sharks, Skomal said.The risk of a swimmer being attacked by a shark is minimal. Cape Cod towns would like to ensure that continues to be the case.The last documented fatal great white shark attack in Massachusetts waters was in 1936, Skomal said. In 2012, a man bitten while swimming off Truro required 47 stitches and surgery to repair damaged tendons. In 2014, two young women kayaking off Plymouth were attacked, although neither was bitten.Nathan Sears, the natural resources manager in Orleans, said the study was invaluable and was already prompting changes in how the town managed its beaches.The town used to fly dangerous marine life flags with a picture of shark on them only when they knew there was a shark in the area. Now, he said, the town flew the flag every day during the tourist season.※The fact that they have an eye on the situation from the air is crucial,§ he said. ※And if they spot a shark in the swimming area, we＊ll close the beach.§"																																																			
"A woman whose daughter died from an asthma attack wants an investigation to find out whether worsening air pollution in  contributed to the death.Ella Kissi-Debrah, nine, from Hither Green near the capital＊s busy south circular road, died in February 2013. Through a lawyer, her mother, Rosamund, is calling on the attorney general to order a second inquest or to set up an independent inquiry to determine the impact of pollution on her child＊s asthma and death. She is also calling for immediate action to reduce exposure to toxic air for children such as her son, Robert, whose lives she believes, remain at risk.The moves could pave the way for ground-breaking legal action against the Greater London Authority and other government bodies for failing to protect her child and others from air pollution.Jocelyn Cockburn, a human rights lawyer who is working with the family, said: ※There are strong grounds to believe that our government may be in breach of its duty to protect life in Ella＊s case.§Concern is growing about air pollution in London, , behind Paris, Berlin and Chicago. According to City Hall, almost 10,000 Londoners die every year because of polluted air and the capital does not meet the legal requirements for pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide.  showed that London has breached safe levels of pollutant particles known as PM10.Kissi-Debrah attended Holbeach primary in Lewisham. She died suddenly, having suffered several seizures following coughing fits which resulted in her being treated in hospital. In a narrative conclusion, the original coroner, Phillip Barlow, ruled that Ella had suffered a severe asthma attack followed by a seizure.※Three years after Ella＊s tragic death there are still unanswered questions about why she died,§ said Cockburn. ※The inquest did not identify the cause of Ella＊s asthma and the pathologist confirmed that this was unknown although he suggested that it may be an allergic reaction to an inhaled antigen from something in the air. What is striking is that the issue of air pollution has been overlooked both in the inquest and, so far as the family is aware, in the ongoing child death review into Ella＊s death by Lewisham council.§She added: ※Article 2 of the Human Rights Act requires government bodies to take reasonable steps to protect those such as Ella from the effects of air pollution if they are aware, or should be, that it poses a real and immediate risk to their lives. There is now ample evidence that air pollution does pose a risk to life 每 in fact it causes around 9,500 early deaths in London per year. We also know that the air in many parts of London, as well as cities beyond, is so dirty that we have been in breach of EU air quality limits since 2010.§If it is proved that air pollution played a significant role in Kissi-Debrah＊s death, it could trigger a compensation claim and a legal challenge to force government bodies to take immediate steps to curb pollution.In a statement, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ※I would like to extend my condolences to Ella＊s friends and family. Her death is truly tragic. I am determined to get to grips with air quality, something that has not been a high enough priority until now. I was elected with a mandate to tackle London＊s dangerously polluted air and make sure that breathing clean air is a right, not a privilege.§In one of his first acts as mayor, Khan launched a consultation on  to the north and south circular roads and the possibility of bringing forward the introduction from 2020. He also published a report that was , which showed that schools in the poorest areas of the capital experienced the worst pollution."																																																			
"Environmental crews worked on Saturday to contain a sheen of oil that appeared in the Columbia river along the Washington-Oregon border after . Officials said there was no immediate indication of harm to wildlife.Sixteen of the 96 tank cars on the train derailed on Friday near Mosier, , about 70 miles east of Portland. Four burned, sending a thick plume of black smoke into the sky before firefighters were able to extinguish the flames a little after 2am on Saturday. No injuries were reported.There was no immediate word on the cause of the derailment, which forced the evacuation of about 100 people from a nearby mobile home park, as the site remained too hot to examine. Officials said they would consider lifting the evacuation order on Saturday evening.※I want to apologize to the community,§ Union Pacific spokeswoman Raquel Espinoza said at a news conference, adding that the company would pick up the tab for the response costs. ※This is the type of accident we work to prevent every day.§The derailment, in the scenic Columbia River Gorge, manifested the fears of environmentalists who have long argued against shipping oil by rail 每 especially through populated areas or along a river that is a hub of recreation and commerce. The tank cars were carrying especially volatile crude from the Northern Plains＊ Bakken region, which has a higher gas content and vapor pressure than other types of oil.More than 100 people rallied and marched in nearby Hood River, Oregon, on Saturday to call for a halt to the practice. Emily Reed, the city council president in Mosier, joined them.In a telephone interview, Reed said her son was evacuated from school because of the derailment. Her husband, a firefighter, was a first responder. The family evacuated their house and her father was unable to ship the first crop from his small cherry orchard.※I＊ve just listed four major risks that I have, and I don＊t see the benefit I＊m getting in exchange for this risk,§ Reed said. ※There is no safe way for these fossil fuel trains to come through our town, and I＊d like to see them stopped until there are standards and we know it＊s safe.※This isn＊t a one-off. It＊s happening in my town, but next time it＊ll be somebody else＊s town.§At first light on Saturday, crews noticed a light sheen in the Columbia at the mouth of Rock Creek. Responders deployed about 1,000ft of boom to contain it. It wasn＊t clear how much oil had spilled from the trains.By Saturday afternoon, three of the cars had been re-railed. Crews had been waiting for the cars to cool before transferring the oil into tank trucks.Union Pacific officials said on Saturday the company had inspected the section of track where the derailment occurred at least six times since 21 March. It was most recently checked last Tuesday, and within the past month the company had used checked for imperfections and inspected the ground along the track.To get to refineries on the east and west coasts and the Gulf of Mexico, oil trains move through more than 400 counties, including major metropolitan areas such as Philadelphia, Seattle, Chicago, Newark, New Jersey and dozens of other cities, according to railroad disclosures filed with regulators.Including Friday＊s incident, at least 26 oil trains have been involved in major fires or derailments during the past decade in the US and Canada, according to Associated Press analysis of accident records from the two countries.The worst was a 2013 derailment that killed 47 people in Lac-Megantic, Quebec. Damage from that accident has been estimated at $1.2bn or higher. At least 12 of the oil trains that derailed over the past decade were carrying crude from the Bakken region. Of those, eight resulted in fires.Since last spring, North Dakota regulators have required companies to treat oil before it＊s shipped by rail to make it less combustible.Reducing the explosiveness of the crude moved by rail was not supposed to be a cure-all to prevent accidents. Department of Transportation rules imposed last year require companies to use stronger tank cars that are better able to withstand derailments.The tank cars that derailed in Oregon were newer model CPC-1232s, said Union Pacific spokesman Justin Jacobs. Critics say the upgraded models still are not safe enough to transport volatile Bakken oil."																																																			
"The UN＊s climate chief has been unable to secure a meeting with the US state department as Donald Trump＊s administration mulls whether to withdraw the US from the international climate effort.Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is currently in the US and has sought a meeting with , the secretary of state, and other officials over the commitment of the new administration to global climate goals.However, Espinosa said she had not had a response to her request and a state department official said there were no scheduled meetings to announce.The official added: ※As with many policies, this administration is conducting a broad review of international climate issues.§Former US secretaries of state haven＊t always met directly with the head of the UNFCCC, with meetings often conducted by the US climate envoy, a position currently vacant. However, the lack of response to Espinosa, the former foreign minister of Mexico, is unusual even given the nascency of the new administration.※I don＊t think it＊s a good sign 每 it＊s a snub,§ said Maria Ivanova, a global governance expert at the University of Massachusetts. ※Patricia Espinosa has been very gracious about this and she understands what it is like to be a foreign minister. But not responding to the executive secretary is not good manners.§During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to ※cancel§ the  and stop all American payment to UN global warming programs. His administration＊s stated aim is to slash payments to countries threatened by rising seas, crop failures and heatwaves.Following his election win, Trump  about the Paris deal while Tillerson has insisted that the US should have a ※seat at the table§ in climate talks without specifying exactly what America＊s role should be.There are elements within the administration pushing for a rapid exit from the international climate forum. Quitting the Paris deal, in which 196 nations pledged to keep the global temperature rise to below 2C, would take four years in total. But exiting the UNFCCC itself would provide a faster route, at about a year, and this approach has , a lawyer at the conservative Heritage Foundation, who was part of Trump＊s state department landing team.This stance has been countered by a group that  Ivanka Trump, the president＊s daughter, and her husband, the Trump adviser Jared Kushner. The duo are understood to have convinced Trump to not include language critical of the Paris agreement in a forthcoming executive order. Dozens of large businesses, , have also urged Trump to stick with the Paris deal. ※There seems to be a debate within the administration about this and it＊s clear there are some voices who understand that withdrawing from Paris would have significant diplomatic repercussions,§ said David Waskow, director of the international climate initiative at the World Resources Institute. ※Economically, it would also send the unfortunate signal that the US isn＊t at the forefront of clean energy technology. There are plenty of reasons to stay within the agreement.§While Trump has previously dismissed the science of global warming, the potential loss of American prestige and international influence could prove key in keeping the US involved in climate talks. Climate is a top line issue in forums such as the G7 and G20 and China has already signaled that it will seek to move into a leadership position should the US pull back. Other countries may even exact punitive measures in response to American withdrawal from the effort to maintain a habitable planet. ※Those countries with high ambitions for Paris may impose border adjustment tariffs on the US, which would dramatically increase the prospect of a global trade war,§ said John Sterman, director of MIT＊s system dynamics group. ※That is something that would be very unhelpful.※If we withdraw from Paris or the UNFCCC, we make it much harder to limit the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. That would create a huge flow of refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere who will look to go to the US and Europe. There won＊t be a wall big enough to keep out people fleeing floods and crop failures.§Greenhouse gas emissions cuts pledged by countries at the Paris talks are still insufficient to keep the planet to the 2C warming limit. The world would still be on a pathway to a , temperature increase by the end of the century, which would accelerate sea level rise, trigger food and water insecurity and threaten whole ecosystems such as coral reefs."																																																			
"Stagnant air from continental Europe, which has picked up pollution from industry and agriculture, is being blown over the UK from the south-east. This air combines with pollutants already present in the air from UK sources, such as nitrogen oxides and particulates from diesel vehicle engines, to produce air pollution. This is resulting in ※moderate§ levels of pollutants known as PM10 and PM2.5, which are tiny particulates that can lodge in the lungs and  in vulnerable people. , is also present at elevated levels.As the wind is blowing these pollutants inland, ※moderate§ levels of pollution are likely to occur not just in their usual locations, close to busy roads, but also far beyond, according to a warning from King＊s College .Vulnerable people 每 including those with existing respiratory conditions, children, older people and people with other health problems, such as heart disease 每 should take care, and avoid strenuous exercise outdoors if they experience breathing difficulties.As the pollution is so widespread, it is difficult to avoid. Staying indoors can help, as can cutting out car journeys and paying attention to your body. If you feel short of breath, or develop a cough, sore throat or irritated eyes, then cut out strenuous physical activity and rest inside.The  is for moderate pollution to hang over large parts of England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland until Monday. The worst day is expected to be Sunday, when people are likely to head outdoors due to the balmy weather. Sunday will see high levels of pollution in some parts of the country.Air pollution is an increasingly high profile problem in the UK, despite the government＊s obligations to cut pollution to safe levels, agreed under EU rules. These rules have been flouted for years, to the point where earlier this year the number of high pollution days allowed under the regulations was  in some parts of London. The government faces fines from the EU and legal  over its failures.In other cities 每 such as , Athens and Milan 每 the local authorities have moved on days of high pollution to curb the use of cars in city centres and surrounding areas. But the government and City Hall, both Tory-led, have refused to do so.The government says it has a plan to cut pollution to legal levels by 2025. This is five years too late according to the rules it has signed up to, and ., such as low-emissions zones, more cycling routes and changes to public transport to bring in cleaner vehicles.Shortness of breath, streaming eyes, coughing and respiratory difficulties are common in the first instance.

"A new paper shows that the ancient ancestors of termites found in northern Australia crossed vast distances over oceans, and then followed an evolutionary path similar to humans, migrating from tree-tops to the ground.Mounds sometimes reaching as high as eight metres and housing millions of individual insects are seen in the , Western Australia and far north Queensland, built by cathedral termites. Relative to the animals＊ 3mm height and the average human height the termite mounds are the equivalent to four of the world＊s tallest structure, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, stacked on top of each other.Little was known about the termites＊ origins until this research, said Associate Professor Nathan Lo, the co-lead author of the paper from the University of Sydney.DNA sequencing showed that today＊s cathedral termites descend from the first ※nasute termites§ to arrive in Australia up to 20m years ago from Asia or South America.※It＊s a strange result but we＊re very confident about it,§ said Lo. ※The closest relatives of these mound-building termites in Australia are actually tree-nesting termites that live in Asia and South America.§He believed that termites arrived in Australia after crossing long distances of ocean on plant matter following tsunamis or large storm events. The researchers found this colonisation had happened three times in the past 20m years.These first settlers also lived in trees in coastal areas but over time began to build mounds on the ground and feed on litter and grass as they adapted to the arid conditions of northern Australia.Lo said the termites＊ relocation was driven by change in climate and environment after Australia shifted from a forest-covered continent 20m years ago to a much drier landscape.As the forests succumbed to Australia＊s dry conditions about seven to 10m years ago, the tree-dwelling termites sought more moisture in the earth, he said. ※That＊s why they started to build mounds.§Humans would later follow a similar evolutionary path, said Lo, with our ancestors living in trees as recently as the last 4m years.※These amazing mounds we see in the north of Australia, we didn＊t know if they were 100m years old, 50m years old. Now we know it＊s more likely that within the last 10m years that they＊ve popped up.※They weren＊t here when Australia separated from Gondwana some 100m years ago 每 they evolved here relatively recently due to ancient climate change.§The study, published on Wednesday in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, was led by the University of Sydney in collaboration with Purdue University in the United States, the CSIRO National Research Collections Australia, the University of  and the University of New South Wales."																																																			
"Over 1,000 old landfill sites on the coasts of England and  are at increasing risk of being breached by erosion, according to a new study, posing a serious pollution danger to wildlife and bathing waters.Landfill sites before the mid-1990s had few or no restrictions about what rubbish could be dumped in them and little is known about what they contain. But many were on the coast and some were used to raise land levels and even as part of flood defences. Climate change is bringing higher sea levels and stronger storms, putting the old dumps at greater risk of being broken up.The new study, the first of its kind and funded by the , assessed two landfill sites in Essex to find out the level of toxic pollutants in the waste they contained. It found large quantities of harmful metals, such as lead, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are carcinogenic.※Our findings show, that in the event of erosion, there would be serious environmental consequences due to the level of contaminants,§ said , who led the research. ※You would be likely to see significant effects on local animals and plants, from mortality to reductions in fertility. There would also be consequences for bathing waters.§There are 1,264 historic landfill sites in the coastal zone where the risk of flooding has been previously estimated at 1-in-200 years. Of these, 537 are in or near bathing water catchment areas and 406 are in or near sites of special scientific interest.With the predicted increase in sea level, extreme weather events and coastal erosion due to climate change, a national survey of the old landfill sites is urgently needed, said Spencer: ※Nationally we need a much better inventory of sites that have eroded or are at risk of eroding - that is the priority.§The scientists dug pits to investigate the contents of two sites in Essex: Leigh Marshes landfill, used from 1955-1967, and Hadleigh Marsh Landfill, used from 1980-1987. In the latter, which is used as a flood embankment, the researchers estimated there is 9,250kg of lead, 985kg of PAHs and 125kg of cadmium, among the 77,000 tonnes of waste.The analysis found that all of the Leigh Marsh waste samples and 63% of the Hadleigh Marsh samples contained contaminants at concentrations that are above marine sediment quality guidelines, meaning that damaging effects to wildlife could be expected if the waste were to erode into surrounding wetlands.Spencer warned that conclusions about other sites are hard to draw from these examples: ※Many landfills were in use when there were no rules about what went in [so] every landfill is essentially unique and some will prove more risky than others.§ by the sea would expose the dumps to salt water, which the research found was much more effective at leaching pollutants from the rubbish than freshwater. But the team expect this would be less damaging than the landfills being broken up by erosion as the pollutants would be filtered by sediments.The assessment of the risk posed by old coastal landfills is made more urgent by the fact that some parts of the coast, including Hadleigh Marsh, are being considered for ※managed retreat§. This is where maintaining defences is not seen as cost-effective and the sea is allowed to flood an area, as happened at .The study suggests relocating the waste would be ideal but the costs of this would be so enormous that managed retreat is unlikely where historic landfills are present.An  spokeswoman said: ※The risk of these landfills being affected by coastal erosion and rising sea levels remains low for the foreseeable future. This research will ensure ourselves, and local authorities, continue to have robust shoreline plans in place to help tackle any potential risks from erosion in future years.§Essex County Council is responsible for the management and monitoring of the two sites analysed in the new study. Councillor Mick Page said: ※The council and partners have developed the Essex and Suffolk Shoreline Management Plan and, subject to adequate finances being secured, it is the intention to establish survey stations and undertake regular monitoring in the future to inform future management decisions.§Some old landfills have already been breached by erosion, such as one at East Tilbury, which attracted amateur collectors. ※They were rummaging through this 75-year-old waste,§ said Spencer. ※I exercise caution. I wouldn＊t pick the waste up or handle it.§"

Last week we were granted permission to  每 because its new plan still isn＊t nearly good enough.Air pollution across the UK continues to threaten people＊s health, and children are some of the first to suffer. Research by King＊s College London suggests the  living in London has been reduced by living or going to school near main roads. These children have an increased risk of disease such as asthma and bronchitis and face the prospect of a permanent reduction in lung capacity.In February, a report from the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health set out in more detail the . The report suggests that long-term exposure to air pollution has a wide range of adverse effects in childhood, and can also affect the development of foetuses. Exposure in early life also increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes in later life. The report linked air pollution to 40,000 deaths a year.It should therefore be no surprise that two out of three parents , according to a YouGov survey of parents in London, commissioned by ClientEarth.Londoners are also concerned about the threat of air pollution to their own health. Our poll reveals that they believe air pollution is the biggest health threat they face as a result of living in the capital. They have also sent a clear message to whoever becomes the next mayor that they expect them to clean up the capital＊s dirty air. Three-quarters of Londoners think the mayor has a .How do we do that? We need a clear commitment to strengthening and expanding (ULEZ) as soon as possible, to protect the health of everyone who lives and works in the capital. This will mean the dirtiest vehicles will be removed from the most-polluted areas. The current ULEZ would only cover the same area as the current congestion charging zone, and isn＊t expected to come into force until September 2020.The mayor should also restrict access to the ULEZ to those vehicles that meet the most stringent emission standards when driving on London＊s roads, not just in . We need real-world emission labelling to help inform consumers and hold car companies to account.We also need action from the UK government, starting with a more ambitious air quality strategy, as current and planned policies will not deliver compliance with air quality limits in London .The government should also consider fiscal incentives such as changes to vehicle excise duty and a targeted diesel scrappage scheme to take the dirtiest vehicles off the road.Finally, the mayor needs to work with the EU to ensure that new air pollution legislation protects Londoners rather than heavily polluting industries. The current mayor has sat back and watched while the national government has worked  每 the Euro 6 regulation of vehicle emissions, for example, which fatally undermines the ULEZ. If the UK were to leave the EU, air quality standards would be weaker and more difficult to enforce.All the main mayoral candidates claim they are committed to tackling the issue and have announced a range of policies in their manifestos. But the key policy for cleaning up London＊s dirty air is a bigger and better ULEZ. of the Liberal Democrats and  of the Greens have set out very ambitious policies proposing to expand and strengthen the zone and bring forward the implementation of the policy to 2018 or 2019 (Sian Berry would replace the congestion charge and low-emission zones with a smart road-charging system, while Pidgeon would ban all diesel vehicles within an expanded ULEZ by 2024).Zac Goldsmith and Sadiq Khan also support changes to the ULEZ policy but have been less specific about what those changes would be. They will need to increase their ambition if they are serious about protecting the health of Londoners. They must come up with proper plans that will reduce air pollution as soon as possible, so we are not breathing illegal levels of pollution for another decade or more.We need to begin the phase out of the dirtiest diesel cars as soon as possible and rapidly move to cleaner and greener vehicles with zero emissions in central London. This will make our capital not only the most exciting city on earth, but also the cleanest."																																																			
"A Conservative cabinet minister has made a direct plea to supporters of other political parties to vote in favour of Britain＊s membership of the EU by warning that  would be a ※hugely retrograde step§ for the environment.In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the environment secretary, , said the referendum was too important to be dominated by internal Tory politics. argued that the EU was responsible for major global breakthroughs such as the dramatic reduction in the levels of acid rain and reducing the hole in the world＊s ozone layer. The fact that the UK shared its air and oceans with European countries, and that 80% of birds migrated across borders, meant that continued collaboration was essential, she added.※What would I say to readers of the Guardian is that this isn＊t just a debate in the Conservative party 每 that is for me a very small part of it. This is a debate about our country. People who care about those issues, who care about us being an outward-facing, internationally-focused country, go out and vote,§ said Truss.The minister singled out the Labour party, urging its voters not to let the controversy engulfing it distract them from the ※vital decision on §. ※This is bigger than party politics,§ she added. It came as Truss faced criticism from Eurosceptic MPs after signing up to a declaration with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the former Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey and the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, describing Brexit campaigners as ※extreme and outdated§.Miliband said the four had put together an unprecedented partnership in order to fight for the environment. They published a pamphlet that accused leave campaigners of dismissing vital green policies and climate change as ※mumbo jumbo§, and said EU collaboration was the only hope in tackling global warming.But Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP who chairs Vote Leave, accused Truss and others of ※descending into absurdity§. ※It seems there is no good in the world that they cannot somehow attribute to the EU and no imagined disaster they cannot predict if we vote leave.§But Truss told the Guardian that she believed working with countries that were closest geographically was key, not least because industrial operations across  were causing pollution in the UK.※We share our air. Up to 50% of all particulate matter in UK air comes from the European continent,§ she said. ※It is a classic tragedy of the commons: you produce pollution but you are not feeling the full effect of it so that is why we need to work together.§She claimed that membership of the EU had helped shore up depleted stocks of fish such as cod; cleaned up the sea and beaches; helped reduce the illegal trade of ivory and rhino horns; and contributed to tackling animal disease.She also said it was responsibly for cutting sulphur dioxide levels by 94% leading to the ※end of the threat of acid rain, which was destroying forests and historic buildings§. Truss said that Margaret Thatcher＊s push for the Montreal protocol had helped address the hole in the ozone layer. She claimed that membership of the EU magnified Britain＊s global influence. ※When you are speaking for 500 million people that really carries weight.§The environment secretary also claimed that farmers would be ※much better off remaining in a reformed EU§, a view that contradicts George Eustice, who is not just a Conservative colleague but the farming minister within her own department. He recently  a survey by Farmers Weekly that found 58% of farmers would vote for Brexit, while 31% wanted to see Britain remain in the EU. ※It is no surprise that farmers want to leave the EU. Virtually every problem they bring to me is a direct consequence of dysfunctional EU rules and regulations,§ said Eustice, who is a prominent out campaigner.He also challenged the latest collaboration with Miliband, saying Brexit would allow Britain to regain control. Truss would not comment on Eustice personally but said farmers benefited from common rules and said trade in the food industry was worth billions, with Europe the easiest market to reach.※If you look at export products like beef or lamb to the US we are still not in that market 20 years later.§She said the key debate was over what sort of country Britain wanted to be. §That is a really important question rather than what is happening in the Conservative party... It doesn＊t matter what party people vote for.§Sam Lowe, of Friends of the Earth, welcomed the intervention saying that climate change affected everyone, regardless of their political affiliation.But a Vote Leave spokesman accused Truss of ※losing all sense of perspective§, and asked why she believed the British government would be unwilling protect the environment in a post-Brexit world. ※Tackling climate change is a global challenge yet we have allowed our voice at international institutions to be diminished by our EU membership ...

", Gumtree and eBay have refused to ban adverts for a service which removes crucial pollution filters from the exhausts of diesel cars, sending toxic emissions soaring.Over a thousand diesel car owners have already been caught after removing the filter, though experts warn the problem may be far more widespread.Campaigners are now complaining to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that such adverts break its code, which bans motoring ※practices that condone or encourage anti-social behaviour§. The service exploits a loophole in the law which means that driving a diesel car without a filter is an offence, but the act of removing it is not.Air pollution is a ※§, MPs said this week and particulate pollution causes 40,000 to 50,000 early deaths every year in the UK. But garages across the country are offering to remove diesel particulate filters (DPF), a practice ministers have labelled .DPF filters can become clogged, especially for diesels driven mostly in cities, and replacement can be expensive, leading garages to offer to remove the filters completely. Google and Gumtree say they accept the adverts for the service because removal itself is not illegal.Since 2014, cars missing DPF filters automatically fail the MOT test and, earlier this month, the Guardian revealed that  so far. But some garages boast on their websites that they can beat the visual MOT check.Friends of the Earth (FoE) is now complaining to the ASA over adverts for DPF removal services. Oliver Hayes, at FoE said: ※Air pollution is a public health crisis of breath-taking proportions. We＊re asking the ASA to clamp down on those advertising these dubious practices and help prevent more deadly pollution hitting our children＊s lungs.§※But we＊re also calling on the government to make it illegal to remove these pollution filters in the first place,§ he said. ※Unless they do, the absurd loophole remains.§The House of Commons  and its chair, Mary Creagh MP, said: ※The removal of DPF filters by rogue garages is another diesel test dodge which cheats the public out of clean air. The Department of Transport did the right thing in introducing visual checks into MOTs. But it should now look at tightening up MOTs and outlawing the removal of pollution filters altogether.§※Our changes to the MOT test are helping cut harmful emissions and are taking hundreds of polluting vehicles out of circulation,§ said a spokesman for the Department for Transport. ※We are also investigating the latest technology so garages can carry out tougher, smarter tests that will act as a deterrent and keep these cars off the road.§Google said it did not comment on individual cases and declined to take down DPF removal adverts. A spokeswoman said: ※Our policies require advertisers to comply with all applicable laws and local regulations.

"Thousands of people are dying each year because of the government＊s failure to tackle food poisoning, health and safety breaches and pollution, a thinktank is warning.A new report from the  claims that lax regulation and weak enforcement are failing to hold businesses in check and are tantamount to state-facilitated ※social murder§.The report, by Professor Steve Tombs, head of social policy and criminology at the Open University, claims that some 29,000 deaths in the UK are attributable to . A further 50,000 people die as a result of injuries or health problems originating in the workplace. Each year  results in 20,000 people being hospitalised and 500 deaths.While stressing that the figures are probably underestimates, the report claims that many of the deaths would be largely avoidable if the government promoted a more robust regulatory environment.It argues that successive governments have undermined the independent inspection of businesses over many years, with damaging consequences for public health. A typical business can now expect a local authority health and safety inspection just once every 20 years, the report points out. Between 2004 and 2013, there were 34% fewer  and 28% fewer prosecutions; 53% fewer health and safety inspections and 40% fewer prosecutions; and 56% fewer environmental health inspections and 40% fewer prosecutions.※This is not about rules, regulations and red tape,§ Tombs said. ※It is about lives lost and shortened and the health of communities, workers and consumers made poorer. This is avoidable business-generated, state-facilitated social murder. And quite remarkably it proceeds daily, met largely by political silence.§A shift towards self-regulation and the use of private firms to carry out regulatory work once overseen by public bodies are blamed for a softening of the regulatory environment. Research by the  has found that 44% of local government expenditure on environmental and regulatory services now goes to external contractors, resulting in what Tombs suggests is ※the transformation of a system of social protection which, for all of its limitations, has existed in the UK since the 1830s§.He cites the  and other car manufacturers and the recent furore over  as evidence that businesses ※cannot simply be trusted to act in the public interest without robust, independent, state-backed regulation§.The report＊s publication comes amid heightened concern over the government＊s commitment to tackling environmental health issues.Last week the Commons environment committee attacked the government for . It warned that 40,000-50,000 premature deaths a year in the UK were caused by a failure to adequately tackle cardiac, respiratory and other diseases linked to air pollution. It called for clean air zones 每 currently being introduced in London, Leeds, Birmingham, Nottingham, Derby and Southampton, targeting drivers of high-polluting vehicles 每 to be extended to more cities in England.Will McMahon, deputy director of the CCJS, said that tackling public health issues was not being made a sufficient priority because it was an easy target for cutbacks.※The public is led to believe the greatest harms faced by citizens are dealt with by the police and courts,§ McMahon said. ※Professor Tombs makes clear that this is far from the case. The harms he writes about are not random happenings but the result of political and economic decisions. Policymakers need to urgently address the radical reduction in local authority inspections and enforcement.§A spokesman for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the government was committed to improving public health.※Improving air quality is a priority for this government and that is why last year we published plans setting out a new programme of clean air zones which, alongside national action to encourage uptake of low emission vehicles and continued investment in clean technologies, will create cleaner, healthier air for all.§"																																																			
"Australia＊s official greenhouse gas data, showing a continued increase in emissions, was quietly published on a government website on Friday, after internal government correspondence showed it had been held back from release for more than a month.The figures broadly confirm  by consultants at NDEVR Environmental, published last month. Those projections proved about 98% accurate, with emissions rising by even more than was projected.The government also updated all its historical data, showing emissions going back to at least 2001 were higher than previously thought, with most of these revisions due to gas leaks from the mining sector 每 fugitive emissions.The data still remains one quarter behind, and the NDEVR-Guardian analysis published in June projected an unseasonal rise in emissions not seen in more than a decade for that quarter 每 the first three months of this year.The government release covers emissions up to December 2016 and confirms that they have continued to rise. The new figures for 2016 show emissions rose 1% over the new estimation of 2015 emissions 每 but that was a rise of 1.7% compared with the government＊s previous estimation of 2015 figures.The rise is in line with government projections, which show that on current policies, emissions will continue to rise to 2030 and beyond.But they are in stark contrast to to Australia＊s international commitments made as part of the Paris agreement, which now state that emissions will fall to at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2030. Australia has also committed to ratchet up that ambition over time, in line with the goal of keeping global warming to ※well below 2C§.Most of the increase in emissions occurred in the ※stationary energy§ sector 每 which includes fuels used for heating and energy besides electricity generation 每 as well as in fugitive emissions. .The figures were released on the same day the Australian Conservation Foundation  it obtained under freedom of information laws showing that the government had been sitting on the release for more than a month.After the information was released, the federal minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, tweeted a link to the report, pointing out that emissions from the electricity sector had dropped in the last quarter covered by the report. Emissions from the electricity sector almost always fall in the December quarter, but the NDEVR-Guardian projections suggest they rose dramatically in the quarter to March 2017, which is very unusual. Those figures are yet to be released by the government.The climate scientist Will Steffen, a member of the Climate Council, said Australia＊s rising emissions were an embarrassment.※This is clear evidence that Australia is failing to tackle climate change compared to superpowers like the United States, whose emissions fell last year, and China, which has peaked its emissions more than a decade earlier than it promised in Paris,§ he said.※In contrast, Australia＊s lack of an effective climate and energy policy has now led to even higher emission levels while the big global emitters begin to reduce carbon pollution.§"																																																			
"Readers of this column know that I tend to focus on breaking science in the climate and energy areas. Sometimes, I stray into politics and other times, I venture further afield. Today, on Earth Day, I was reflecting on best ways to move real action forward and it is clear to me, and almost everyone in this industry, that building bridges between like-minded groups is key. Frankly, it isn＊t just scientists that are concerned about climate change. Our concerns are shared by business leaders, the insurance industry, defense industries, people who enjoy the outdoors, farmers, and many more. Recently, there has been a movement amongst persons of faith as well. In fact, for some people of faith, taking care of the Earth is a mandate from a higher authority. In this light, and to celebrate a very different voice form my own, the following is a guest post by a well-known meteorologist in the USA, Paul Douglas. It turns out he is also a man of faith as well as a business leader. Thanks Paul.-John AbrahamChristians just celebrated the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I＊m a Christian, husband, father, businessman and scientist; a Penn State meteorologist by training. It＊s true that all knowledge is relative; science is never ※settled§ and one never quite reaches solid bedrock. There＊s always a new observation, a new discovery, a radical theory, more testing to do. We look at the universe through a pinhole as God gradually reveals himself to us.Regardless of how you pray or how you vote, we can all agree that fewer toxic chemicals in our air and water is a good thing. But today, . More than  result from dirty air every year, worldwide. Air pollution  across the USA. And statistically, . These numbers betray the ugly truth that the poor pay the steepest price for America＊s toxic reliance on fossil fuels. This is not the world Jesus teaches us to create. ※He will reply, truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me,§ Jesus told his disciples in Matthew 24:45. The Trump administration＊s misguided efforts to roll back protections for public health and the environment puts every one of us at risk, especially those with the fewest resources. Increasingly, America the Beautiful is under siege, as the interests of polluting industries take priority over the safety and welfare of our children. Science is not a substitute for faith; the two are not mutually exclusive. Science has no answer for the miracle of consciousness, the power of love and the promise of eternal life to come. We are here to worship our Creator and enjoy the fruits of his Creation. We are caretakers of a precious gift. We don＊t own anything〞everything around us is on loan. ※My home is in Heaven. I＊m just traveling through this world,§ Billy Graham preached.Science doesn＊t have all the answers, but we would be well advised to listen to  who tell us Earth is warming, and the rapid burning of fossil fuels is responsible. Because the symptoms of a warming planet are becoming harder to deny and dismiss.I just co-authored with Mitch Hescox, a former coal industry employee and a Methodist Minister. He is now leading the Evangelical Environmental Network, made up of conservatives focused on conserving the very thing that sustains us: a healthy, vibrant planet. I＊m proud of the many Christians who will march on April 29 in . Around the world people of faith will speak with one voice about the dangers of climate change, and the opportunities for good, renewable, clean-energy energy jobs. Environmental justice and economic justice go hand in hand. 〞the solar industry already employs twice as many people as coal.

"t sounds like a distant dystopian crisis: a world where global food and water supply chains buckle under the strain of overpopulation and climate change, before being contaminated by weapons of mass destruction unleashed in a desperate fight for access to what little is left.While the crisis may not be  or  as it seems, scientists are already coming up with potential solutions. One is the curiously named metal organic frameworks (MOFs), a powder of nano-engineered crystals with an apparently endless variety of uses.One teaspoon of these crystals contain the surface area of an entire football field, and scientists have been able to customise them to absorb and store vast quantities of a desired substance. In 1998 Prof Omar Yaghi, a chemist who now works at the University of California, Berkeley, made a key breakthrough that built on earlier work by Prof Richard Robson and Bernard Hoskins who showed it was possible to craft structures that can be imagined as metal scaffolding at a molecular level, bound together by organic links.Less than two decades later, MOFs are being applied to purposes that even he could not have imagined, many of which would be particularly handy in a world falling apart 每 such as , , and .Yaghi himself has developed a MOF that enables the harvesting of moisture out of the sky, and unlike other technologies that can already do this in high-humidity areas, the device using Yaghi＊s powder works in the dry desertified conditions that are .※We are living in an uncertain time,§ Yaghi observes, ※and fresh water is going to be one of the most precious and sought-after resources to humanity.§In 2014, Yaghi reached out to MIT mechanical engineer professor Evelyn Wang about creating a machine capable of using his MOF technology. Wang and her team developed a transparent box with a top surface painted black to absorb solar heat, which prompts a reaction that delivers enough drinking water for a person＊s daily needs with 1kg of the powder, even in areas of 20% air humidity.※During the night, these MOFs soak up the water from air, and when the sun comes up, the MOFs will release water to be collected due to the warmth of the sun,§ Yaghi says. ※Then these empty MOFs will be ready to absorb water from the air at night again.§Yaghi hopes these devices will enable people to access what he calls ※personalised water§ 每 off-grid and free of any impurities.MOFs can be applied to just about any purpose. The obstacle has long been producing enough of them at a cheap enough cost to be of any practical use. Some cost upwards of $10,000 per kilo to produce at a painstakingly slow pace. Over in Australia, at the CSIRO, Professor Matt Hill is leading the charge to find a way to make what he calls his ※magic powder§ commercially viable.When he and his team first started pitching MOFs to companies in 2008, Hill says there was plenty of interest: ※People asked ＆could you just send us a bit to try out 每 maybe 50kg?＊. The trouble was, we could only produce a teaspoon a week.§Today CSIRO＊s startup  can produce 10kg per hour on their pilot reactor (named Mindi, after a giant serpent of Indigenous Australian mythology that was said to spit out white powder) using a continuous process 20 times more efficient than the conventional batch process.In September 2016, the first ever commercialisation of a MOF was announced by another Australian 每 Paschal McCloskey, the CEO of UK-based MOF Technologies, a spin-out company from Queen＊s University Belfast.The MOF in question can capture and store a gas that inhibits the hormone that prompts fruit and vegetables to rot, allowing for the safe storage of such foods for up to 12 months. This would enable further efficiencies for a food production process .McCloskey says it is already in use in the US where fruit and vegetable storage provider Decco Worldwide has achieved FDA approval to roll it out, and is undergoing approval processes in countries across Europe and Africa. The company has 15 different MOFs they are seeking to commercialise, including two that MOF Technologies hopes to sell to carbon-intensive industries as a way to capture and convert carbon emissions.MOF Technologies have expanded their production facility in preparation for capacity of between five and 10 tonnes of MOF production per year from 2018.The obscure and complicated nature of the technology makes it ※tricky to get the foot in the door with big companies§, concedes MOF Technologies commercial director Phil Patterson, but he has found a pitch that resonates: ※I tell them it has the highest surface area of any material known to man 每 that usually gets their attention.§An American Chemical Society study released early this year found that MOFs were approaching the projected costs of $10/kg for natural gas storage 每 the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy target 每 while a Royal Society of Chemistry study identified that further commercialisation of MOFs would require refinement of downstream processing, as methods used at the laboratory scale limited production rates.Back at Berkeley, the father of these super-absorbent structures believes scientists have ※just scratched the surface§ of the ※essentially limitless§ applications of the technology.Yaghi says it is ※a pleasure to see that chemistry could combine molecular beauty and function in such a brilliant way as demonstrated by MOFs§.※Imagine, any slight change of the metal ions, the organic components, the shape and topology, or the combination of them could give you a completely different MOF to be used for different purposes. I am not surprised at all to see MOFs being applied to so many different purposes, and I believe more amazing things are going to come.※We have shown the world how it works; the rest is just fine tuning.§ "																																																			
"The government has made a last-minute application to the high court to delay the publication of its plan to tackle the air pollution crisis.Ministers were under a court direction to produce tougher draft measures to tackle illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution, which is largely caused by diesel traffic, by 4pm on Monday. The government＊s original plans had been dismissed by judges .But following the announcement by Theresa May of a , ministers lodged a lengthy application to the court late on Friday. It is understood they are asking judges to allow them to breach Monday＊s deadline and submit a draft in June 每 after the election.It is understood that a full policy will not be produced until September this year.The government has had months to come up with its air quality plans and Whitehall sources indicated to the Guardian this week they would be published in time. The late application to delay publication was condemned by the environmental lawyers group , which successfully took the government to court over its air quality plans. MPs have said air pollution in the UK is a  that causes 40,000 premature deaths a year.James Thornton, the chief executive of ClientEarth, said: ※We are urgently considering the government＊s application to delay the publication of the draft air quality plan which was received on Friday evening, less than one working day before the plans are due. ※It is far from acceptable that ministers have left this to the very last minute. The government proposes to delay the publication of the air quality plan despite the clear public health risk caused by illegal air quality. These plans are essential to safeguard public health and they should be put in place without delay.§The application is likely to be considered by judges on Monday. Judges have already told ministers that their plans were taking too long and imposed the deadline to force the government to come up with new measures more quickly.The government lodged a lengthy application shortly before 7pm on Friday, which was too late for the court to accept. It will now be considered early next week. Thornton said the general election was not an acceptable reason to delay taking action against air pollution. ※This is not a political issue but a public health issue. Whichever party is in power, the British public need to see an air quality plan which relies on good scientific evidence and which ensures that people no longer have to breathe toxic air and suffer the grave consequences to their health as a result,§ he said.Anna Jones, from Greenpeace UK also condemned the delaying tactics. She said: ※Ministers have had months to come up with a robust plan to tackle illegal air pollution. They have no excuses to delay its publication any further.※The Cabinet Office guidance makes it clear that essential consultations can still be launched during purdah, and even mentions safeguarding public health as a ground for exceptions.※Air pollution is a full-blown public health emergency, linked to thousands of premature deaths and a host of health problems. If the government intends to use the election as a pretext to buy more time, that would only be a sign that they just don＊t get the gravity of the situation.§A joint  that hundreds of thousands of children were being educated within 150 metres of a road where levels of nitrogen dioxide from diesel traffic breached legal limits.

We are seeking an extension to comply with pre-election propriety rules.§"																																																			
"The federal government is weighing up how to eliminate toxic chemicals from firefighting foam linked to high-profile contamination scares, including a spill from a Qantas airport hangar into  waterways last week.It comes after a call by the  government for the commonwealth to follow its own ban on the chemicals PFOS and PFOA, which doesn＊t apply to Qantas because it operates on federal land.The state government released test results showing water in Boggy creek, the immediate site of , was now safe for ※recreational use§.The state environment minister, Steven Miles, said the results, which compared samples taken a day and a week after a spill that was linked to the deaths of about 20 fish nearby, were ※encouraging§.But test results for further waterways at the airport and Nudgee beach are pending and health authorities continue to urge people not to eat prawns or fish taken from the Brisbane river after the contamination.Prawn farmers are  from Qantas for business losses.Commercial fishers have said hundreds of kilograms of fish were caught in the area after the spill but it took five days for the peak body to be warned not to sell the product. The state environment department on Friday gave  an investigation notice ordering it to commission a report on ※the source, cause and extent of any environmental harm§.This included ※strict instructions from the state regulator§ to monitor sediment and marine life, Miles said.Miles, who has come under fire for his department taking three days to issue a public warning after it found out about the spill, urged the commonwealth to ※take action to hold the polluter accountable for the contamination§.This included using ※their powers to determine the nature and extent of environmental contamination, and clean it up§, he said.Miles wrote to the federal infrastructure minister, Darren Chester, on Wednesday asking the commonwealth to fast-track its removal of the foam from the airport and other federally owned sites in Queensland.Chester issued a statement on Friday saying the government was considering the ※transitional removal§ of PFOS and PFOA.※The government is considering management options for PFOS and PFOA transitional removal from use, improved management and appropriate disposal of PFOS-containing firefighting foams at all facilities in Australia, consistent with the listing of the chemical under the Stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants,§ he said.Queensland＊s acting chief health officer, Mark Elcock, said it was believed health risks were ※low due to dilution, however until we have the full extent of results our health advice remains unchanged§. ※People still need to take a cautious approach,§ he said.A Qantas spokesman said the airline takes this issue very seriously§ and was already investigating tounderstand what occurred and how to prevent it from happening again§. ※We＊re also continuing to work with authorities to properly assess the impact of the spill.§ There is  that PFOS and PFOA are harmful to human health but the  and there is not enough evidence to fully understand their impact.The alleged contamination of land near air force facilities that used foam containing PFOS and PFOA at Williamtown in New South Wales and Oakey in Queensland is the subject of ."																																																			
"t the end of June some exotic migrants flew into the country . Following a hazardous journey from southern Europe .But while their presence is an inspiring example of the benefits of free movement, their choice of a quarry owned by Mexican minerals multinational  raises some difficult questions about the relationship conservation has with big business.Bee-eaters are one of our most beautiful birds and over the coming months thousands of birders are expected to flock to see them. Rare visitors to the UK, they are usually found nesting in sand banks along the Mediterranean and North Africa. If 每 as seems likely 每 they do colonise this country, it will be the most stark evidence yet of the northerly migration of bird populations due to climate change. Like other migrants, people have been quick to exploit the bee-eaters. The RSPB have set up special viewing facilities with Cemex charging ?5 for people to see them, half of which goes to the landowner. This has already led to accusations of them . When it comes to doing financial deals, both organisations are keen to develop their relationships with Cemex, who have assets in excess of ?26bn. , employing a dedicated adviser, while Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust has been working with the company for 25 years. Yet globally Cemex . The practice of sand mining by other companies now directly threatens important wildlife habitats in Northern Ireland and Dover, endangering birds, seals and other marine life.Andy Spencer, director of sustainability at Cemex, said: ※The arrival of the rare and exotic bee-eaters at East Leake quarry has created a lot of interest amongst not only bird watchers but nature lovers everywhere. The quarry offers the birds the perfect home, in a dedicated sand pile, well away from the operational part of the quarry. We are working in partnership with the RSPB to ensure the safety of the birds and any visitors.§Immigration, whether human or avian, is rarely without controversy. After Brexit, politicians are seeking new global partners to boost Britain＊s finances. Following their bee-eater boon, the RSPB and Nottinghamshire  Trust would do well to do the same."																																																			
"oor air quality, with diesel the biggest culprit, is now thought to be the cause of  in the UK each year.But while cars and lorries have attracted most attention, less reported is the contribution of other polluters to the problem, particularly construction sites. According to the most detailed air-quality study in the UK, , construction sites are responsible for approximately 7.5% of damaging nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, 8% of large particle emissions (PM10) and 14.5% of emissions of the most dangerous fine particles (PM2.5).While a small amount of this (about 1%) is dust from site activities like demolition, the vast majority comes from the thousands of diesel diggers, generators and other machines operating on sites.Yet this machinery is not held to the same emissions standards as on-road vehicles. What＊s more, its proportionate impact will only get higher as on-road emissions drop, according to Daniel Marsh, King＊s College London academic and project manager for the  Low Emission Construction Partnership.So what are the chances the industry can improve?Given the construction industry＊s questionable history with asbestos, which wasn＊t regulated until 1983 or completely banned until 1999 每 almost 40 years after the cancer link was proven 每 some are sceptical. In 2005, the Health and Safety Executive  (pdf) that each year more than 230 construction workers die from cancers caused by exposure to diesel fumes, a figure it hasn＊t since updated, even though more is now known about diesel＊s noxious effects. Marsh is particularly concerned about the impact on those working with the most polluting machines. He says: ※Now on a construction site if you find asbestos it＊s like a scene from ET, people swoop down in protective suits 每 it has become a huge priority. What the industry has failed to take on board is that diesel emissions should be considered in the same way.§Despite this general failure to act, there are innovative firms in the industry trying to help clean up. The Greater London Authority is also attempting to clamp down on the problem. In January, Mayor Sadiq Khan  he intends to bring in a fine like the congestion charge to be paid by firms using polluting machines, beefing up groundbreaking emissions rules on central London building sites introduced under his predecessor Boris Johnson.Leading the charge are firms like Off Grid Energy, which has developed products that turn traditional diesel generators (responsible for an estimated 25% of site emissions) into hybrid machines, reducing fuel consumption by around 60%.Founder and CEO Danny Jones says the requirement for occasional very high ※peak loads§ of energy leads builders to use far bigger generators than necessary, which then remain on all day and night. In contrast, Off Grid＊s battery system stores excess power, turns off generators when charged, and allows much smaller generators to be used. Just one proposed motorway works installation, Jones says, will be the equivalent of taking 225 cars off the road.Another firm tackling the problem is Taylor Construction Plant, which is providing the first UK lighting rigs (mobile units that provide bright lighting, generally for working outside after dark but also for security) to be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. This means zero on-site emissions, at a total cost (including fuel) that product manager Simon Meades says is cheaper than the approximately 20,000 conventional generator-powered lighting rigs operating in the UK. After a slow initial uptake, Meades says demand has grown fivefold in the last year.Even slower to change have been the fleets of diggers and excavators, which until now have relied on powerful diesel engines, but where hybrid technology is finally emerging. Swedish motoring giant Volvo, through its Volvo Construction Equipment subsidiary, has customers currently trialling a prototype hybrid excavator that generates electric power from the down-swing of its boom arm.Patrick Lundblad, the firm＊s senior VP of technology, says these trials have confirmed the vehicle uses around half the fuel of Volvo＊s best-performing conventional excavators. Customer demand doesn＊t seem to be an issue either.※Wherever we go our customers want to have a couple of our green machines,§ he says. However, producing it is not straightforward; 98% of the vehicle parts are new, and supply chains are immature, meaning the firm doesn＊t know when it＊ll be ready for sale. This is not the only problem. Off Grid＊s Jones says resistance to its products from the generator hire industry, which also makes money from selling diesel, came close to driving his firm out of business. ※We＊re a classic disruptive technology, and our challenge is the reluctance of the diesel generator rental industry to engage in a technology that changes what they do now.§ "																																																			
"hree-quarters of the way up Norway＊s west coast, the islands of the  rear out of the Atlantic, towering mightily from the deep sea. They are the spectacular setting for , in which Morten Str?ksnes, a journalist, and his friend Hugo Aasjord, an artist, set out to catch a Greenland shark.This singular fish . It grows to more than 20 feet long, passing hundreds of years at enormous depths preying on sleeping seals. (That  is one of ＊s surprises.) It is inedible: a toxin in the meat induces a fatal inebriation, hence the book＊s title. The , attracting finger-long parasitic worms that hang from its eyeballs, rendering it blind.Why anyone should want to haul this monster to the surface eludes the reader, as it does Str?ksnes and Aasjord. Both are fascinated by the mysteries of the sea, which the shark embodies. Aasjord comes from a fishing family, but he has never seen one. This is as close as the book comes to a motive. The friends catch cod and attract a couple of shark bites, but it is not spoiling anything to reveal that they land no monster.Mostly, they sit in a boat, talking little, leaving Str?ksnes to ruminate whimsically on sharks, sea life, evolution, the culture and history of Norwegian fishing communities and the work of Olaus Magnus, the 16th-century bishop who wrote  and produced a map illustrated with sea monsters.If the book＊s associative structure occasionally feels like a saunter through pages of Wikipedia, there is a trove of interest here, too. We learn that the  has luminescent organs on its arms and hunts in packs, all flashing beacons. (Its victims must think they are being attacked by Christmas ornaments, Str?ksnes comments.)We also learn there is a he ocean looks blue because  in water. Hunting the blue whale led to scenes of utter horror: live foetuses were cut from their mothers＊ wombs and incinerated. Scientists have discovered a fin whale that sings at 52Hz, while all the rest of its species are on 20. They call it the .Isolation was a problem for Norwegian lighthouse keepers; the Norwegian Lighthouse Association had a mobile book collection it circulated among them to stop them going mad. Lighthouse keepers, like all Norwegians, owe their climate to the Gulf stream, which daily carries as much heat to Europe as is generated by a decade of the world＊s coal consumption.Str?ksnes＊s sidelong approach to science is beguiling. He describes water molecules connected by hydrogen bonds as dancers changing partners billions of times a second. Think of them as letters, he says: ※The sea contains all the books ever written in known and unknown languages. In the oceans, other languages and alphabets also arose, such as RNA and DNA, molecules in which genes connect and disconnect in the waves that wash through the helical structures and determine whether the result will be a flower, fish, starfish, firefly or human being.§Fanciful as this is, it does lead him to a lovely next line: ※A gentle wind blows in from the rich library of the sea.§There are moments of adventure, when Str?ksnes goes diving and is seized by a current, and when the friends catch too many cod on a winter day and are nearly swamped, but the triumph of this book is its descriptions. Of the Lofoten peaks, the  wrote: ※The purest of the pure, the coldest of the cold, the grandest imaginable, altars to the God of solitude＃ how difficult to paint this! To convey the elevation, the grandeur and nature＊s inexorable, merciless calm and indifference.§Through observation, Str?ksnes meets the challenge. A Lofoten word, , describes perfect calm. Str?ksnes notes the water ※licking at the underside of its own surface, which gleams above the hollows and high shoals. The sea is a cohesive sheet of light, so bright that it seems to illuminate itself.§ Humans are never so well portrayed, though Str?ksnes is good on the atmospheric currents of male friendship. He deals with a conflict with Aasjord by adopting a silence ※like a deaf shellfish§.Its beauty, undemanding science and soothing, musing qualities have made the book a bestseller in Norway and beyond. In vexed times, gently informative escapism is a winner for publishers and a refuge for readers. Str?ksnes nails the appeal in a single paragraph. ※The landscape is not in front of me. It＊s all around me. There is a strong sense of here in the physical ocean current near the .

"very weekday, millions of primary school children across the UK put their lives at risk. Break time brings relief for busy teachers and is often met with screams of delight as children run out onto the playground.

The  has shown that the motor industry cannot be trusted and the royal colleges＊ report finds that babies and children are particularly at risk. Foetuses in pregnant women exposed to air pollution are more likely to suffer effects to their lungs, heart and neurological development. Children in , areas where the air quality problem is most serious, have a 10% reduced lung capacity and have more respiratory problems, together with effects on their nervous, immune and cardiovascular systems. This leads to physical and mental health problems in later life.The government has compelling evidence to act now. Instead it fears the backlash of diesel drivers who bought their cars in good faith and are still encouraged to do so by lower vehicle tax rates. The public-health risks of diesel particulates have been well known since the days of Margaret Thatcher. However, the impact of nitrogen oxides and the scale of underestimated pollution from lab tests compounded by the sheer volume of cars has now become a public-health catastrophe. That＊s why the demand for a  grows. Meanwhile, the supreme court has demanded that the government produces a clean air strategy, to fulfil our EU air quality obligations. Today, I publish my  to give shape and ambition to the government＊s plan.Britain needs to take bold leadership. We already know that four capital cities 每 Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City 每  and that the markets are investing in zero-emissions futures. Tesla, founded in 2003, produces just  每 $3bn more than Ford, founded a century earlier, which produces 6.6m vehicles.The clean air bill is a route map to reach World  Organization air quality standards by tackling emissions in our cities, ports and airports. It provides the signals and incentives for consumers and producers to change their behaviour to do so.Rather than penalising diesel car-owners who bought in good faith, the bill calls for recall and refit of cars, fiscal incentives and scrappage schemes largely funded by manufacturers for drivers to switch to vehicles that produce fewer 每 or ideally, zero 每 emissions. It provides for a national electric and hydrogen refuelling network and gives local authorities a responsibility to measure and publicise pollution levels, in particular close to vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly. Councils will have powers to restrict access or introduce pollution charges if communities so wish, based on local evidence.What＊s more, new powers are proposed to combat diesel pollution belching into communities from idling ships in port by requiring a switch to port-provided electric power. The bill also addresses freight transport, pollution at airports and ※cheat devices§ installed on cars. Overall, the bill aims to make our right to clean air a reality.Our first duty as parents is to protect our children. Break time, walking to the shops and football in the park shouldn＊t be life-or-death decisions beyond our control. They needn＊t be. For the sake of all our children, let＊s do something about it now."																																																			
"Night herons are among the most mysterious of birds, and for the first time in recorded history they have been spotted breeding in the UK.Long-distance photographs captured an adult pair of black-crowned herons and one of their two offspring at the Westhay Moor national nature reserve, run by Somerset  Trust. The young birds have recently fledged, having been born either on Westhay Moor or the nearby Avalon Marshes.The night heron (is unusual among the heron family in hunting for fish and frogs at night. They roost during the day and can only usually be spotted at dawn and dusk. ※This is incredible news,§ said Stephen Moss, president of Somerset Wildlife Trust. ※To put it in perspective, when I was a young birder in the 1970s, just two species of heron bred in Britain 每 the grey heron and the bittern. But these night herons are now the seventh member of their family to nest in the Avalon Marshes.§ These include both cranes and glossy ibis. ※I am sure climate change has drawn them north, but equally wetland restoration has been a massive success,§ he said. ※We have created an incredible habitat.§Ornithologists will now wait to see if the night heron becomes established in the UK. ※They may hang around, if there is enough food. If not they will probably nip back to France or Spain,§ Moss said.Roger Dickey, chairman of Somerset Ornithological Society, said: ※This is obviously terribly exciting news. Night herons are one of southern England＊s rarer summer visitors and only a dozen or so have been reported in Somerset since 1800. Prime breeding areas do not happen by accident and all organisations and individuals that help to manage this type of habitat are [to be] congratulated.§Purple herons were  in the UK in 2010, on the Dungeness peninsula, Kent, and have since been  Essex.Although global warming appears to be beneficial for herons in the UK, a , such as puffins, fulmars, terns and razorbills, as the fish they rely on are driven north or deeper as waters warm."																																																			
"The fate of the  that broke free from Antarctica＊s Larsen C ice shelf last month has been revealed.Twice the size of Luxembourg, the trillion-tonne iceberg known as A68 was found to have broken off the ice shelf on 12 July after months of speculation about a rift which had been growing for years, with the iceberg ※§ for weeks.At 5,800 sq km it is one of the largest icebergs ever recorded, with its calving leaving the Larsen C ice shelf about 12% smaller in area and at its lowest known extent.※The really interesting thing is that it didn＊t just break through in one clean shot, it formed a lace-network of cracks first and then we were all waiting on tenterhooks to see which one would be the final pathway,§ said Dr Anna Hogg, an expert in satellite observations of glaciers at the University of Leeds and member of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling. Now scientists say the iceberg has spawned further lumps of ice. Based on radar data from the European Space Agency＊s , Hogg says there are now at least 11 smaller icebergs floating near A68 每 fragments thought to have broken off the enormous tablet of ice, or from the Larsen C ice shelf itself, possibly as a result of A68 bumping against the shelf.※I am calling them ＆small bergy bits＊ but the largest ones are bigger than 10km long, which is actually a colossal piece of ice in its own right,§ said Hogg. And the remaining cracks in the ice shelf have not remained static either. ※They have continued to grow and extend a bit still,§ she said. ※Since the iceberg has broken free there has still been some continuing activity on the remaining ice shelf so we are really interested to continue to monitor that.§What＊s more, the iceberg appears to have drifted away from the ice shelf, with a gap of about five kilometres now visible between the two. ※That would suggest that [the iceberg] is floating in the ocean 每 it is not currently grounded,§ said Hogg, adding that there are a number of options for the future of A68: it may break up into smaller pieces, get pushed around by the winds, or be steered by the ocean currents.※We think that this berg is about 200 metres thick of ice, and of course 90% of that is beneath the ocean surface, so it is possible it could become grounded,§ she added.The latest update comes as Hogg and her colleague Hilmar Gudmundsson from the British Antarctic Survey release a commentary in the journal  exploring the implications of the loss of such huge icebergs on the future stability of ice shelves like Larsen C. The new data, says Hogg, shows that the remaining forking cracks in the Larsen C ice shelf are growing in the direction of a feature known as the Bawden Ice Rise 每 an outpost which supports the ice shelf, a little like scaffolding, or the pillar of a building＊s facade. Should the cracks continue in a straight line and the ice shelf break around such a point, she adds, the support would be lost, a result that could greatly reduce the ability of the ice shelf to act as a buttress, and hold back the flow of glaciers into the sea.※If the ice that is resting on those pinning points does break off, that is definitely a concern,§ said Hogg.But experts including Hogg have been quick to point out that calving events like that which occurred in July are part of the and are not necessarily influenced by climate change."																																																			
" has been fined ?8m fine after a massive fuel leak at one its petrol stations polluted a Lancashire river, killing fish and forcing those living nearby to leave their homes.It is the largest fine for a single incident of pollution and is second only to the  in March which related to multiple offences.According to the Environment Agency, 23,500 litres (5170 gallons) of petrol escaped from a tank at the Tesco filling station in Haslingden . The fuel entered the sewerage system with the pungent odour affecting residents living up to 0.6 miles (1km) away, causing people to seek medical attention with headaches and sickness.※This pollution incident had a dramatically negative impact on the local community and the environment with Langwood brook and the river Irwell severely affected,§ said Mark Easedale, an environment manager for the . A week later EA officers investigating the incident found that the fish population immediately downstream was arbout 90% lower than those found upstream, Easedale said.※The sentencing today sends out a clear message to anyone whose recklessness causes serious pollution to the environment 每 we will be relentless in our investigations and take action wherever needed,§ he added.Samples taken from the Irwell detected oil up to three miles downstream with anglers reporting dead fish in Bury, more than 6 miles away.※This was a major leak of fuel in a relatively built-up area and close to a busy superstore,§ said Albert Atkinson, the deputy leader of Lancashire county council. ※The potential consequences are only too obvious.§Tesco, which admitted responsibility for the incident, was fined ?5m for the health and safety offence and ?3m for the environmental offence at Preston crown court. The company was also ordered to pay more than ?57,000 to cover the legal costs of the Environment Agency and Lancashire county council.The investigation found Tesco＊s failure to fix a known issue with the fuel delivery system, coupled with poor emergency procedures, caused the incident.A spokesman for the supermarket chain said: ※We sincerely regret the fuel spillage incident at our petrol station in Haslingden and we＊re sorry for the impact it had on the local environment, our customers and the community. This was a deeply unfortunate isolated incident and one for which we have taken full responsibility. ※Following the incident, we have inspected all relevant petrol stations, introduced a new real-time monitoring system and made a number of further improvements to protect against similar incidents happening again.§"																																																			
"Beaches on remote  islands are heavily polluted with plastic, a new expedition has found, demonstrating that the region is the dumping ground for waste carried northwards on the Gulf Stream.The shorelines of islands in the Svalbard archipelago and of Jan Mayen island were found to be littered with much more plastic waste than on European beaches, despite tiny local populations. The cause is plastic drifting northwards up the Atlantic from Europe and north America, before being stranded in the Arctic. Plastic waste dumped in UK seas is , according to a previous study. At least  over past decades, according to other research. This makes it a major global sink for plastic pollution, many times more concentrated than the well-known . With global warming causing rapid melting of the ice cap, plastic is being released and making the problem even worse. Plastic pollution kills animals that become tangled up and seriously harms those that mistake it for food.The  from the Wageningen Economic Research (WER) institute to six beaches in Svalbard, where they recorded 876 pieces of visible litter per 100m stretch of beach. On Jan Mayen Island, the most remote in the North Atlantic, they recorded 575 pieces. By comparison, an average of 375 pieces were found on Dutch beaches, despite their proximity to the source of the waste.※When these items arrive in the Arctic, they will remain here,§ said Wouter Jan Strietman, one of the WER team. ※This is why the amount of litter in the Arctic is building up every year. As a consequence, the sea around Svalbard ends up becoming the drain hole of the Gulf Stream.§The goal of the expedition, which has just returned from three weeks in the Arctic, is to try to identify the plastic waste. ※Almost nothing is known about the source of the litter,§ said Strietman. ※If you really want to do something about it, then you need to know the sources.§About half the plastic was too broken up to be identified, but 12% was nets, ropes and buoys from fishing vessels. The researchers also found large bundles of tangled strapping band, which is used to secure fish boxes on fishing vessels, with waste strapping most likely thrown overboard. Strietman is now working on projects with the fishing industry to reduce these problems. But much of the waste comes from far away 每 8% of the items were plastic bottle caps 每 and one distinctive bucket-like item was identified as being from oyster farms in southern Europe. The problem is increasing too, said Strietman: ※As you have the currents pouring in new amounts of plastic all day, and those pieces getting smaller, you get a multiplier effect.§※When it really hit home was when I saw in front of the walruses, there was all kinds of plastic,§ Strietman told the Guardian. ※It was right there in front of me. Now you could see the direct relationship between these innocent animals and the plastic.§It was revealed in May that 38m pieces of litter had polluted the uninhabited Henderson Island in the South Pacific. With 99.8% of the litter being plastic, it represents the highest density of human-related debris recorded anywhere in the world. In February,  levels of toxic pollution in the Mariana trench, with plastic waste carrying industrial chemicals to one of the most remote and inaccessible places on the planet."																																																			
"Taking a side street route when walking through a city cuts a person＊s air pollution exposure by half, according to a new study.Signposting these clean air routes and providing online maps would keep people away from heavily polluted main streets and would benefit their health, the researchers said. In fact the UK group behind the research have developed a new  that allows people to put in any route and be shown a low-pollution walking option. Air pollution is the ※§, according to the World Health Organisation, with 80% of the world＊s  that exceed WHO standards for pollution.The new research was conducted in London, which has illegally high levels of toxic air. The team from King＊s College  analysed seven popular routes through the city, with different researchers simultaneously walking along main road and backstreet routes while carrying pollution measuring equipment.The routes included King＊s Cross Station to Euston Station, Embankment to Covent Garden, and Earl＊s Court to Holland Park; each pair of routes were similar in length. Black carbon was measured as it comes primarily from diesel vehicles, which are the main source of the city＊s pollution problem.The average reduction in overall pollution exposure for those taking the side street routes was 53%, with the cuts ranging from 30-60%. Gary Fuller, at King＊s College London, said: ※This could be better in so many ways for people＊s pollution exposure and probably for their sense of wellbeing as well. Anything you can do to limit your exposure will be good for your health.※The same applies anywhere, so it would be great if these ideas were taken up in other cities,§ he said. ※We weren＊t surprised at the results, but it was very nice to be able to demonstrate what we believed we would find.§The research, released ahead of the UK＊s  on Thursday, was commissioned by Cross River Partnership (CRP), a public-private city regeneration group with funding from the Mayor of London. ※There is a lot of work going on to improve air quality in London but we are not going to get to the point any time soon in the next couple of years where we are meeting the WHO targets,§ said Brendon Harper, CRP＊s air quality project manager. So it is very important we encourage people to change the way they walk and cycle [to work] so they can reduce their exposure.§Harper said the first clean air walking route to be signposted in London was the Kings Cross-Euston route, which has already seen a tripling in footfall and a boost to local businesses.The air pollution problem in the UK has been called a  by a cross-party committee of MPs. Levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), emitted mostly by diesel vehicles, have been above legal limits in almost 90% of urban areas in the UK since 2010. These and other toxic fumes are estimated to cause 40,000 early deaths a year but the government has failed to take effective action. The environmental law firm ClientEarth has already defeated the ministers twice in the courts over the adequacy of air quality plans. Ministers＊  but were , and ClientEarth is now . The new environment secretary, Michael Gove, has yet to make any statement on air pollution.Oliver Hayes, Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, said: ※Our analysis of the  shows the scale of this public health crisis. It is not acceptable that air pollution is predicted to go on damaging people＊s lungs for years to come. People in Birmingham and Leeds would be breathing toxic air for nearly another decade, unless more is done without any more delay. ※The current plans for cleaning up our air are just not enough,§ he said. ※With 40,000 early deaths each year from air pollution, and children＊s young lungs especially vulnerable, this is a sickening amount of suffering that is preventable.§"																																																			
"he piercing calls coming from above, high up on the chalk cliff, reveal that there are still  at home. Four chicks have fledged, and over the course of a few short weeks I＊ve been watching them grow from ungainly youngsters, flapping in short, clumsy flights across the cliff face, to become stronger aerobats like their parents. The mother soars overhead, her tail fanned out, and slowly banks and turns back towards the cliff, calling again, the sun catching her grey and white face. The young birds 每 brown with heavily streaked breasts 每 answer, their voices sounding more like squeaks than the piercing shrieks of the adult.In the past week, both parents have been enticing the chicks to follow them by carrying prey in their talons, which they give to the young mid-air. When they all leave the nest site, probably some time in the next few weeks, the adults will teach them how to hunt live prey 每 birds in flight 每 over the Downs.In the evening, I drive into Chichester, and wander the streets as the shops are closing.

"he footpath to , through hay meadows long since cut, follows the south bank of the Wear. Today the water was shallow and clear. But after heavy rain in the upper dale the river becomes a torrent and it has eroded small terraces so stony and steep they are never cut at hay time. These places are refuges for a late-summer flora of , harebells as blue as the sky overhead.It＊s a place to sit among the flowers on an afternoon when summer seems to be slipping past too quickly.I watched a tiny , one of a number of species that are hard to tell apart, struggling to land on the harebell blooms as they bent and recoiled on their slender stems in the blustery wind. The bee finally gripped a dangling bell, crawled under the lip and disappeared inside.When I tilted the flower upwards I could see the pollinator, busy collecting nectar at the base of the bell. This was an old flower with withered stamens, so the bee seemed to be freeloading. To figure out how the harebell exploits its visitors 每 mostly small flies and solitary bees 每 in return for a sugary reward, I split open a younger flower. The bud revealed a long central , like the clapper of a bell, tipped with a tightly closed female stigma. The male stamens, arranged around it, had already burst and coated the hairy central style with a layer of white pollen. Any small bee struggling through the narrow entrance of a newly opened bell, as it swayed in the wind, could hardly avoid collecting pollen.Back inside the old flower, the furrow bee was beginning to scale that central column and clamber out over the stigma, which, in mature flowers like this, splits into three lobes that curve backwards, like a grappling hook, partially blocking the exit. Any bee carrying pollen would surely have smeared it on that receptive surface on its way in or out.The architecture of the harebell flowers choreographs the visitors＊ movements, making pollination likely, but the capricious wind that made the bells dance and the insects struggle to go in and out played its part too."																																																			
"Three rangers have been killed and another is missing after an attack by violent militia in Virunga national park in the , bringing the number of fatalities in the park this year to eight.The park rangers, Charles Paluku Syaira, Jonas Paluku Malyani and Pacifique Musubao Fikirini were murdered on the morning of Monday 14 August during a routine patrol around the park, which is home to critically endangered mountain gorilla.  the attack was carried out by Mai Mai rebels, the notoriously violent militia that have been operating throughout DRC since the 1996 war. The militias are formed by local leaders, and are renowned recruiters of child soldiers.Mai Mai rebels are accused of being behind multiple deadly attacks against park rangers across the country. In December 2016, , a ranger at Virunga park, was shot, and on 16 July this year,  was killed. Of the most recent attack, Virunga national park said in a statement: ※Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with the families and widows of the rangers.※Ranger Charles leaves behind his wife and eight children; ranger Jonas leaves behind his wife and five children, and ranger Pacifique leaves behind a wife and four children.§They added that tourism activities in Virunga ※remain unaffected§.The incident brings the total number of rangers killed in the field in 2017 to eight, according to . More than 160 rangers have died protecting the park in the last 20 years. ※The political and security crisis DRC is experiencing has hit park rangers particularly hard as they are protecting an area that armed groups are using to regroup, hide and resupply,§ said Melanie Gouby, a journalist whose investigation into a British oil company＊s illegal activities in Virunga national park was part of the Oscar-nominated documentary Virunga. ※Their work is more dangerous than ever.§Virunga national park is a Unesco world heritage site, the .

"The  will push for a Senate inquiry into illegal waste dumping following damaging revelations on the ABC＊s Four Corners program last week.Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson says federal parliament must scrutinise the issues raised in the program, which exposed  allegedly sending waste by road and rail to Queensland to avoid paying New South Wales millions of dollars in tariffs. He has also called on the Turnbull government to release a  to show how it intends to combat  from plastic in Australia＊s oceans.He said the federal government should ban plastic bags in Australia if state governments did not do it soon.※We want to see the federal government taking action on federal product stewardship schemes on the waste that we know makes its way into our oceans, breaks up into millions of little pieces, and kills marines life,§ Whish-Wilson said. ※We now know we＊re eating toxic plastic when we consume seafood in this country.※This should be a political no-brainer. Any politician out there, when they go and speak to their electorate, will hear that they want us to act.§Whish-Wilson said the Greens would push on Thursday for a Senate inquiry into the allegations raised in last week＊s Four Corners program.The program alleged there was corruption within the NSW waste industry, and that the Environmental Protection Agency knew of the illegal waste dumping but failed to prevent it.Steve Beaman, the EPA＊s director of waste management, has reportedly taken four weeks＊ leave after  Whish-Wilson said a Senate inquiry must look into the matter.※We＊re going to have to step in and actually scrutinise what＊s going on in the recycling industry in this country,§ he said on Wednesday. ※It＊s very important that the federal government makes a statement on this issue. ※So far there＊s been silence from the environment minister. He knows that he should have a federal, fully-integrated management plan that outlines product stewardship schemes for various categories and wastes that we＊ve seen raised in Four Corners.§Whish-Wilson also called on the Turnbull government to release its threat abatement plan for marine plastics.A spokesman for environment minister Josh Frydenberg told Guardian Australia the Threatened Species Committee would consider a revised draft of the plan at its meeting in November, before it gets presented to the minister.The film  was played in Parliament House on Tuesday evening, focusing on the devastating impact plastic is having on marine ecosystems. .It is estimated that  makes its way into the ocean each year. This figure is only likely to rise, and  that by 2050 the amount of plastic in the sea would outweigh the amount of fish. and the number will jump another 20% by 2021, creating an environmental crisis some campaigners predict will be as serious as climate change.Jayne Paramor, the deputy director of  每 which represents 47 national, state and local groups 每 said marine pollution posed an ※enormous§ problem for Australia.※This is one of the most significant problems we face on multiple levels across the country,§ she said.※Australia relies hugely on our oceans from a recreational and economic point of view, and the health impacts that we are beginning to understand, as a result of this problem, are significant§. Liza Dicks, Sea Shepherd Australia＊s national coordinator, said Sea Shepherd had been running a marine debris campaign for the past 18 months and had collected 800,000 pieces of debris from 200 beaches, 68% of which was plastic.※We believe there is no time to waste, our oceans are our life support system,§ she said."																																																			
"Fish may be actively seeking out plastic debris in the oceans as the tiny pieces appear to smell similar to their natural prey, new research suggests.The fish confuse plastic for an edible substance because microplastics in the oceans pick up a covering of biological material, such as algae, that mimics the smell of food, according to the  published on Wednesday .Scientists presented schools of wild-caught anchovies with plastic debris taken from the oceans, and with clean pieces of plastic that had never been in the ocean. The anchovies responded to the odours of the ocean debris in the same way as they do to the odours of the food they seek.The scientists said this was the first behavioural evidence that the chemical signature of plastic debris was attractive to a marine organism, and reinforces other work suggesting the odour could be significant.The finding demonstrates an additional danger of plastic in the oceans, as it suggests that fish are not just ingesting the tiny pieces by accident, but actively seeking them out.Matthew Savoca, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and lead author of the study, told the Guardian: ※When plastic floats at sea its surface gets colonised by algae within days or weeks, a process known as biofouling. Previous research has shown that this algae produces and emits DMS, an algal based compound that certain marine animals use to find food. [The research shows] plastic may be more deceptive to fish than previously thought. If plastic both looks and smells like food, it is more difficult for animals like fish to distinguish it as not food.§Plastic debris in the oceans, ranging from the microscopic to large visible pieces, is recognised as a growing problem as it does not readily degrade and hundreds of thousands of tonnes are dumped in the sea annually. Larger pieces have been found in the intestines of whales and seabirds, where they are thought to be potentially fatal, while the smallest pieces have been detected in the guts of even juvenile fish and molluscs.

"Adani＊s proposed  in Queensland would be the largest Australia has ever seen and the federal and state governments are keen to offer it financial support.Adani has said that over a 60-year lifetime, the company expects to extract 2.3bn tonnes of coal, which would make it equivalent to the biggest mine in the US.It is proposed to have six open-cut pits as well as five underground mines, with a disturbance area more than 30km long.The company initially obtained approval to remove 60m tonnes of coal each year, but has scaled back its ambition to an initial production rate of 25m tonnes a year.But building the mine would have a much wider indirect effect. Carmichael would be the first mine in the giant untapped Galilee coal basin. The infrastructure that would be built to allow extraction of coal from the Carmichael mine could serve at least 10 more. If all the mines mooted for the basin were built and reached their proposed maximum output at the same time, they would be producing 330m tonnes of coal a year 每 more than Australia＊s entire coal industry does now.Industry consultant Wood Mackenzie  that about half that might actually be extracted in any one year.The government＊s Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund is considering an A$900m subsidised loan and Matt Canavan, who was responsible for that fund until  last month, has .The Queensland state government has made a deal with Adani, offering it a break on its royalty payments for the coal it extracts 每 but the . A wide range of groups are opposed to the project for different reasons.If the mine does extract all the coal Adani says it plans to, the average emissions from burning that coal .And if the mine reaches its touted peak production rate of 60m tonnes a year, it will be responsible for more than 120m tonnes of CO2 emissions in those years 每 more than the annual emissions of many countries.If the mine goes ahead and that leads to the development of other mines in the basin, their potential combined maximum output  being emitted each year. That＊s about 1.3 times Australia＊s total current emissions. If even half that were produced it would result in emissions larger than those of most nations.If the world wants to have a 50% chance of keeping global warming at less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, . In the Asia-Pacific region, more than 90% of coal needs to stay in the ground, according to research published in Nature.Coal burned in other countries is not counted in Australia＊s emissions 每 coal from Carmichael would be exported to India 每 but many scientists and commentators  that producing those emissions runs counter to Australia＊s commitment in the Paris climate agreement to work to keep global warming at ※well below§ 2C.Among the most pressing environmental concerns with the Carmichael mine, aside from climate change, is its reliance on water, a precious resource in Australia. Coal mining uses a lot of water for everything from cooling cutting equipment in underground mines through to transporting coal as a slurry in pipelines. About 250 litres of freshwater is used for each tonne of coal produced.In April the  government granted Adani a highly unusual water licence to extract unlimited amounts from a water body that feeds into the underground Great Artesian Basin. it will use 12bn litres of water a year 每 or .  this will ※have an impact on the underground water levels in the region of the mine§ both during and after the .As that water level drops, farmers＊ bores could run dry and unique ecological communities in the region that rely on the natural springs may be destroyed. Environmentalists and farmers have complained that there are no ※trigger thresholds§ that will force mining to stop if Carmichael uses too much water.Environmental groups have worked hard to link the development of the Carmichael mine to the destruction of the reef. Over the past two years, half the coral on the reef has been killed in  caused by rising water temperatures, mostly a result of climate change.Scientists have said that for coral reefs to have any chance of a future, global warming must be stopped at 1.5C. Even if that could be achieved, coral reefs would be severely degraded.So to the extent that coal from the mine contributes to global warming, it is a threat to the reef. But the mine will also have a more direct impact, since the coal will be exported to  via a shipping terminal on the Queensland coast at Abbot Point, opposite the reef, increasing the risks of collisions, spills and excessive coal dust harming corals.The terminal will be expanded to accommodate coal from the Carmichael mine, which will involve dredging. This is notoriously problematic for surrounding coral, since it stirs up sediment, which degrades water quality and starves coral of sunlight.A  detailed a long list of allegations of environmental damage caused by Adani Enterprises and its subsidiaries around the world. And  by the same group detailed evidence in support of allegations of illegal business dealings, which EJA says points to involvement in large-scale illegal mineral exports and violations of Indian environmental laws that harmed the environment and communities.The most common reason given by Australian politicians for supporting the Carmichael mine is jobs 每 but other arguments are raised in support of it too.Queensland＊s unemployment rate is at 6.4%, and higher in some regional areas. So 10,000 jobs, as , Australian prime minister  and others have said the project will provide, are a strong motivation to support the project.But that ※10,000 jobs§ figure is pulled from Adani＊s publicity material, and is contradicted by testimony in a Queensland court, given by consultants for Adani. Jerome Fahrer from ACIL Allen Consulting  on behalf of Adani estimating the project would create just 1,464 jobs.And that figure is an estimate over the lifetime of the project, assuming it reaches maximum capacity, extracting 60m tonnes of coal a year.But according to Wood Mackenzie, the jobs in Queensland would come at the expense of mining jobs elsewhere. In a report for the Infrastructure Fund, which has coal investments in the neighbouring state of New South Wales, it found coal-producing basins in NSW and southern Queensland would cut their production by more than a third, due to a drop in coal prices, if Carmichael opened. It also found 10 new projects that would otherwise go ahead in NSW would no longer be profitable.Australian ministers have argued that coal from Adani＊s Carmichael mine , since it will be used to generate electricity in a country where many people have no access to power.Australia＊s minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, has said the mine will , not just in India but right across the world§.It is true that about 75m rural households and 6m urban households in India have no power. But burning more coal won＊t help the vast majority of those people, since they don＊t have a connection to the electricity grid.Access to the grid is too expensive for most of those people, making off-grid renewable generation a much more realistic option for alleviating energy poverty.

"A controversial pesticide can potentially wipe out common bumblebee populations by preventing the formation of new colonies, research has shown.The neonicotinoid chemical thiamethoxam dramatically reduces egg-laying by queen bumblebees, say scientists. Predictions based on a mathematical model suggest this could result . Lead researcher Professor Nigel Raine, from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, said: ※Bumblebee queens that were exposed to the neonicotinoid were 26% less likely to lay eggs to start a colony. ※A reduction this big in the ability of queens to start new colonies significantly increases the chances that wild populations could go extinct.§ In  on flowering crops was imposed throughout the European Union due to claims the nicotine-related chemicals can harm pollinators. Currently . Environmental campaigners want to see a permanent ban extended to all crops, while  and a return to older, more harmful pesticides. One argument against the pro-ban lobby has been that most neonicotinoid research has focused on honeybees and ignored the important contribution to crop pollination made by wild bees, including bumblebees. The new study exposed  bumblebee queens to thiamethoxam in spring, when the insects emerge from hibernation and prepare to lay their first eggs.Roughly half of a population of 300 bees were fed syrup laced with the pesticide at levels similar to those found in wild pollen and nectar. Egg-laying behaviour and death rates were observed for 10 weeks. The research, published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, showed that queens exposed to the pesticide laid 26% fewer eggs than those that were not exposed. A mathematical model was then used to predict what such a rate of decline might mean in the real world. The effect on population dynamics ※dramatically increased§ the chances of local extinction, the scientists found. Prof Raine said: ※When a queen is going to set up a colony, she will secrete wax and form it into containers for nectar and pollen. ※She will then begin to lay her eggs and sit on them like a bird ＃ these spring queens represent the next generation of bumblebee colonies. This study shows that neonicotinoids could be having a devastating effect on wild bumblebee populations. ※We urgently need to know more about how pesticides could be affecting other species to make informed decisions about the risks associated with using these chemicals.§ "																																																			
"ast week, a 25-second, low-quality  sniffing the ground caused a flurry of excitement in the media. My initial reaction to this story 每 as to all such ostensibly low-consequence, fauna-based stories 每 was: WHY IS THERE SO MUCH EXPOSURE BEING GIVEN TO THIS GLORIFIED RAT WHEN THERE IS REAL HUMAN SUFFERING AND INJUSTICE GOING ON IN THIS WORLD? Then, when I＊d calmed down (and switched the letter case of my inner monologue), I determined the mass enthusiasm to be innocent enough, but struggled still to understand what was so important about one fuzzy little pine marten, even if it was the first live one to be spotted in Yorkshire for 35 years.I felt the same during the frenzy surrounding the deaths of , the Cincinatti gorilla shot needlessly by unfeeling man, and Cecil, the Zimbabwean lion shot needlessly by unfeeling man. On both those occasions, too, the outraged hysteria that gripped many of my Twitter followees seemed an over-reaction. Time will tell whether the North York Moors-based critter will join his mammalian confr豕res in the pantheon of wildlife memes; perhaps it will require him to be pointlessly shot first.In fact, many aspects of our relationship with animals seem sadistic. The online cat cult is often premised on the humiliation of the nine-lived creatures, dressed up to look like fools and ventriloquised with ridiculous, ungrammatical captions (such as ※I can has cheezburger§).The idolatry of Cecil and Harambe had a facetious edge. The RSPCA investigates about 140,000 complaints?of animal abuses every year (which, given that the pets probably aren＊t making these complaints themselves, makes you wonder how many go unreported). Mistreatment of pets remains rife, zoos remain profitable and it still remains an acceptable sport to make horses suffer the brutality of having to be around toffs on Grand National day. But the reverence for the pine marten seemed wholesome enough. Let＊s just humour Britain＊s self-identification as a nation that loves animals, even if we often (savagely) mistreat them by, for example, putting them in bins. What does that say about our national character? Might it reveal some collective psycho-social shortcoming?It＊s been said that pet ownership is a coping strategy for loneliness and social and/or romantic failure, amounting to the enslavement?of less intelligent beings as a kind of emotionally servile underclass. Personally, although I enjoyed pets during the innocent and needy years of childhood, as an adult I＊m yet to reach such a state of low morale that acquiring one seems necessary. But I understand those who do keep pets, though less so their collective tendency to incessantly post intimate-bordering-on-erotic selfies with them.There＊s always been a more intellectual, even poetic, strain to the British appreciation of animals and nature, revivified of late by naturalist books such as Robert Macfarlane＊s , Helen Macdonald＊s , Amy Liptrot＊s  每 and a load of others, which I haven＊t read but are called things such as Flow: Why Rivers Are Better Than People, and Otter: Why I Decided to Become an Otter.Inevitably, there＊s been a critical backlash. A reckoning for ※new nature writing§ came with author and naturalist Mark?Cocker＊s charge in the? that it is too ※tame§ and represents merely ※a?literature of consolation§. Macfarlane felt moved to reply, arguing that ※powerful writing can revise our ethical relations with the natural world§.That＊s a noble enough credo. I like this stuff and, guess what, I like nature. But my mind was snagged on Cocker＊s long barb. Could it be that this naturalist renaissance amounts to a mass psychological emigration from the ever more grave realities of the modern world; an almost reactionary, patriotic reappraisal of England＊s bucolic delights? Case in point: last summer I spent the last week of June bemoaning the ill-founded patriotism revealed by the Brexit vote and the first week of July drifting around the Hampshire countryside on a canal boat cooing ※oh England!§ to myself.Of course the popularity of these books doesn＊t indicate anything new about the national attitude; interesting but quite tame naturalist television programmes such as  and  have been popular for years. But despite these shows＊ occasional mention of decreased biodiversity or rising sea temperatures, as a consequence of climate change, as well as the valiant efforts of the likes of David Attenborough and Simon Amstell, our culture has not yet found an effective way of converting our mass appreciation of nature into an impulse to truly change the collective course. One in 10 UK wildlife species faces extinction, green issues hardly featured during the last election and now the Energy Institute believes Britain＊s reformist energy policy is ※on pause§ because of Brexit.Tame or not, Macfarlane sets his writing meaningfully within the context of the Anthropocene, the name given by some ecologists to the current geological epoch, in which human activity is altering the Earth and its ecosystem inexorably. Liptrot and Macdonald show how a personal re-engagement with nature can be a useful remedy for addiction and grief.I will never forget receiving a bad?review for my Edinburgh fringe show in 2013 and taking myself on a stormy day to the top of Arthur＊s Seat, where I let the wet wind repeatedly thwack me about the face and, after half an hour or so, began to see that one bad review wasn＊t such a big deal.So what does all of this mean for the pine marten? Perhaps?it could serve as a motif?in a gritty coming-of-age, state-of-the-nation novel: ※A Pine Marten for a Pauper§, in which a Yorkshire lad, life chances ruined by austerity, finds a baby pine marten on the school field (miraculously, not yet sold for unaffordable housing) and develops with it a heartbreakingly close bond. Until his brother, a walking metaphor for Tory sadism, pointlessly shoots it and renders it a meme.But perhaps most of all, the excitement, albeit tame, engendered by the sighting of the pine marten gives us hope 每 during a week when inordinate heatwaves continued to grip Europe, global gas emissions records were revealed to be useless, and the Trump administration tried to  每 that people still give a shit about nature."																																																			
"f progressives can＊t take back control of the White House and Congress from climate change deniers in the next three years, it＊s conceivable that humankind could be screwed. But evidence is mounting that a new political force is up to the task. It has millions of potential supporters across the US, the UK and Canada. It＊s openly critical of capitalism. And it＊s led by millennials such as Moumita Ahmed.The 25-year-old activist is intimately aware of what＊s at stake. She grew up in Queens, New York, and rose to prominence during the 2016 Democratic primaries as co-founder of a group now known as Millennials for Revolution. She has since rallied thousands of people her age against Donald Trump＊s travel ban and the Republican healthcare bill. Yet climate change is never far from Ahmed＊s mind. Rising oceans directly threaten her family members back in Bangladesh. ※It makes me so angry and upset,§ Ahmed said. ※But at the end of the day, I still believe there is hope.§The window for hope is closing rapidly. Over 60 climate experts  this June that we only have until 2020 to stop the worst damages of global warming. ※While the world can＊t be healed within the next few years, it may be fatally wounded by negligence,§  Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a leading climate researcher.Trump is inflicting wound after wound. His exit from the Paris climate treaty is a blow to the global fight against climate change. Yet it＊s only one of many concessions Trump＊s made to the fossil fuel industry, which spent $36 million on lobbying from January to March alone,  the Center for Public Integrity. ※I have been moving at record pace＃to eliminate the barriers to domestic energy production,§ Trump . Oil and gas companies are delighted. ※Not in our wildest dreams, never did we expect to get everything,§  an industry leader.And Republicans in the House, the majority of whom deny the existence of climate change, are now rushing through legislation that ※could provide bulletproof armor during future challenges to Trump＊s agenda,§  InsideClimateNews.Voters have just two chances to reverse course before the three-year window closes: the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential election. But turning the US into a climate hero isn＊t as simple as rejecting the Republican party. Democratic elites must be convinced that bold climate action is possible. And the party needs ※to gain enough power to pass their shit,§ said Vox columnist David Roberts, an expert on climate politics. In today＊s political environment, ※that second step just seems impossible.§Yet millennials such as Ahmed have no choice but to fight.

Next came the 2016 Democratic primaries. Voters under the age of 30 cast two million votes for ※socialist§ Bernie Sanders while Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump  got 1.6 million. Sanders leveraged this support to get far-left policies in the Democratic platform, including a climate test for oil pipelines and tougher limits on fracking. Anti-fracking activist Josh Fox  a ※monumental victory.§Yet Ahmed believes the most enduring legacy of Sanders＊ campaign was to show that millions of millennials support political leaders who fight the economic status quo. ※For us to deal with [climate change] we have to address capitalism,§ Ahmed argued. Despite Harvard polling  51% of young people oppose our current system, the message fell on deaf ears in the Democratic Party. ※We＊re capitalists, and that＊s just the way it is,§  Rep. Nancy Pelosi this February. Across the Atlantic, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was listening. He borrowed campaign ideas from Sanders in the UK＊s 2017 election, vowing to fix an economy ※rigged for the rich§ and take bold action on issues like global warming. The result was a flood of 18 to 24-year-old voters 每 with turnout  72 percent 每 and huge election gains for Labour. ※Britain＊s younger generation flexed their political muscles to real effect for the first time,§ the Guardian . To Ahmed it proves a powerful global movement of young people is emerging: ※We are the future.§Others aren＊t so sure. Despite all the enthusiasm for Sanders in 2016, actual voter turnout among Millennials in the US election was a dismal 50%. ※Youthful enthusiasm for the outsider is an extremely fickle political horse,§ Roberts argued. To win the Senate in the 2018 midterms, Democrats need to defend 25 seats and pick up an additional three. ※The Senate map is horrifically bad for the party,§ Vox , while gerrymandering tilts the House ※in favor of Republicans.§ Democrats have also  four special elections for Congress since Trump came to power. But far-left politicians are winning local elections across the country. They include Chokwe Lumumba the new 34-year-old mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, who  to build ※the most radical city on the planet§; and a Black Lives Matter advocate as Philadelphia＊s next District Attorney. This trend ※has major implications§ for US progressive politics,  the outlet McClatchy DC. Meanwhile, thousands of young people  activist groups such as Our Revolution, Indivisible and Democratic Socialists of America. ※We＊re still seeing a ton of action and organizing coming out of millennials,§ Ahmed explained. ※It＊s going to have a ripple effect.§If momentum persists, it＊s plausible that millennials who expelled an oil and gas leader in Canada, turned a socialist into a serious challenger for US President and invigorated the UK＊s far-left could block Trump＊s climate agenda as early as 2018. With time quickly ticking down, it would mean a less screwed future for us all."																																																			
"fter 150 years of being treated as a quaint rural pastime, grouse shooting is now  每 unless it reforms it is doomed, and it may drag other country sports down with it.On Saturday, the start of the grouse shooting season, the social media hashtag  was trending, and a social media message, ※I want to see an end to raptor persecution in the uplands. Criminal activity needs to be stopped§, set up by 15-year-old birdwatcher and conservation campaigner , was sent to more than .Thousands marched in London protesting at the badger cull, calling for foxhunting to remain banned and calling for an end to grouse shooting. Recently, Sir Ian Botham was given a rough time on BBC Radio 5 Live when he couldn＊t answer questions about gamebird shooting, and on Friday the RSPB released a video of armed men, who might have been gamekeepers, meddling with a nest of a rare bird of prey on a North Yorkshire moor. What＊s going on?Driven grouse shooting consists of a line of ※beaters§, blowing whistles and waving flags to chase wild red grouse towards a distant line of guns, waiting to shoot at them as they fly past. By 10 December, when the season ends, around 500,000 grouse will be killed. There is big money involved. Eating a roast grouse costs around ?25 in a London restaurant, but shooting that grouse costs ?75, so a day＊s shooting may cost several thousand pounds.Red grouse live in the hills of  and northern England. To increase red grouse numbers, heather is burned and to provide a mixed-age profile of heather plants for the birds to eat, wet areas are drained to encourage heather growth. Natural predators such as foxes, stoats and crows are trapped or shot (in very large numbers) because they eat grouse (and don＊t pay ?75 a bird for the privilege). Grouse are given medication because their unnaturally high densities allow diseases to spread. Mountain hares carry ticks that affect grouse, so are killed. Grouse moors are as intensively managed as East Anglian wheatfields.The growing opposition to grouse shooting stems from three overlapping communities: animal welfare activists, environmental campaigners and nature conservationists. Many, when they realise the scale of the killing, not just of grouse but also predators, are appalled that this Victorian ※sport§ is still allowed. Environmentalists highlight the intensive moorland management and a body of science demonstrating that this causes increased flood risk, higher water-treatment costs, greater carbon emissions, damage to moorland habitats and reduced insect life in the streams running off grouse moors. It＊s a classic case of a niche activity of a few, hitting the pockets of the many through higher home insurance costs, higher water bills and a damaged environment.Nature conservationists＊ poster-bird is the hen harrier, just one protected species illegally killed on grouse moors. There should be over 300 pairs of hen harriers nesting in the English uplands, (2,600 pairs in the UK as a whole) and this year there were just seven pairs ( around 550 pairs in the UK). The police struggle to catch the perpetrators of these wildlife crimes 每 understandably, since they operate covertly on private shooting estates in the least populated parts of the UK.There are many reasons for calling the start of the grouse shooting season ※inglorious§ and the industry is under extreme pressure. But rather than mend its ways, reform its management and throw out its bad apples it has copied the tobacco, pesticides and fossil fuels industries and poured money into vilifying its opponents and a campaign of denial. TV presenter, author and photographer Chris Packham has been  每 the Countryside Alliance called on the BBC to sack Packham for his off-camera campaigning, and less famous campaigners have been threatened and vilified. The grouse industry funded a campaign targeted at the RSPB.Grouse shooting has friends in high places 每 even the Balmoral Estate visitor centre sings its praises 每 and the Conservative government has done nothing to push the case for reform. In Scotland there is more progress and a strong chance that the SNP government will introduce licensing of shooting estates in 2018.On this day last year, an  I organised which called for an outright ban on intensive grouse shooting reached 123,000 signatures when it closed in September (a rival pro-shooting petition raised only 25,000) and secured a Westminster Hall parliamentary debate. The Conservative MPs packing that debate represented a large proportion of the House of Commons＊s old Etonians, and they spent as much time denigrating Chris Packham and me as supporting grouse-shooting.The Green party supports a ban of all bloodsports but Labour, a fundamentally urban party, hasn＊t yet woken up to the fact that a policy of banning grouse-shooting is the right thing to do and is also an electoral asset.Intensive grouse shooting will cease in my lifetime. The industry has been nasty and intransigent and is dragging down the reputation of less disreputable country sports. The pressure on grouse shooting will not go away.The question for the rest of the shooting community is: do they want to be dragged into a mire from which they may never emerge or should they cut the grouse shooters loose and distance themselves as quickly as possible?; now a, blogger, campaigner and author"																																																			
"An ocean-going tanker is to be fitted with a type of ※spinning sail§ invented almost a century ago in a step that could lead to more environmentally friendly tankers worldwide.The unusual sails are rotating columns fixed to the deck of the ship, whose interaction with the wind provides forward thrust. The trial is backed by Maersk, one of the world＊s biggest shipping companies and ＊s shipping arm.International shipping runs largely on highly polluting ※bunker§ fuel and the industry is coming under increasing pressure to play its part in tackling climate change by reducing emissions. Technologies being explored to cut pollution include kites, batteries or using biofuels.The spinning, or rotor sail, was invented by the German engineer Anton Flettner and he put it into , one of which crossed the Atlantic in 1926. It propels the ship because when wind passes the spinning rotor sail, the air flow accelerates on one side and decelerates on the opposite side, creating a thrust force perpendicular to the wind direction.The rotor sails being installed on a 240 metre-long Maersk tanker are modern lightweight versions produced by the Finnish company . They will be 30 metres tall and 5 metres in diameter, the largest rotor sails ever deployed and the first to be used on a tanker.In favourable wind conditions, each rotor sail can produce the equivalent of 3MW of power, much more than the 50kW of electricity needed to turn it, said Norsepower＊s CEO, Tuomas Riski. If the wind direction reverses, the rotation of the sail can be also be reversed. Riski said that overall fuel savings of 7-10% were expected, equivalent to about 1,000 tonnes of fuel a year: ※We are pretty confident we are in this kind of range.§ The company has already  and saw a saving of 6%. Riski said technology improvements and the rise of environmental regulations mean the rotor sail could take off now, having failed to compete with diesel power in the 1920s. ※Wind is the only renewable energy available at large scale in the ocean,§ said Riski. The new sails will be fitted during the first half of 2018, then analysed at sea until the end of 2019.※This is one of the few fuel-saving technologies that could offer double-digit percentage improvements,§ said Andrew Scott at the UK＊s  Technologies Institute, an industry-government partnership that is helping fund the trial.Shipping moves much of the world＊s goods but is a significant source of air pollution and carbon emissions. A  in 2016 will cut sulphur emissions from 2020 but was heavily criticised for postponing any action on greenhouse gases.※The IMO was first charged with acting by the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and now, two decades later, the IMO＊s latest greenhouse gas emissions reduction plan envisages a further seven-year period to collect data and navel gaze with no commitment to act at the end of all this,§ said Bill Hemmings at the NGO  & Environment.However, some shipping , with the cruise liner firm Hurtigruten ordering a pair of  that will use a battery system to help power them. Another approach is to  to produce electricity. The German company  uses large kites to provide wind power to modern shipping, while another,  in 2010, though Norsepower＊s rotor sails will be larger. Riski said: ※Flettner sailed across the Atlantic and proved they worked. Now the world might be ready to make this real product. I think it will be a no-brainer.§"																																																			
" few years ago, Bj?rk began corresponding with a philosopher whose books she admired. ※hi timothy,§ her first message to him began. ※i wanted to write this letter for a long time.§ She was trying to give a name to her own singular genre, to label her work for posterity before the critics did. She asked him to help define the nature of her art 每 ※not only to define it for me, but also for all my friends, and a generation actually.§It turned out the philosopher, Timothy Morton, was a fan of Bj?rk. Her music, he told her, had been ※a very deep influence on my way of thinking and life in general§. The sense of eerie intimacy with other species, the fusion of moods in her  每 tenderness and horror, weirdness and joy 每 ※is the feeling of ecological awareness§, he said. Morton＊s own work is about the implications of this strange awareness 每 the knowledge of our interdependence with other beings 每 which he believes undermines long-held assumptions about the separation between humanity and nature. For him, this is the defining characteristic of our times, and it is compelling us to change our ※core ideas of what it means to exist, what Earth is, what society is§.Over the past decade, Morton＊s ideas have been spilling into the mainstream. Hans Ulrich Obrist, the artistic director of London＊s Serpentine gallery, and perhaps  in the contemporary art world, is one of his loudest cheerleaders. Obrist told readers of Vogue that Morton＊s books are among the pre-eminent cultural works of our time, and recommends them to many of his own collaborators. The acclaimed artist  has been flying Morton around the world to speak at his major exhibition openings. Excerpts from  were published as part of her 2015 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.Morton＊s terminology is ※slowly infecting all the humanities§, says his friend and fellow thinker Graham Harman. Though many academics have a reputation for writing exclusively for their colleagues down the hall, Morton＊s peculiar conceptual vocabulary 每 ※§, ※the strange stranger§, ※the mesh§ 每 has been picked up by writers in a cornucopia of fields, from literature and epistemology to legal theory and religion. Last year, he was included in  of the 50 most influential living philosophers. His ideas have also percolated into traditional media outlets such as Newsweek, the New Yorker and the New York Times.Part of what makes Morton popular are his attacks on settled ways of thinking. His most frequently cited book, Ecology Without Nature, says we need to scrap the whole concept of ※nature§. He argues that a distinctive feature of our world is the presence of ginormous things he calls ※hyperobjects§ 每 such as global warming or the internet 每 that we tend to think of as abstract ideas because we can＊t get our heads around them, but that are nevertheless as real as hammers. He believes all beings are interdependent, and speculates that everything in the universe has a kind of , from algae and boulders to knives and forks. He asserts that human beings are cyborgs of a kind, since we are made up of all sorts of non-human components; he likes to point out that the very stuff that supposedly makes us  每 our DNA 每 contains a significant amount of genetic material from viruses. He says that we＊re already ruled by a primitive artificial intelligence: industrial capitalism. At the same time, he believes that there are some ※weird experiential chemicals§ in consumerism that will help humanity prevent a full-blown ecological crisis.Morton＊s theories might sound bizarre, but they are in tune with the most earth-shaking idea to emerge in the 21st century: that we are entering a new phase in the history of the planet 每 a phase that Morton and many others now call the ※Anthropocene§.For the past 12,000 years, human beings lived in a geological epoch called the Holocene, known for its relatively stable, temperate climes. It was, you might say, the California of planetary history. But it is coming to an end. Recently, we have begun to alter the Earth so drastically that, according to many scientists, a new epoch is dawning. After the briefest of geological vacations, we seem to be entering a more volatile period.The term Anthropocene, from the Ancient Greek word , meaning ※human§, acknowledges that humans are the major cause of the earth＊s current transformation. Extreme weather, submerged cities, acute resource shortages, vanished species, lakes turned to deserts, nuclear fallout: if there is still human life on earth tens of thousands of years from now,  will have to grapple with the changes we are wreaking today. Morton has noted that 75% of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at this very moment will still be there in half a millennium. That＊s 15 generations away. It will take another 750 generations, or 25,000 years, for most of the those gases to be absorbed into the oceans.The Anthropocene is not only a period of manmade disruption. It is also a moment of blinking self-awareness, in which the human species is becoming conscious of itself as a planetary force. We＊re not only driving global warming and ecological destruction; we that we are.One of Morton＊s most powerful insights is that we are condemned to live with this awareness at all times. It＊s there not only when politicians gather to discuss international environmental agreements, but when we do something as mundane as chat about the weather, pick up a plastic bag at the supermarket or water the lawn. We live in a world with a moral calculus that didn＊t exist before. Now, doing just about anything is an environmental question. That wasn＊t true 60 years ago 每 or at least people weren＊t aware that it was true. Tragically, it is only by despoiling the planet that we have realised just how much a part of it we are.Morton believes that this constitutes a revolution in our understanding of our place in the universe on a par with those fomented by Copernicus, Darwin and Freud. He is just one of thousands of geologists, climate scientists, historians, novelists and journalists writing about this upheaval, but, perhaps better than anyone else, he captures in words the uncanny feeling of being present at the birth of this extreme age.※There you are, turning the ignition of your car,§ he writes. ※And it creeps up on you.§ Every time you fire up your engine you don＊t  to harm the Earth, ※let alone cause the  Event in the four-and-a-half billion-year history of life on this planet§. But ※harm to Earth is precisely what is happening§. Part of what＊s so uncomfortable about this is that our individual acts may be statistically and morally insignificant, but when you multiply them millions and billions of times 每 as they are performed by an entire species 每 they are a collective act of ecological destruction.  isn＊t just occurring over yonder, on the Great Barrier Reef; it＊s happening wherever you switch on the air conditioning. In short, Morton says, ※everything is interconnected§.As Morton＊s work spreads beyond cultural hierophants such as Bj?rk to the pages of major news outlets, he is arguably becoming our most popular guide to the new epoch. Yes, he has some seemingly crazy ideas about what it＊s like to be alive right now 每 but what it＊s like to be alive right now, in the Anthropocene,  pretty crazy.n the course of its young life, the Anthropocene has grown into a concept as grand in its scope as any other world-historical paradigm worth its salt (which, if it＊s sea salt, now includes a good dose of synthetic waste in tiny particles called ). What began as a technical debate within the earth sciences has led, in Morton＊s view, to a confrontation with some of our most basic ways of understanding the world. In the Anthropocene, he writes, we are undergoing ※a traumatic loss of coordinates§.The Anthropocene idea is generally attributed to the Nobel prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen and the biologist Eugene Stoermer, who started popularising the term in 2000. From the outset, many took Crutzen and Stoermer＊s concept seriously, even if they disagreed with it. Since the late 20th century, scientists have viewed geological time as a drama punctuated by great cataclysms, not merely a gradual accretion of incremental changes, and it made sense to see humanity itself as the latest cataclysm.Imagine geologists from a future civilisation examining the layers of rock that are in the slow process of forming today, the way we examine the rock strata that formed as the dinosaurs died off. That civilisation will see evidence of our sudden (in geological terms) impact on the planet 每 including fossilised plastics and layers both of carbon, from burning carbon fuels, and of radioactive particles, from nuclear testing and explosions 每 just as clearly as we see evidence of the dinosaurs＊ rapid demise. We can already observe these layers forming today.For a couple of years, a lively debate over the usefulness of the concept unfolded. Detractors argued that humanity＊s ※geological signal§ was not yet loud enough to justify the coronation of a new epoch, or that the term had no scientific use. Supporters wondered when they should date the Anthropocene＊s start. To the advent of agriculture, many millennia ago? To the invention of the steam engine in the 18th century and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution? To 5.29am on 16 July 1945, the moment when  exploded over the New Mexico desert? (Morton, in his all-embracing way, treats each of these moments as pivotal.) Then, in 2002, Crutzen set out his arguments in the scientific journal Nature. The idea of a moment in planetary history in which human influence was predominant seemed to tie together so many disparate developments 每 from retreating glaciers to fresh thinking about the limits of capitalism 每 that the term quickly spread to other earth sciences, and then beyond.Since then, at least three academic journals devoted to the Anthropocene have been founded, several universities have established formal research groups to ponder its implications, Stanford students have started a popular podcast titled , and thousands of articles and books have been written on the subject, in fields ranging from economics to poetry.Some thinkers object to the term, arguing that it reinforces the human-centric view of the world that has led us to the verge of ecological catastrophe. Others say the blame for the despoliation of the Earth should be laid at the feet not of humanity in general, but of (predominantly white, western and male) capitalism. Several alternative designations have been minted, including ※Capitalocene§, but none has caught on. They don＊t have the disquieting existential ring of Anthropocene, which stresses both our culpability and our fragility as humans.Around 2011, the Anthropocene ※began to crop up regularly in newspapers for the first time§, according to the scholar Jeremy Davies＊s recent history of the concept. The BBC, the Economist, National Geographic, Science and others covered the idea. Planetary changes had increasingly led journalists to set their environmental reporting in the context of geohistory 每 atmospheric carbon dioxide levels of 400 parts per million? , three million years ago 每 and the Anthropocene became a useful shorthand for placing human activity in the perspective of geological deep time. For Morton, who had recently begun writing about it, it captured his concern with the way beings of different kinds, including humans, depend on each other for their existence 每 a fact the various calamities of the Anthropocene drove home.In 2014, the Anthropocene was inducted into the Oxford English Dictionary, and last year, the epoch was formally endorsed by a working group within the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the official keeper of geological time. As a tentative start date, they chose the year 1950, when one of the clearest markers of human activity shows up globally in the earth＊s crust: plutonium isotopes from widespread nuclear testing. The working group＊s announcement was considered so significant that it made the front page of the Guardian. (Across the media, the Anthropocene is now used to frame everything from fiction reviews to discussions of the Donald Trump presidency.) As Jan Zalasiewicz, the chair of the group and one of the leading scientists studying the Anthropocene, said at the time, the new epoch ※sets a different trajectory for the Earth system§ and we are only now ※realising the scale and permanence of the change§.There have been periods of intense climate fluctuation coupled with mass extinction before. The most recent was 66m years ago, when a meteorite six miles in diameter struck what is now the Yucat芍n Peninsula. The impact released an estimated 2m times the energy of the most powerful atomic bomb ever detonated, altering the planet＊s atmosphere and wiping out three-quarters of its species. But that was a comparatively simple event, which the physical sciences are well-equipped to understand.To make sense of an epochal change that is being driven by human activity, we need more than geology, meteorology and chemistry. If this is a reckoning for our species, we need an intellectual guide 每 someone to tell us just how panicked we should be, and how our recognition that we are transforming the planet will change us in turn.he awareness we＊ve gained in the Anthropocene is not generally a happy one. Many environmentalists now warn of impending global catastrophe and urge industrial societies to change course. Morton stakes out a more iconoclastic position. Instead of raising the ecological alarm like some Paul Revere of the apocalypse, he advocates what he calls ※dark ecology,§ which holds that the much-feared catastrophe has, in fact, already occurred.Morton means not only that irreversible global warming is under way, but also something more wide-reaching. ※We Mesopotamians§ 每 as he calls the past 400 or so generations of humans living in agricultural and industrial societies 每 thought that we were simply manipulating other entities (by farming and engineering, and so on) in a vacuum, as if we were lab technicians and they were in some kind of giant petri dish called ※nature§ or ※the environment§. In the Anthropocene, Morton says, we must wake up to the fact that we never stood apart from or controlled the non-human things on the planet, but have always been thoroughly bound up with them. We can＊t even burn, throw or flush things away without them coming back to us in some form, such as harmful pollution. Our most cherished ideas about nature and the environment 每 that they are separate from us, and relatively stable 每 have been destroyed.Morton likens this realisation to detective stories in which the hunter realises he is hunting himself (his favourite examples are  and Oedipus Rex). ※Not all of us are prepared to feel sufficiently creeped out§ by this epiphany, he says. But there＊s another twist: even though humans have caused the Anthropocene, we cannot control it. ※Oh, my God!§ Morton exclaimed to me in mock horror at one point. ※My attempt to escape the web of fate  the web of fate.§The chief reason that we are waking up to our entanglement with the world we have been destroying, Morton says, is our encounter with the reality of hyperobjects 每 the term he coined to describe things such as ecosystems and black holes, which are ※massively distributed in time and space§ compared to individual humans. Hyperobjects might not seem to be objects in the way that, say, billiard balls are, but they are equally real, and we are now bumping up against them consciously for the first time. Global warming might have first appeared to us as a bit of funny local weather, then as a series of independent manifestations (an unusually torrential flood here, a deadly heatwave there), but now we see it as a unified phenomenon, of which extreme weather events and the disruption of the old seasons are only elements.It is through hyperobjects that we initially confront the Anthropocene, Morton argues. One of his most influential books, itself titled , examines the experience of being caught up in 每 indeed, being an intimate part of 每 these entities, which are too big to wrap our heads around, and far too big to control. We can experience hyperobjects such as climate in their local manifestations, or through data produced by scientific measurements, but their scale and the fact that we are trapped inside them means that we can never fully know them. Because of such phenomena, we are living in a time of quite literally unthinkable change.This leads Morton to one of his most sweeping claims: that the Anthropocene is forcing a revolution in human thought. Advances in science are now underscoring how ※enmeshed§ we are with other beings 每 from the microbes that account for roughly half the cells in our bodies, to our reliance for survival on the Earth＊s . At the same time, hyperobjects, in their unwieldy enormity, alert us to the absolute boundaries of science, and therefore the limits of human mastery. Science can only take us so far. This means changing our relationship with the other entities in the universe 每 whether animal, vegetable or mineral 每 from one of exploitation through science to one of solidarity in ignorance. If we fail to do this, we will continue to wreak havoc on the planet, threatening the ways of life we hold dear, and even our very existence. In contrast to utopian fantasies that we will be saved by the rise of  or some other new technology, the Anthropocene teaches us that we can＊t transcend our limitations or our reliance on other beings. We can only live with them.That might sound gloomy, but Morton glimpses in it a liberation. If we give up the delusion of controlling everything around us, we might refocus ourselves on the pleasure we take in other beings and life itself. Enjoyment, Morton believes, might be the thing that turns us on to a new kind of politics. ※You think ecologically tuned life means being all efficient and pure,§ the tweet pinned to the top of  reads. ※Wrong. It means you can have a disco in every room of your house.§Those words are typical of his thought, which often sets out from the dismal familiar, but then veers wildly off the beaten track. ※There＊s something truly hopeful in his work,§ Hans Ulrich Obrist says of Morton. ※Hope and maybe even optimism are somehow in there.§ Morton has a story about converting his home outside Houston, where he holds a chair at Rice University, to wind-generated electricity. After a day or two of ※feeling very righteous and holy,§ he realised he could now have ※full-on strobes and decks and people partaying for hours and hours, all day, every day,§ while causing far less damage to the planet. ※And that＊s the ecological future, actually.§ne Saturday morning last autumn,I went looking for Morton at the Serpentine Galleries＊ annual festival of ideas, where he was to speak later that day. Over the previous few weeks, he had been in Seoul to help Olafur Eliasson open a solo exhibition; in Singapore, to speak at the Future Cities conference; in Brussels, to give a talk titled ※§ in a public park at night (he said 250 people showed up); at the University of Exeter, where he outlined ※rocking§, his new theory of action, which he described as ※a queering of the theistic categories of active versus passive§; in Rome, where he spent his time, among other things, drinking martinis; and in Paris, where he went raving with his friend Ingrid and was so overcome with emotion and exhaustion that he spent some of the night lying in the middle of the dancefloor.If you had to select an avatar for the Anthropocene, Morton might be an appropriate choice. He has arctic-blue eyes that at once shock and appear shocked. Combined with a slight pudginess that suggests physical vulnerability, an eczematic redness to his face, and a thistle of thin blond hair, he looks as if he has survived some kind of fallout. Indeed, he is something of a man afflicted. Among other things, he suffers from severe , severe depression, severe migraines, and, it seemed to me over the course of our conversations, the occasional bout of mild paranoia. Obrist, who has recorded more than 2,500 hours of interviews with artists and philosophers, told me that Morton is the only one who became ※so emotional that actually he starts to cry§.(They had been discussing mass extinction.)Earlier in the year, when I had spoken to Morton on video calls, he had been ebullient. Now, sitting at the back of the gallery＊s restaurant, which had been converted into a performance hall, he seemed to be running on fumes. He had already published 14 essays that year, while continuing work on his two upcoming books. In the next few weeks, he was speaking in Chicago, at Yale, in Seoul (again), Munich and, finally, convening with members of Nasa＊s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to contemplate the kinds of messages we should be sending into space on a potential reboot of . (The original, launched in 1977, sent two spacecraft hurtling beyond our solar system; each contained a 12-inch gold-plated record engraved with sounds and images representing humanity and other earthly beings.) By the end of 2016, as he later wrote , Morton had racked up 350,000 air miles.Morton＊s itinerary was an index of how popular the notion of the Anthropocene has become, and how deeply his approach to it resonates with our increasingly disquieting experience of the world. Poring over his books, or speaking to him in person, one starts to suspect that what is outlandish in his thinking and personality actually reflects something truly strange about the world. Over lunch, Morton ordered a chicken salad sandwich 每 an earlier experiment with veganism had lapsed 每 and we discussed the development of his thought. As he ate, I was reminded of a recent report that , which, in the words of Jan Zalasiewicz, means that their carcasses have now been ※fossilised in thousands of landfill sites and on street corners around the world§. That thought leads immediately to another one: about the bacterial ※superbugs§ we have created through widespread use of antibiotics, especially in industrial livestock production. From there, it＊s only a short jump to thinking about other strange phenomena in our new epoch, like , and changes in the earth＊s rotation caused by melting ice sheets. Once you start listing these unsettling Anthropocene facts, there＊s no end to it.It＊s possible, when one encounters Morton for the first or second time, to wonder if there＊s something concocted about his hippie disposition, his emotionality, his intellectual flair. But his childhood friends and relatives say that his visceral engagement with ecology, and his academic prowess, go back to his childhood. Morton was born in north-west London, in 1968, in the midst of a period when a growing awareness of ecological threat still went hand in hand with the sense that people could change the world for the better, possibly under the influence of LSD. After his parents, who were both concert violinists, divorced in the late 1970s, his father sailed off on a Greenpeace protest trawler; his mother was a committed feminist who was active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.From early on, Morton was an academic standout. He received the top scholarship at the elite St Paul＊s School in London five years in a row, and then went to Oxford to read English. He got the highest marks in his subject across the university in his first-year exams, and a first in his finals. Doing well academically was important to Morton, but eventually he came to the realisation that it＊s ※actually secondary to this other thing, called being alive§. His life took on something of the shape his work would later adopt. It was about more than accumulating knowledge; it was also about pursuing pleasure and intimacy. In his second year as an undergraduate, he and his roommate, Mark Payne, who is now a classicist at the University of Chicago, would ※do acid and listen to Butthole Surfers and talk about Blake§. (Payne says they did acid and talked about Milton.) He also fell in love for the first time. As a graduate student, Morton wore his hair long, with a suede jacket, and decked himself out in beads. His PhD thesis, which is recognised as an important contribution to the study of Romanticism, showed that the vegetarianism of Percy and Mary Shelley was intimately entwined with their politics and art. Paul Hamilton, who supervised some of Morton＊s graduate work, told me that, when it came to the Shelleys, Morton ※changed the lights for everyone§.Despite the success of his dissertation, Morton struggled to land an academic position, and even contemplated killing himself. Eventually, he found a job at the University of Colorado, Boulder, before moving on, in 2003, to the University of California in Davis, north-east of San Francisco. Being in northern California seemed to season his thought, and he began focusing on explicitly ecological questions, such as what we write about when we write about nature. In a canny bit of self-branding, he also took to calling himself Professor of Literature and Environment.Over the next few years, Morton published his book challenging the idea of ※nature§, as well as a follow-up asking what it means for us to rely in unfathomably complex ways on a countless number of other beings. He also joined a small, contentious philosophical movement called , which holds that every being, including humans, can only ever grasp the world in its own limited ways. (In other words, we will never know what flies know, and vice versa.) Then, in 2012, Morton left California for his current chair at Rice, one of the most well-regarded universities in America.With the security of tenure and the successive infusions of Buddhism and OOO into his thinking, Morton started to write in a more riffing, personal style. His talk of discos in his wind-powered home and the cringey way he elongates ※partaying§ aren＊t incidental to his project. ※Inevitably, ecological awareness has this kind of 70s flavour to it,§ he says. It＊s an aesthetic he embraces, ※in all of its flared weirdness§. There＊s a bell-bottomed capaciousness to his intellectual style, too. He may well be the only person ever to grace a list of the most influential living philosophers and have a songwriting credit on an album that reached No 4 in the UK charts ( by , from 1994).He has followed in the footsteps of thinkers such as Jacques Derrida and Edward Said in giving the prestigious , at the University of California in Irvine 每 but he has also performed at Glastonbury, playing music for fire-juggling performance artists, and served as a consultant on the Steve Coogan series The Trip to Italy. Although he＊s about to publish a book attempting to fuse dark ecology with Marxism (※The tweak is pretty intense, and not everyone＊s going to like it,§ he says), he also has one forthcoming for Pelican books, Being Ecological, which is meant to enchant the general public. The first sentence is: ※This book contains no ecological facts whatsoever.§ Though several of his books are dedicated to the customary people (spouse, children, siblings), he has also dedicated one to his cat, the late Allan Whiskersworth. One of the most engrossing posts on his blog, which he updates regularly, is  drawn on rooftops so they can be discovered via Google Earth. He＊s deep into Shambhala Buddhism and has circumambulated Mount Kailash in Tibet. Not long ago, he received a very moving Tarot reading.If people find most of this ridiculous, all the better. ※I like to think of myself as the corniest, most awful thing you could possibly imagine,§ he told me. He has achieved the usual trappings of academic success; now that he＊s through the metaphorical metal detectors of polite society, he has a different aim. ※I can get quite well known, and then I can unleash this kind of anarchist-hippie thing that I＊ve been holding like a very precious liquid, carefully, without spilling any, for years and years and years,§ he said. ※And now I＊m going to pour it everywhere.§hen it was time for his talk at the Serpentine, Morton appeared in a tight-fitting, silver Versace shirt of the sort a camp Bond villain might wear. His lecture was titled ※§.※You wouldn＊t believe how many philosophers are afraid of movement,§ he began. He went on to discuss two strands of thought in the work of the philosopher Hegel. One problem with Hegel, Morton said, ※the problem I call macro-Hegel, is that macro-Hegel makes the slinky move  the stairs, improbably. And at the top of the stairs, like the killer in Psycho, is waiting, drum roll, you guessed it, white western patriarchy in the guise of the Prussian state.§ (I had not guessed this; should I have?) ※So macro-Hegel blows it.§It seemed an odd way to approach a lecture to a motley crew of artists, activists, students and musicians. Even as someone with an interest in Morton＊s work, I soon felt bored and distracted. The man standing next to me, an American scholar with an acerbic sense of humour, rolled his eyes and whispered a comment to the effect of ※What is this bullshit?§Despite Morton＊s popularity, this isn＊t an uncommon response to his work. The Morton detractors with whom I spoke accused him of misunderstanding contemporary science, like quantum mechanics and set theory, and then claiming his distortions as support for his wild ideas. They shared a broad critique that reminded me of the sceptical adage, ※If you open your mind too far, your brains will fall out.§ The slurry of interesting ideas in Morton＊s work doesn＊t hold together under scrutiny, they say. The philosopher Ray Brassier, who was once associated with OOO, has charged Morton and his blogging  with generating ※an online orgy of stupidity§.Other critics, especially on the left, complain that Morton＊s conception of the Anthropocene glosses over issues of race, class, gender and colonialism by blaming the entire species for the damage inflicted by a privileged minority. The focus on the human enshrined in the term Anthropocene is a particular target for critics. By referring to humans as a unified whole, they argue that Morton effaces distinctions between the affluent west and the other members of humanity, many of whom were living in a state of ecological catastrophe long before the notion of the Anthropocene became trendy on campuses in Europe and North America. Others say that Morton＊s notion of politics is too woolly, or that the last thing we need when facing ecological challenges are abstract musings about the nature of objects.Morton＊s defenders, however, see him as something of a  for the Anthropocene: his writing has value, even if it doesn＊t always stand up to philosophical scrutiny. ※No one in a philosophy department is going to be taking Tim Morton seriously,§ Claire Colebrook, a professor of English at Pennsylvania State University who has worked extensively on the Anthropocene, told me. But she teaches Morton＊s work to undergraduates and they love it. ※Why? Because they＊re like, ＆Shut up and give me an idea!＊§Not everything that Morton said to me in the course of our conversations struck me as philosophically or ecologically plausible. (※You and me, and our computers and that painting behind you and maybe one of the pigeons in the street 每 we＊re going to get together and make a little anarchist collective, and the focus of this anarchist collective will be reading, um, the letters of Beethoven.§) But what attracts many to his ideas are not their cogency so much as their profusion and playfulness. Hans Ulrich Obrist and the artists Philippe Parreno and Olafur Eliasson all used the same word to describe his oeuvre: it＊s a ※toolbox§, they said, from which they can pluck useful ideas.That toolbox may be useful to the rest of us, too. As global warming and other features of the Anthropocene intensify, our experience of this grave new age is bound to become ever weirder and more fraught. When that happens, more and more people are likely to seek out writings 每 such as Morton＊s 每 that echo their experiences of alienation, as well as their yearning for hope. Some other thinkers seem to believe we can tidy up the world if we just have better, more logical, more rigorous ideas. Morton says we can tidy up our ideas all we want, but the world is going to remain a fundamentally messy place that will always resist our philosophical decluttering. What we need to do instead is get comfortable with this weirdness. During one of our earliest conversations, I told Morton I appreciated his work, to the extent I thought I understood it. ※I think I understand it too, sometimes,§ he repli"																																																			
d.here＊s nothing like the prospectof an authoritarian strongman to make intellectuals	 hippies	 and	 above all	 hippie intellectuals appear hopelessly ineffectual. Compared to organising protests or setting up a recurring donation to the 	 talk of deep time or of effacing the false ontological divide between humanity and nature risks seeming rather fatuous.In November	 the week after the election of Donald Trump	 Morton flew to New York to confab with the Nasa group about what a new Golden Record might contain. He was devastated by Trump＊s victory	 but not necessarily surprised that America had opted for what he called the political equivalent of a diet of vicodin and cinnamon buns. In his hotel room	 he had a ※private weeping session§ while reading the David Malouf novel Fly Away Peter. Later	 he went for a bite of sushi 每 in which mercury from coal-fired power plants	 smelting metals and burning trash tends to accumulate	  每 and got swept up in a large crowd. ※I was in that first protest	 man	§ he told me. ※I was in that first fucking anti-Trump protest at Trump Tower.§ He quipped 	 and to the Nasa meeting	 that he wanted to put the president-elect on the next Voyager probe.I wondered how potent Morton＊s animistic politics would seem under the new dispensation. The day after his talk at the Serpentine in the autumn	 I had eaten lunch with him	 the performance artist Kathelin Gray and John Polk Allen	 AKA Johnny Dolphin	 the prime mover behind 	 a planetary microcosm built inside what is essentially a gigantic test tube in the Arizona desert. The conversation	 in the course of meandering from places on the globe with special energy (the Himalayas	 ) to the ※lunatic asylum for clever people§ that is Oxford	 turned toward solidarity with other species.※I＊ve always called other things ＆people＊	§ Gray said. ※My Native American friends are very happy about that.§※How could you  call them people?§ Morton responded.Gray told a story of snakes she had known. Morton	 evidently moved	 put his hand on his chest. ※You had  friends called Snakey?§ he said. ※That＊s wonderful.§This had all sounded a bit ludicrous	 even before Trump got elected. But somewhere in these schmaltzy attempts to express their affinity with other creatures was a genuine desire to move towards the sort of radically pluralist politics that Morton advocates. ※Don＊t hide under a rock	 for heaven＊s sake	§ Morton had said to me at one point. ※Go out in the street and start making any and as many kinds of political affiliations with as many kinds of beings	 human or otherwise	 that you possibly can	 with a view to creating a more non-violent and just	 for everybody	 ecological world.§ It was hard to argue with those aims. We can＊t debate with other species	 but the Anthropocene makes it clear that we need to include their wellbeing among our goals.Morton＊s own political emphasis seemed to change after the election. Wind-powered house parties and interspecies reading groups were out. Now	 the whole point	 he said	 was ※to freakin＊ crush these fascists over and over and over again§.Still	 the Anthropocene isn＊t going away just because a venal troll in a baggy suit is sitting in the White House. The build-up of carbon in the air and nitrogen in the soil; the acidification of the oceans and the desertification of once-fertile lands; the counterpane of radioactive isotopes (from nuclear testing) and plastic (from consumer packaging) that blankets the globe; the species after species extinguished 每 the list of dramatic changes to the planet goes on. The politics of today may be more urgent than ever	 but the need for a politics of tomorrow hasn＊t gone away.A few days after the election	 Morton regained his sense of humour and began to laugh about the president-elect	 ※this little orange guy with a huge	 yellow pile of Cheetos on his head§.

" recently spent some time walking around Washington DC, where I live, with an aethalometer sticking out of my shirt collar. I carried the device, which measures air pollution, around with me like a pet monkey as I walked in a city park, drove on the city＊s circular beltway and picked up my kids from school. It was sadly eye-opening because it confirmed what I have long suspected: my city is a polluted place.The monitor, borrowed from Columbia University＊s  in Palisades, New York, measures black carbon, a byproduct of car engines and other fuel- burning processes. Its name comes from the Greek word meaning ※to blacken with soot§. And that＊s exactly what happened.The spindly machine measured high readings of 6,000 nanograms per cubic meter while I drove around, even during off-peak hours. More shockingly, I recorded equally high values just outside my daughter＊s school, where cars and buses idle, waiting to pick up students. Much of the pollution there is generated by diesel fuel, which has been shown to shorten life spans around the world by causing cardiovascular and pulmonary problems. Worldwide, fine particulate matter, of which black carbon is a component, is blamed for  annually.Scientists have long considered the lungs as vulnerable to air pollution. Only recently have they come to realise the role of the nose as a pathway to the brain; the extent of the nose-brain connection was only illuminated in 2003, when researchers in smog-choked Mexico City found brain lesions on stray dogs.Unfortunately for city dwellers, the closer we live to these roads, the higher our risk of autism, stroke and cognitive decline in ageing, although the exact reasons haven＊t been teased out. Scientists suspect it has something to do with fine particles causing tissue inflammation and altering gene expression in the brain＊s immune cells.※I hold my breath when I＊m behind a diesel bus,§ Michelle Block, a neurobiologist who studies pollution＊s effects on microglial cells at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me.Regardless of whether people know about pollution, its effects are being felt in other ways too. In  by economists George MacKerron and Susana Mourato at the London School of Economics, ※life satisfaction§ fell significantly 每 half a point on an 11-point scale 每 for each additional 10 micrograms per cubic metre of nitrogen dioxide pollution, also a common byproduct of diesel engines.Because I am strangely driven to probe the unhealthy aspects of my life, I also walked around my city wearing a portable  (EEG) device on my head. I wanted to know how easily I could attain  (indicating a calm, focused state of mind) by walking in various parts of the city, including a park.Research has shown that people who live in cities may suffer more psychological stress than people who live in rural areas. For a study published in Nature in 2011, Jens Pruessner and colleagues at the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim found a 21% increase in anxiety disorders, a 39% increase in mood disorders and a doubled risk of schizophrenia in city dwellers. Urban living was linked to 每 the fear centre 每 and in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, a key region for regulating fear and stress.Meanwhile, a found that people living near industrial ※grey areas§ reported less optimism. This may sound trivial, but optimism is associated with healthier behaviours (such as a willingness to exercise), lower levels of fat in the blood and mental resilience, or the ability to recover from stress.I uploaded the data from my EEG to a California-based website that read it, fed it into an algorithm, and sent me back this dejected message about my lack of alphas: ※This indicates that in this state you were actively processing information and, perhaps, that you should relax more often!§Both my local park and my house sit under the flightpath of a busy airport, and noise pollution is yet another well-proven source of stress. I decided to measure the noise. This I did in my very own backyard, using an iPhone app. I found out that the jets flying overhead every two minutes cranked out average decibel levels between 55 and 60 but sometimes spiking much higher (60 decibels is high enough to drown out normal speech). These are the same levels linked to stress-related disease and increased use of anti-anxiety medication in European studies. I bought noise-cancelling headphones. And I thought seriously about moving to the Rocky Mountains.But before we all ditch our cities to camp out in a hay bale, it＊s worth remembering that there are some excellent ways to counter the ill effects of crowded, Euclidean, monochromatic, loud modern life. Because, let＊s face it, there are still some rather nice things about living in cities. And the fact is, more and more of us live in them. Globally, as of 2008,  than outside them. By 2050,  will pile in, leading one US anthropologist, Jason Vargo, to suggest a new name for our species: . Learning to make cities livable will be one of the greatest public health challenges of this century.One clear step is the need to tackle air pollution. Health experts in the UK recently during morning rush hour. A better solution would be to regulate the polluters. Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City within the next 10 years.Another antidote to noise, particulates and greyness is both delightful and affordable: trees. For humans, urban trees provide not just aesthetic pleasure but health benefits. Trees soak up air pollution, create cooling and provide a brain-tingling array of colours, textures and scents. The birds they shelter provide us with birdsong, which in turn is linked to feelings of wellbeing.Consider the example of Toronto, Canada. The city  (?4.3bn). A  showed the higher a neighbourhood＊s tree density, the lower the incidence of heart and metabolic disease, and estimated that the health boost to those living on blocks with 11 more trees than average was equivalent to a C$20,000 gain in median income.I hope to become so lucky, since Washington DC and partner nonprofits have been trying to plant at least 8,600 trees per year in an effort to  in the next two decades. New York City recently completed a campaign to plant a million trees, and Los Angeles, Shanghai, Denver and Dubai are in the middle of similar projects.I envision soon nestling under a sprawling oak and removing all of my monitoring devices. It will just be me and the tree, and I won＊t need a machine to tell me I feel better."																																																			
"As climate change pushes marine species towards cooler waters, and the fishing industry expands around the globe, the tropics are emptying out, a leading fisheries expert has warned.The federal government is expected to release its new management plan for marine reserves in coming weeks, after . However Dr Daniel Pauly has called for the creation of more, saying they are the only realistic form of mitigation to the current crisis.Pauly, principal investigator at the Sea Around Us research organisation, said it was unknown whether the ※explosion§ of fishing industries or global warming was having the biggest impact on fish stocks, but both needed to be addressed.※The depth, the distance from the coast, all of these were factors which protected fish. Now we go everywhere ＃ now nothing protects the fish,§ he said during an observation tour of Darwin＊s tropical harbour.※Climate change is something that is already being perceived by fish. It＊s already happening and they＊re already moving,§ he said.Warmer waters were pushing marine species away from the equator at a rate of about 50km per decade as they followed the ideal temperatures for feeding and spawning.※In temperate areas you will have the fish coming from a warmer area, and another one leaving. You＊ll have a lot of transformation but they will actually 每 at least in terms of fishery 每 adapt. In the tropics you don＊t have the replacement, you have only fish leaving.§Research by Pauly and the Sea Around Us has repeatedly called for greater focus on fisheries data from a global perspective rather than local, to properly assess the impact of commercial competition and climate change.※Locally the work must be done also, but you can get insights if you look at the global issue,§ he said.Sea Around Us research has found that while the lack of industrial-scale fishing meant the problem wasn＊t as bad in , there were signs of a decline.Pauly said there were only a few nations 每 of which Australia was one 每 that studied the species loss in the tropics. ※You can have entire fisheries collapsing without knowing because you cannot separate the global warming-induced migration from the reduction due to fishing, or even pollution. So we will never know for sure why this or that collapse has occurred, except in a few cases.§In 2012 the Gillard government established 42 marine reserves around Australia, but these were effectively suspended by the Tony Abbott-led Coalition government, which commissioned a review. In 2016 the review reports  每 advice at odds with Pauly＊s views 每 in order to balance competing environmental, commercial, and socioeconomic interests.A new management plan for marine reserves, based on the recommendations, is due to be delivered by the commonwealth Department of Environment in coming months.Pauly said creating more marine reserves was the only real option for governments to mitigate the damage in the meantime, and aiding population growth in particular areas would spill over into fishing zones.※The only thing you can do 每 and it＊s only mitigation 每 is keep the population big in the sea,§ he said.Populations bounce back quickly when fishing stops, Pauly said, and a higher variance of individual fish assisted a natural evolution of greater tolerance to warmer temperatures.※Marine protected areas, marine areas, are one mitigating factor, and it＊s the only thing you can do.§Pauly said marine reserves needed to exist along side good management, which Australia already had with ※outstanding policies§ like maximum yields.Seasonal closures weren＊t enough, added Prof Jessica Meeuwig, of the University of Western Australia＊s marine futures lab.Large breeding fish were still taken during open seasons, drastically upsetting population balances, and partial protections in place were inadequate.※It＊s like having a Ferrari with a lawnmower engine 每 there＊s no grunt,§ she said.※That＊s one of the big things we need to start having a conversation about. When you say marine park, that it＊s actually a marine park that＊s protected. The Great Barrier Reef marine park, 67% of it is open to fishing, and Ningaloo has 66% open to fishing.§※It gives people a false sense of security because they think they＊ve protected something when they haven＊t.§"

"t the age of three, Margaux Giraudon developed something akin to a smoker＊s cough. Thereafter, she became all too familiar with the inside of her doctor＊s office in .For years, her father Nicolas Giraudon was told the same thing by doctors: ※Your daughter is sensitive to changes in the weather.§ Eventually she grew so ill that she was hooked up to breathing machines in the hospital for three days, inhaling medicine delivered in a mist. At that point, Giraudon decided it was time for the family to return to his native France.※She was scared 每 she didn＊t know what was going on, and she saw the look on our faces,§ Giraudon recalls. ※Her mother and I were completely shocked. When you have children, you want the best for them; you want to protect them as much as possible.§For Giraudon, those three days transformed  from an international city bustling with excitement and opportunity into a death trap that was slowly poisoning his family. Born on the island, Margaux had developed , which caused her lung capacity to fall by nearly a third compared to other children her age.While Hong Kong＊s air pollution rarely commands the attention of the toxic cloud that frequently covers northern , dubbed the , the air is anything but clean here. Levels of cancer-causing pollutants have exceeded World Health Organization standards for over 15 years, rising to more than five times acceptable levels at its peak.As far back as 2013, the government called air pollution the . Despite awareness of the dangers, this notoriously pro-business city has moved at a glacial pace in tackling the problem, commissioning study after study but taking little concrete action.The fast-paced business world is what originally brought Giraudon to Hong Kong in 2009. In the six years before his daughter became sick, he didn＊t experience any noticeable effects from air pollution. The 42-year-old media executive went hiking in the mountains around the city and jogged all over his new home, realising a lifelong dream of working in Asia. He didn＊t buy air purifiers, dismissing the costly machines as a marketing trick. After his daughter＊s hospital stay, however, Giraudon transformed completely. He bought a device to measure air pollution and became obsessed. Every room in his house was fitted with an expensive air purifier, and he checked the air quality constantly.※My flat in Hong Kong felt like living in a spaceship,§ he says. ※I was measuring the level of pollution 24 hours a day, measuring humidity to combat mould, to make sure everything was within acceptable levels.§Giraudon would hear his neighbour＊s children coughing at night, and knew they didn＊t have air filters.※I became the guy nobody invited for dinner,§ he recalls with a sigh. ※Especially the newcomers, who were all really excited to arrive in Hong Kong 每 and then I would come with my readings and warnings. People didn＊t want to hear about it.§Giraudon began taking his testing equipment to his daughter＊s school and was shocked to discover the air was terrible. But he also found another group of people who did not want to hear about the problem: school officials. He launched a campaign to clean the air there, and was met with resistance at every turn.The city is notorious for capitalism run amok, and the authorities have long preferred the status quo or very slow change 每 a perpetual complaint among activists.In a sign that ignorance about the health effects of pollution extends to the very top, one former chief executive : ※Life expectancy [in Hong Kong] is the highest on earth, higher than that in Japan these days. It must be our air.§ The year he made that statement, pollution levels were more than four times WHO recommendations.While equipping every room of a school or home with filters can clean the air, it＊s only a plaster over the larger problem: tackling pollution at the source.Emissions from cars and container ships are some of the largest contributors to Hong Kong＊s smog. Old diesel vehicles still number in the tens of thousands, and , one of the busiest in the world, are allowed to burn high sulphur fuel right up until they dock. Power plants, meanwhile, rely almost entirely on fossil fuel, with coal supplying . Much of Hong Kong＊s pollution, however, wafts across the border from China. About 60-70% of , according to a study commissioned by the city＊s Environmental Protection Department. In winter, when the wind direction tends to blow more pollutants towards Hong Kong, as much as 77% of dust in the air comes from China.Hong Kong has signed a series of agreements with Guangdong province directly to the north 每 but they are unenforceable, stymying efforts by the local government and activists to have a meaningful impact. In the meantime, the health impact on Hong Kong＊s population is severe.There were  last year because of air pollution, according to Hong Kong University＊s school of public health. In the first month of 2017 researchers estimate there were more than 300,000 doctor＊s visits linked to smog.A landmark study last year found that air pollution  by 22% in Hong Kong. An increase of just 10 micrograms of PM2.5 每 a tiny airborne particulate  每 heightened the risk of dying of breast cancer by 80%.With a government that is scarcely accountable to Hong Kong residents, environmental campaigners are fighting an uphill battle to contain even local sources of pollution. The city＊s leader, known as the chief executive, is elected by a 1,200-strong committee made up of elites, where  has considerable sway over the votes. Only half the seats in the legislature are directly elected, with the remaining lawmakers returned by professional organisations that overwhelmingly support Beijing.Tanya Chan, chairman of the environmental affairs panel in the city＊s legislature, recalls constituents clamouring for the government to clean up the air, fearing for the health of their children. ※The government can try harder and they should push harder,§ she says. ※We need to be improving fuel standards and expanding the use of electric vehicles.§Chan is in favour of introducing congestion pricing to some of the city＊s most clogged districts, but lawmakers are hamstrung by a political system where all power related to government spending or levies requires approval from the chief executive.※He is only accountable to a small election committee, where most come from business sectors,§ Chan says. ※We have no choice but to breathe this air.§The city＊s air quality standards (government targets for clean air) remained unchanged for 27 years before eventually being updated in 2014. But they still fall short of WHO guidelines.※We need to improve our air quality standard to catch up with international standards,§ Chan adds. ※That process has been a bit slow and I hope the government will do more, especially for the PM2.5s.§The Environmental Bureau , nearly seven years after it began monitoring the harmful pollutant, and only after Beijing began publishing the same information.But locals are increasingly concerned, and hungry for information.On a recent evening, tucked away on the second floor of a sleepy cafe, about two dozen people gather to receive a crash course in Hong Kong＊s pollution situation. The mostly young crowd are a mix of office workers, salesmen and artists, all united by their previous ignorance of the dangers in the air and their anger at the officials they say kept them in the dark.Leading the meeting is Patrick Fung, chief executive of the . The 31-year-old has become the face of the fight for better air quality in the city, and while he＊s often dressed in tailored shirts and trousers to ensure his message is taken seriously, his shoulder-length hair, goatee and glasses evoke an image of environmental activists from years past.In many ways the former advertising executive lives by the phrase: ※There＊s no such thing as bad publicity,§ taking any opportunity to counter the narrative that dirty air is a fact of life.※I＊m just advertising something else now: cleaner air,§ Fung says. ※It＊s the most challenging product to sell: everyone wants it but it＊s not just something you buy, some sacrifices need to be made.§On the most basic level, Fung and his fellow campaigners want the government to update its air quality targets. The  for annual air pollution are three and a half times higher than those .But beyond that are a host of problems unique to Hong Kong: the city is one of the , with its most crowded district nearly four times more packed than Islington, London＊s densest borough. Narrow streets surrounded by high-rises have created ※street canyons§, which can trap pollutants between buildings.Fung＊s group advocates for large swaths of the city＊s main thoroughfares to be turned over to pedestrians, similar to  or plans for . Cindy Wong listens to Fung＊s speech with rapt attention, bombarded with information she had never heard before.※People in Hong Kong spend all their time worrying: prices are expensive, rent is high, salaries are low, so no one has time to care about pollution,§ she says after the meeting. ※The government should have a strict policy to control pollution; the government should lead and people will follow.§※The air seems much better in foreign countries, in Europe,§ Wong adds. Although she＊s never been, she often watched with envy as travel programs highlighted tree-lined streets and plentiful gardens in cities abroad.※A lot of Hong Kongers know about the poor air quality, but they feel powerless,§ Fung says. ※It＊s an issue of justice 每 this should be a basic right.§After five years heading the environmental NGO, he says he can tell the air quality by his nose alone. ※Everyone in this office can tell just by the smell of the air.§ The vast majority of Hong Kong people don＊t have air purifiers, and those that do tend to be wealthier and better educated, according to Peter Brar, manager at air quality testing company Renaud Air, which also sells filters. He estimates about half of all expats have at least one air filter in their homes.※A lot of the local people who＊ve never had an opportunity to live abroad don＊t know any better,§ Brar says. ※They think going to the doctor and getting sick three times a year is normal; it＊s not normal.§Although many in Hong Kong may not be aware of the hazards of dirty air, the government has over a decade of data illustrating the problem 每 but it has been slow to act.※A lot of the bureaucrats don＊t want to be blamed for something,§ Brar says. ※They just try to keep ignoring it and ignoring it as long as possible 每 and saving money, saving money until they have to do something.※Hong Kong is a very pro-business environment,§ he adds. ※The government does know the air quality is really bad 每 but they try to hide the problem.§In a town obsessed with money, the fact that air pollution is estimated to have caused HK$20.bn (?2.2bn) worth of  in 2016 may change more minds.Brar points to a system where buildings in Hong Kong can apply for  每 but the process only tests for PM10, particulate matter akin to dust or pollen, entirely ignoring the smaller, more harmful PM2.5.He says companies that sell air purifiers frequently meet resistance from schools and business, with executives either in denial or unwilling to spend the money required to provide clean air.When Giraudon wanted to present a professional report at his daughter＊s school, Brar offered to test the air quality for free, but was also rebuffed by school officials. Other schools have been more receptive 每 particularly international schools that have more money compared to government-run institutions.Giraudon, however, has left behind his battle for classroom purifiers in favour of a suburb of Annecy, a small French city that has the reputation of having the cleanest lake in Europe.Having arrived last December, Giraudon reports that his daughter Margaux already seems to be doing better. Frequently sick in Hong Kong, she has yet to fall ill, is coughing less and no longer needs to carry an inhaler.After eight years of living in Hong Kong, Giraudon admits he misses the excitement, opportunities and low taxes, which max out at 15% rather than France＊s 45%.※But I prefer to pay tax than to kill my children,§ he says.

"he sombre northern flank of  has three Black Cloughs, differentiated with admirable directness as Near, Middle and Far. Clough is a northern word, likely Old Norse in origin, for a cleft in a hill.The overall effect is familiar enough 每 bleak, desolate, country. But look more closely and the contrasts are spectacular. Far Black Clough has a vehicle track bulldozed up it so  can get to the moors more easily. The stream＊s steep banks, not long burned to boost grouse numbers, are still quite black and eerily quiet. But the bottom of Near Black Clough is much more promising 每 thick with birch and rich with the song of  and , a vibrant reminder of how the other valleys that groove and score these .On this day, when I reached wilder country, at the head of the clough, where the trees thinned out, I heard the call of a  drift across the heather. Insistent, piping, with that fretful, anxious shading that suits the bird＊s skittish nature as well as its desolate home. Moving among the peat hags, one goldie after another appeared ahead of me, poised in silhouette on the apex of the next black mound, full-bodied, almost stout, before it spun away, transformed on narrow wings, so sleek in its angled flight, quick and nimble, so purposeful compared to that other upland plover, the lapwing, with its joyous loops and sudden twists.Most of my sightings of golden plover, or , have been large flocks in winter, so encountering these birds in their breeding plumage was a glorious opportunity. I dug through my rucksack for binoculars, but came up empty handed. Damn. When I walked on, the plovers＊ plaintive call seemed just a little sadder, as though they were commiserating. Then I spotted a couple of walkers at Bleaklow Head, and wandered over, more in hope than expectation, but, sure enough, they were better prepared than me. They kindly passed over their ※bins§, and the nearest plover popped into view, the glittering, butter-gold speckles of its back bordered by the white question-mark that curls above its eye, a shy jewel of the moors revealed."																																																			
"Three days after Donald Trump , senior members of his administration could not present a united front in response to questions about the president＊s beliefs on climate change.Trump has  called climate change a hoax,  that it was ※created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive§.UN ambassador Nikki Haley said in interviews broadcast Sunday that Trump ※believes the climate is changing§, partly because of pollution. But Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), passed up five chances to say whether Trump subscribed to such mainstream scientific belief.Asked by  if saying the Chinese invented climate change to achieve an economic advantage was ※a big box of crazy§, Haley said: ※President Trump believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of that equation. So that is the fact. That is where we are. That＊s where it stands. ※He knows that it＊s changing and the US has to be responsible for it and that＊s what we＊re going to do. Just because we got out of a club doesn＊t mean we don＊t care about it.§On CBS＊s Face the Nation, Haley added that Trump was ※absolutely intent on making sure that we have clean air, clean water, that he makes sure that we＊re doing everything we can to keep America＊s moral compass in the world when it comes to the environment§.On ABC＊s This Week, however, Pruitt responded to host George Stephanopoulos＊s first question on the subject by saying: ※I think the president made it clear that the climate changes. And I think what needs to be emphasised here with respect to the Paris accord was about the efficacy of the agreement as it relates to the environment, how it impacts the economy.※The president said on Thursday that engagement internationally is something that＊s going to continue but what Paris represents is a bad deal for this country and as such is something we need to exit.§Pruitt was asked if it mattered whether the president said climate change was a hoax. He said: ※With respect to the Paris accord, the focus is on the efficacy, the merits of the deal and the demerits of the deal. The president indicated very clearly that engagement by this country internationally is going to continue.§Pruitt also heralded US efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, saying: ※We＊re leading by example ＃ we are leading with action, not words.§ The former Oklahoma attorney general, who regularly sued the EPA in that role, has said , a position rejected by the vast majority of climate scientists.Stephanopoulos asked Pruitt a third time why the president couldn＊t say openly whether he believed in manmade contributions to climate change.※Well, frankly, I think the whole question is an effort to get it off the point and the issue of whether Paris is good for this country or not,§ said Pruitt. ※And the president has indicated the climate changes.§Asked a fourth time, Pruitt said: ※What matters is what you do about it. What matters is what steps you take to address CO2 reductions. And what matters when you look at Paris is that China and India didn＊t take any steps, while this country did. The environmental left has a very short memory. When Paris was executed they criticised it, said it did not hold China and India accountable.§Stephanopoulos tried a fifth and final pass: ※Do you know if President Trump still believes climate change is a hoax?§※Our discussion has been about the efficacy of the agreement,§ Pruitt said. ※That＊s what we spent the last several weeks focused upon. He put America first. He said he could put jobs and the environment first, by the way.§The Paris accord, agreed in 2015 and signed in 2016 under the Obama administration, sets voluntary targets for the reduction of emissions which cause climate change. The US will join only Syria and Nicaragua 每 the former racked by civil war, the latter believing the terms of the deal not strict enough 每 on the sidelines.The former vice-president and environmental campaigner Al Gore appeared across the political talk shows on Sunday. On CNN, he called the decision to pull out of the Paris deal ※reckless§ and ※indefensible§. ※It undermines America＊s standing in the world,§ Gore said. ※It threatens the ability of humanity to solve the climate crisis in time.§Gore met Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, , to discuss the president-elect＊s campaign-trail threats to leave the Paris deal.Saying he had spoken to the president＊s daughter a number of times since then, Gore added: ※I thought that he would come to his senses on it, but he didn＊t.§"																																																			
"The biggest reintroduction of water voles in the UK began this week, with 325 voles released into Kielder Forest in Northumberland, and 350 more to follow later in the summer.Water voles hold a special place in Britain＊s natural history, providing the model for Ratty, the much-loved character in . But the  over several decades, driven by loss of habitat, the pollution of waterways, increased urbanisation, and rampant populations of American mink, originally farmed for their fur but which escaped into the wild and proved a voracious predator on the native vole.More than 90% of the water vole population across the UK has died out, making it the country＊s .Kielder Forest, more than 650 sq km in extent, was once a stronghold of the water vole, but none have been seen there in more than two decades, owing to the prevalence of mink.By a curious quirk of conservation, ※Ratty§ owes the reintroduction in the area to the revival of another water vole predator: the otter. Burgeoning otter populations in Kielder, generations of which have been carefully nurtured through conservation efforts, have displaced the rival mink, which tends not to share hunting grounds with otters.The reintroduction in Kielder Water and Forest Park has only taken place following comprehensive surveys for mink carried out since 2013. The Kielder Water Vole Partnership said it was confident the mink had permanently gone, making the habitat safe. As well as the otter, other native predators such as foxes, stoats, weasels and owls can all be found at Kielder, but these predations are likely to be kept in natural balance as the voles increase their range., reeds, sedges and other food abundant in the area, and the habitat is well suited for them to re-establish themselves along the existing waterways. The Forestry Commission has also helped by adapting its practices to allow wildlife to flourish, for instance by leaving open areas by the waterside where trees have been felled.The prospects for the reintroduced water vole look good: a separate  in the Yorkshire Dales last August has resulted in the mammals spreading as much as a kilometre from the original site, and showing up on the lake for the first time in 50 years. A further 100 were released there at Easter by the National Trust.Eventually, it is hoped the animals will spread across the north Tyne catchment dominated by Kielder Forest, and into western Northumberland.The Restoring Ratty project was funded with a grant of ?421,000 over five years from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and is run by the Northumberland  Trust, the Forestry Commission and Tyne Rivers Trust.This week＊s release was made up of animals taken from Scotland, which boasts healthier numbers of remaining water voles, and in August litters from voles captured in the North Pennines last summer will be released, having spent the winter at a conservation site.Kelly Hollings, of the Northumberland Wildlife Trust, said: ※Water voles belong here and are an essential element of our wild and watery places. It＊s terribly sad to have witnessed such huge declines of this lovely mammal in my lifetime. We＊re doing everything we can to help bring them back.§"																																																			
"Britain has been sent a final warning to comply with EU air pollution limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or face a case at the European court of justice.If the UK does not show Brussels how it intends to comply with EU law within two months, a court hearing with the power to impose heavy fines could begin later this year, .Seb Dance MEP, the Labour party＊s environmental lead in the European parliament, told the Guardian: ※Thousands of lives are lost each year yet the British government simply sits on its hands and does nothing. If the threat of hefty fines and legal action is not enough, then what on earth will compel the government to act when we leave the EU?§The Liberal MEP and environment committee member Catherine Bearder, said: ※Lesser mortals have to face the long arm of the law, why shouldn＊t the government? We know that  has been busting the regulations for years and that means there are people dead who shouldn＊t be. Real lives are being damaged here, because the government won＊t implement the law that its ministers willingly signed up to.§About 50,000 Britons die prematurely each year from respiratory, cardiovascular and other illnesses associated with pollutants such as NO2, particulate matter (PM) and ozone.The public health costs have been , with 6m working days lost each year as a result of the externalised costs of polluting emissions.London, Glasgow, Birmingham and Leeds are among the 16 zones where air quality thresholds were found by the EU to have been repeatedly breached.Keith Taylor, the green MEP for the south-east region, where studies attribute , described the final warning as ※a shameful indictment of the Conservatives＊ irresponsible and deadly apathy.§※The failure highlighted by the  is as much moral as it is legal,§ he added. ※Ministers have displayed an extremely concerning attitude of indifference towards their duty to safeguard the health of British citizens.§Outdoor air pollution is mostly caused by emissions from vehicles and factories, and could be dramatically curbed by reducing traffic, switching to electric cars, and using cleaner power, in line with commitments under the Paris climate agreement.Four other EU states 每 Germany, Italy, France and Spain 每 were served with final warnings on Wednesday. In all, air pollution limits are being flouted in 23 out of the EU＊s 28 countries and 130 of its cities.The UK has been  to laws aimed at curbing air pollution deaths, and in violation of the EU＊s NO2 limit . Parts of London overshot the annual air pollution limit for the whole of 2017 in .A referral to the European court is not inevitable and penalties may depend on mitigating factors, such as steps being taken to align with EU law.But if the UK does not satisfy the European commission that it is acting to reduce its emissions, it could face a lump sum fine, a penalty payment, daily five-figure fines, or a combination of these.Officials say the UK will be bound by the judgements of the European court in Luxembourg for as long as it remains a member of the EU.James Thornton, the CEO of the green law group ClientEarth, said: ※With this final warning from the commission, the government is under pressure from all sides to stop dithering and act decisively to meet its moral and legal obligations to clean up our unhealthy air.§ClientEarth  against the government last November forcing ministers to produce draft plans by 24 April to clean up the UK＊s choking urban streets and lanes as soon as possible.That plan may now be the UK＊s best last chance of avoiding a scramble to the EU＊s exit under fire. Bearder said that any government attempts to use Brexit as an excuse for inaction would be ※a cop out§ after  to transpose EU environmental legislation into UK law before it leaves the bloc.Bearder told the Guardian: ※The government may say we are not bound by the European courts anymore, and therefore we don＊t need to do anything. But people are dying daily and the government has a duty to look after its citizens. In or out, we still need clean air.§A government spokesperson said that the government was committed to improving national air quality and had committed more than ?2bn to increasing the uptake of ultra-low emitting vehicles since 2011, as well as supporting green transport schemes and a new programme of clean air zones.※In the Autumn Statement, we announced a further ?290m to support electric vehicles, low emission buses and taxis, and alternative fuels,§ the official said. ※We will update our air quality plans in the spring to further improve the nation＊s air quality.§Much will hinge on whether the plans do enough to meet the UK＊s obligations under EU law.Enrico Brivio, a spokesman for the environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella, described today＊s moves from Brussels as ※a  asking [them] to comply, to take measures to fight this poor air quality that provokes respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease. It is an important factor on the health of citizens.※We ask the UK, as the other four member states, to take appropriate measures to fight this type of air pollution and we hope they comply.§The Conservative MEP Julie Girling, said: ※The fact that five major European member states have been taken to task shows that this is not only a challenge for British central and local government. Air pollution is a problem that we face across the western world, and its consequences for public health and for NHS budgets are significant.§"																																																			
"Even through Beijing＊s nicotine-tinged smog you can make out the multi-coloured frames, gliding through the pea soup towards a greener future.In recent months an unmissable fleet of fluorescent orange, canary yellow and ocean blue bicycles has hit the streets of urban  as part of a hi-tech bike-sharing boom that entrepreneurs hope will make them rich while simultaneously transforming the country＊s traffic-clogged cities.※We want to solve problems by getting bikes back on to the streets of our cities,§ said Li Zekun, the 25-year-old marketing director of Ofo, one of the startups spearheading this 21st-century transport revolution.From Shanghai to Sichuan province, bike-sharing schemes are being rolled out on an unprecedented scale in an effort to slash congestion and air pollution by putting a country once known as the  back on two wheels.Ofo, so named because of the word＊s resemblance to a bicycle, has put about 250,000 of its bright yellow bikes to work since late 2015, of which around 40,000-50,000 are in the capital, according to Li. The Peking University biology graduate said his company, which was founded by five students looking to improve transport options on university campuses, had attracted about 3 million users in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen and Guangzhou. Its bicycles make about 1.5m trips each day between them.※For short journeys, bikes are the best form of transport,§ Li enthused at Ofo＊s headquarters in the Internet Finance Centre, a 26-floor building in western Beijing. ※You never know when a bus might come. It might not be easy to find a taxi. Walking might take you too long and tire you out.§Other startups, such as  and , are seeking to get in on the act, depositing truckloads of bicycles on sidewalks and street corners across China. Li Gang, Bluegogo＊s 28-year-old chief executive, said he believed bike sharing would bring ※mental joy§ to millions of Chinese citizens as well as boosting their health and fitness levels. It was his mission ※to enable everyone to enjoy the happiness of bike riding§, he said. ※I predict that by next year millions of people will be riding bikes in Beijing every day,§ said the entrepreneur, whose firm has 50,000 bikes spread across three cities 每 Chengdu, Guangzhou and Shenzhen 每 and plans to expand to a new city every fortnight. ※More people will choose this healthy way to get around so the number of cars on the roads will decrease dramatically and this will really help the climate and the environment,§ he said. In the years following Mao Zedong＊s 1949 communist takeover, bikes ruled supreme in China and  每 the eastern equivalent of the  每 became one of the country＊s most recognisable symbols. But two-wheeled travel began to go out of fashion as China became more open to the world, ushering in decades of economic boom and a high demand for cars. In 1980, almost 63% of commuters cycled to work, , citing government data. But by 2000 that number had plummeted to 38% and today it stands at less than 12%.Car use, meanwhile, has rocketed. In 2010  to become the world＊s largest car market, with 13.5m vehicles sold in just 12 months. This year, manufacturers expect to sell . That jump from two to four wheels has been music to the ears of international car manufacturers, but it has resulted in  and contributed to  experts blame for hundreds of thousands of premature deaths every year., Beijing has 5.65m registered vehicles which annually pump 500,000 tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere. And with China now waging a high-profile ※war on pollution§, cities hope a return to the era of the bicycle can help them clean up at least some of the smog. Transport officials in Beijing are aiming to get 18% of commuters riding to work by 2020. Public bike-sharing schemes, of which there are  around the world,  but the scale on which these private initiatives are being rolled out is unprecedented. Reports in the Chinese media suggest hundreds of thousands of shared bikes have been put into action. That compares with 11,500 operating in the British capital, according to Transport for London.The other factor making China＊s bike-sharing boom stand out is the technology.While those sharing bikes in cities such as London must pick them up and park them at docking stations, tracking technology means Chinese users can collect and park their bikes wherever they please. Mobike＊s orange-wheeled bikes have a GPS system that allows users to locate them using a map on the company＊s smartphone app. Users of Ofo＊s yellow bikes, which cost about 10p to use, unlock them using a combination code sent through its app, and the company keeps tabs on its bikes by monitoring the location of the users＊ smartphones. ※It is very convenient,§ said Li, who claims an Ofo bike can be ready to ride in about 10 seconds. Chinese investors, including the tech giants Didi Chuxing and Tencent, are throwing their weight behind the bike-sharing startups,  since the autumn.  about the budding industry in the China Daily warned of ※grave maintenance and management challenges§ and the existence of unscrupulous users who damaged or disappeared with the bikes. Recent weeks have seen reports of stolen bicycles, which are worth up to 3,000 yuan (?350), . But the China Daily urged commuters and city officials to embrace the attempt to ※reinvigorate the nation＊s love affair with the bike§. Li said his company believed so strongly in a global cycling renaissance that it planned to export its bike-sharing revolution to London, Singapore and Los Angeles.※In the future, we hope people all over the world will be using Ofo＊s app to unlock its bikes, anywhere and at anytime,§ he said.

"Medical waste, broken bottles and household trash are some of the items found in more than 100 tonnes of garbage salvaged near a drinking water reservoir in Shanghai.The suspected culprits are two ships that have been  in the Yangtze river. It has then flowed downstream to the reservoir on Shanghai＊s which is also home to 700,000 people. The reservoir at the mouth of the river is one of the four main sources of drinking water for the country＊s largest city, according to local media.  has struggled with air, soil and water pollution for years during its economic boom, with officials often protecting industry and silencing citizens that complain. China＊s cities are often blanketed in toxic smog, while earlier this year more than 80% of water wells used by farms, factories and rural households was found to be  because of pollution.Officials dispatched more than 40 workers to clean up the mess, but the area around the reservoir will take about two weeks to clear, the Shanghai Daily reported. Shanghai＊s water authority claims supplies are still safe to drink, but has stopped the flow coming in while it continues testing, the paper said.Videos circulating on social media showed beaches and wetlands covered in a rainbow of plastic bags. ※There＊s enough trash to cover several football fields,§ a local resident can be heard saying in one video. Catheter bags and used IV sacks are pulled from the water, and in some places only a sea of trash can be seen, completely obscuring the river water.※This is so sad, just humanity digging its own grave,§ one commenter on Twitter-like Sina Weibo said.Needles and medical tubes were found in the trash, which has been washing ashore since 5 November. Despite cleanup efforts, a new wave of garbage inundated the island again this week.Earlier this year more than 500 students developed nosebleeds, rashes and illnesses, some as , in what local media linked to illegal toxic dumping by chemical factories.Although parents complained for months, local officials ignored their claims and disputed any connection despite levels of chlorobenzene, a  that causes damage to the liver, kidney and nervous system, nearly 100,000 times above the safe limit.The country＊s air pollution has been shown to contribute to more than 1 million deaths a year, linked to about a third of deaths in China＊s major cities.

"Tens of thousands of ※smog refugees§ have reportedly fled China＊s pollution-stricken north after the country was hit by its latest ※airpocalyse§ forcing almost half a billion people to live under a blanket of toxic fumes. Huge swaths of north and central China have been living under a pollution  since last Friday when a dangerous cocktail of pollutants transformed the skies into a yellow and charcoal-tinted haze.  the calamity had affected a population equivalent to those of the United States, Canada and Mexico combined with some 460m people having to breathe either hazardous pollution or heavy levels of smog in recent days.A picture from Henan province, showing more than 400 students sitting an exam on a football pitch after their school was forced to close, was widely circulated on social media:Lauri Myllyvirta, a Beijing-based Greenpeace activist who has been , said that in an attempt to shield his lungs he was avoiding going outside and using two air purifiers and an industrial grade dust mask ※that makes me look like Darth Vader§. ※You just try to insulate yourself from the air as much as possible,§ said Myllyvirta, a coal and air pollution expert.Others have simply opted to flee. According to reports in the Chinese media, flights to some pollution-free regions have been packed as a result of the smog. Ctrip, China＊s leading online travel agent, said it expected  this month in a bid to outrun the smog. Top destinations include Australia, Indonesia, Japan and the Maldives. Jiang Aoshuang, one of Beijing＊s ※smog refugees§,  she had skipped town with her husband and 10-year-old son in order to spare their lungs. Jiang＊s family made for Chongli, a smog-free ski resort about three hours north-west of the capital, only to find it packed with other fugitives seeking sanctuary from the pollution. ※It really felt like a refugee camp,§ she was quoted as saying. Yang Xinglin, who also fled to Chongli, said she had requested time off from her job at a state-owned real estate firm so she did not have to inhale the smog. ※You ask me why I left Beijing? It＊s because I want to live,§ Yang, 27, told the Guardian. Emma Zhang, a third ※smog refugee§,  she and her young son had swapped their home in the western city of Chengdu, , for a hotel in the temperate south-western province of Yunnan. ※I finally saw the blue sky. It was wonderful!§ she said.Li Dongke, a 27-year-old Beijinger, said her entire family had decamped to Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, or the tropical island of Hainan in the South  Sea. ※It＊s terrible,§ she complained of the current pollution crisis.Fleeing the danger zone has not been completely straightforward for China＊s environmental exiles. The  that smog had paralysed airports in Beijing and across the country＊s northern industrial heartland in cities such as Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, making escape impossible. Beijing＊s domestic Nanyuan airport cancelled all flights on Tuesday while the Beijing Capital international airport cancelled at least 273 flights. Myllyvirta, the Greenpeace activist, said his group had been warning of a winter smog crisis since July when it began noticing the government was pumping economic stimulus into heavily-polluting industries such as cement and steel.※A big part of what happened is that the steel price went up when the government started a huge wave of construction projects to stimulate the economy,§ he said. One consequence was that a large number of smaller, poorly-regulated steel producers had ※gone on a tear§ leading to increased emissions that were now blackening the skies over northern China. Myllyvirta said he was convinced the future looked brighter for China＊s environment, despite its latest airpocalypse. A fall in the use of coal and air pollution were likely over the next three to five years as more urgent steps were taken to restructure the economy and preserve the environment. For now, however, some locals saw temporary or permanent exile as their only option while many outsiders refused to come at all. ※People are definitely thinking about how to get out and ＃ companies are complaining that it is hard to recruit talent [to come to China],§ Myllyvirta said. ※People don＊t want to live in places with terribly polluted air.§"																																																			
"World leaders should redouble efforts to cut soot emissions because it is the cheapest and fastest way to combat climate change, climate scientists and advocates have told the Guardian.Deposits of soot 每 unburned carbon particles 每 have stained parts of the Arctic black, changing the ice from a reflector of sunlight to an absorber of heat, and accelerating the melting of ice and snow, which itself is .Some scientists believe reducing the concentration of soot particles and other so-called ※short-lived climate pollutants§ entering the atmosphere may be easier in the short term than bringing down carbon dioxide emissions. Such a ※quick win§ would be important to provide breathing space while world populations reduce their use of fossil fuels, scientists say.Paul Bledsoe, a former White House adviser who has worked on climate science issues for a decade, said: ※Limiting short-lived climate pollutants is the cheapest, fastest way to prevent ice melt globally, particularly in the .§Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: ※You can＊t solve a fast-moving problem like Arctic warming without fast-moving solutions. Cutting the short lived-climate pollutants is the fastest solution we＊ve got.※Cutting these super climate pollutants can cut Arctic warming by two-thirds in the near term.§The vast expanse of ice and snow covering the Arctic may look startlingly white from a distance, but on closer examination the glaciers and snow cover are patched by dark streaks of inky black and dusty grey and brown. Some are small and self-contained; others are miles long. All are the mark of man.Hailong Wang, an atmospheric scientist at the US Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, said that both observational and modelling evidence showed that soot was warming the Arctic. ※The warming effect could be through the direct heating to the air, snow and sea ice by absorbing sunlight, and then accelerating the melting of snow and sea ice,§ Wang said. ※When the melting starts, there are positive feedback processes that can lead to even faster melting.§Work by Piers Forster, a professor of physical climate change at the University of Leeds, and Maria Sands, a researcher at Norway＊s Cicero institute, and their colleagues, has established that reducing soot emissions could lower Arctic temperatures by 0.2C within a few decades 每 a valuable contribution, considering that the commitment made in the Paris agreement was to hold temperature rises to no more than 1.5C or 2C. The Arctic bears what could be considered more than its fair share of the world＊s pollution. Industry and tourism in the region are tiny, though mining and oil companies continue to eye-up potential sites as the permafrost retreats. The dirt that scars the Arctic landscape is not local: rather, ocean and air currents carry substances 每 soot, heavy metals, plastic particles, and more 每 fromacross the globe to deposit them in this pristine environment. Chemical pollution has even been found to cause brain damage in polar bears.Soot in the atmosphere has been calculated to be capable of causing warming of about 0.5C in the Arctic, from heating of the atmosphere and melting of snow. This amounts to about a quarter of the observed warming since pre-industrial times. However, the picture is more complicated than these raw figures might suggest. Unburned carbon particles and gases, such as sulphur dioxide, which often accompany soot production, can have an aerosol cooling effect, because in the atmosphere they can deflect heat from the sun back into space. This process, sometimes called global dimming, makes it hard to estimate the final effects of the pollution.While mercury, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl) and other pollutants persist for decades, soot is a less permanent problem. ※Unlike greenhouse gases, soot particles are relatively short-lived in the atmosphere. The average lifetime is around a week or two,§ says Wang. ※New snowfall [can also] cover them [the soot particles] pretty quickly.§And this, according to Zaelke, is what makes soot so important. ※Speed is the key metric here, that we haven＊t paid enough attention to [in discussions over climate change],§ he said. ※We have been looking at slow-moving solutions [such as reducing greenhouse gases] and we need to catch up. We need to do something about near-term warming if we are going to stabilise the climate.§Greenhouse gases are produced by a wide range of human industries: generating electricity, driving, flying, raising cattle, making cement, agricultural fertilisers, and many more. Soot comes from a smaller subset of these activities. Coal-fired power stations are a leading source, as are dirty vehicle engines, and industrial chimneys, but even in developing countries where people have little access to electricity and powered transport, soot is produced by indoor fires used for cooking and heating.Global warming is not the only impact. Soot is behind human health problems from Beijing to Burundi, as the particles are breathed into lungs where they remain, causing and exacerbating respiratory diseases. Smoky fuels kill more than 4 million people a year,  每 a disproportionate number of them women and children, from dirty cooking fires.Dealing with soot, therefore, is not only a win for the climate, but for people＊s health. Forster and Sand have identified three measures as potentially the most effective: reducing the domestic burning of wood in Asia, cutting the flaring of gas in Russia, and reducing emissions from diesel vehicles globally.The technology to do all of these is available. Gas flaring is not only unnecessary but inefficient, as captured waste gases can be used for fuel. Scrubbers can also be fitted to the chimneys of fossil fuel power stations. Car engines can be fitted with filters, as they are in many developed countries, to remove the dirt from exhausts. Cooking fires are individually harder to reach, but in many areas of the world simple solar cookers could be used that would not only reduce deaths from pollution but ease the lives of women and girls for whom the drudgery of finding fuel each day can be physically demanding, and put a brake on education and development.History shows that while these measures can involve some upfront costs, these are quickly repaid in quality of life. Londoners, for example, took pea-soupers as a fact of life before clean air legislation was passed following the deadly smogs of the early 1950s. With the right regulation and political will, soot could be made a historical curiosity across the globe.Forster said: ※The measures [to reduce soot] would also help by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. They would also kick in faster 每 within 10 years of the emissions reduction 每 whereas CO2 emissions reductions just slow the rate of warming. You need negative [CO2] emissions for a CO2 cooling effect.§Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: ※With scientists recognising that soot ranks second only behind carbon dioxide in terms of global warming, it＊s crucial that this pollution is cut to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Tackling soot would be a win-win, because it will bring enormous health benefits by cutting air pollution too. Governments must act now, and act fast.§These actions will only be effective as part of a broader push to tackle carbon emissions. Although dealing with soot could be an important way of heading off one of the threats to the Arctic and the world, it cannot be a substitute for acting on warming gases more widely. ※Greenhouse gases are still the major player in causing the overall melting of the Arctic,§ said Wang. Stopping soot pollution could give us a vital breathing space, but an effective end to global warming 每 and Arctic melting 每 will require much more."																																																			
																																																			
"utdoor air pollution has grown by 8% around the world in the last five years, . Some of the world＊s biggest cities have significantly high pollution levels.Take New York, for example. A recent looked at the health of 300,000 residents and concluded that individuals living in zipcodes with higher concentrations of pollution 每 as measured by the Environmental Protection Agency 每 had a 24% higher chance of having artery constriction.Now, a New York City-based designer thinks he might have the solution. To the awareness problem, at least. Nikolas Gregory Bentel recently released a new line of long-sleeved shirts called , which change colors according to pollution levels in the air. The shirts are priced starting at $500.※Aerochromics is a statement on the rapid deterioration of the our world＊s air quality,§ Bentel says. ※Air quality is only one small part of the larger spectrum of the pollution that we are slowly seeing taking hold of our planet.§The shirts are available in three black-and-white designs, and took Bentel one year to develop. The shirts track different pollutants 每 carbon monoxide, particulate pollution and radiation 每 and work similarly to a household carbon monoxide detector. Chemical salts turn carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, and that oxidation process transforms the color of the shirts. If carbon monoxide levels fall and oxygen levels increase, the colors change again.While  can tell you pollution levels, Bentel argues that rather than turning to phones, tablets and computers that have to be carried around, apparel can do more than just be a fashion statement. ※The shirt forces the user to be aware of pollution levels constantly,§ he says. ※I wanted to apply this tech to an object that was already being used without hesitation every day and was visible from any direction.§To test particle pollution 每 one of the biggest concerns for cities with low air quality 每 Bentel＊s shirts use two sensors placed in the front and the back. A micro-controller in the shirts＊ collar activates heat pads, changing the shirts＊ colors from black to spotted. , anything above 51 on the Air Quality Index (AQI) is a ※moderate§ health concern. Aerochromics shirts go into effect at 60, slowly shifting to the black-and-white pattern. But as the AQI escalates, reaching 160, or ※unhealthy§, the shirts＊ complete pattern becomes apparent.A different version of the Aerochromics shirt changes permanently when exposed to radiation. Exposure of gamma or electron beam radiation causes dyes in the shirt to change color. Once the shirt is exposed to significant amounts of radiation, it remains in that color and pattern. Funded personally through income from his design studio in Queens, Aerochromics is not Bentel＊s first venture. He also created , a ring that gets its oxidized finish by going through a person＊s digestive system;, a program that floods the market with fake social media accounts to dilute data resale values; and , a fake real estate company that claims to help buyers find real estate that would retain value post the impact of climate change.Considering this background in art meets activism, it＊s unclear who, exactly, these shirts are targeting. Bentel says he has a ※stream of customers§, but refused to provide any more information, or access to them. However, he promises the cost of the shirts will fall in the future, making them more reasonably priced. ※This was my first product run for the shirts so I wanted to be sure there was a demand before bringing down the cost,§ he says.Bentel also says a number of academic institutions and commercial companies have also reached out to him about the shirts, but withheld names. ※I am not too interested in selling a lot of the clothing,§ Bentel says. ※The online shop is secondary to the concept. I see Aerochromics first as a statement.§So is it business or is it art? ※This seems like a novel type of clothing line that might, because of the novelty, become fashionable,§ says Mark Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.Aerochromics isn＊t the first project to blend environmental concerns with technology and fashion. In 2011, two New York City students designed  that changed color when met with high levels of carbon monoxide. More recently, Kasia Molga, a British artist and designer who suffers from asthma, premiered a new line of wearable technology that responds to air quality. The project, titled, made its debut in Manchester, England＊s industrial hub, as models paraded around the city in the futuristic designs, illustrating how pollution levels change.But, for all the efforts to raise awareness, Aerochromics doesn＊t actually offer any practical solutions. The shirts are made with conventional cotton, not organic cotton, which has been for harsh use of pesticides and insecticides, a type of chemical pollutants.Whether Bentel＊s shirts will change the dialogue on urban pollution remains to be seen. ※It makes people more aware of the pollution around them,§ Jacobson concedes.In particular, he points to the air pollution and carbon monoxide shirts. If these change color when exposed to cigarette smoke, which contains both ingredients, it could be a deterrent to smoking as well. ※It might make smokers more cognizant of the pollution they are inflicting on non-smokers,§ Jacobson says."																																																			
"The government is exploring whether its ban on tiny pieces of plastic in cosmetics should be extended to other household products, to protect fish and other marine life.Ministers promised earlier this year to , but stopped short of pledging to ban them in other products.Now, officials have called for more evidence on the environmental impact of other sources of microbeads, such as washing powder and householder cleaners. Campaigners said any ban should apply to all products washed down the drain.In , the government said microbeads from personal care products account for less than 4.1% of all microplastics entering the ocean, so a ban solely on those would ※have only a small impact.§ ※We are therefore taking this opportunity to ask for evidence on the extent of the environmental impacts of microbeads found in other products, to inform future UK actions to protect the marine environment,§ officials wrote. Although a wider ban is not explicitly mentioned, the document says the evidence will inform ※targeted, proportionate measures§.A coalition of environmental groups 每 the Environmental Investigation Agency, Fauna & Flora International, Greenpeace UK and the Marine Conservation Society 每 welcomed the cosmetics ban but said it needed to be broader.※It must cover all microplastics as marine life doesn＊t distinguish between plastic from a face wash and plastic from a washing detergent, so the microbeads ban must cover all plastics in all household and industrial products that can go down our drains,§ the groups said in a statement.Microbeads  and increase their mortality rates when ingested during their development. It is not yet clear whether they pose a threat to human health through the food chain, but the UK＊s chief medical officer .More than 378,000 people have signed  calling for a ban on microbeads in products, which many retailers and companies are . Nearly three quarters of major cosmetic companies will have ceased to include them in cosmetic products by 2017, well ahead of the ban at the year＊s end.Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, said microbeads were ※incredibly damaging to our sea life§ and urged shoppers to eschew products containing microbeads today, ahead of the ban. ※Whether you＊re shopping for a loved one, or picking up a bargain in the sales, I urge shoppers to check any rinse-off cosmetics they are buying are microbead free,§ she said.Italy and France are in the process of implementing microbead bans in products, and other countries considering a ban include Ireland, South Korea, Taiwan, India and Australia. The a ban, though campaigners have criticised some of its loopholes. ※Theresa May＊s government has stepped up on this issue and now they need to see it through. We can＊t allow microbeads to pour through those loopholes and into our oceans,§ said Elisabeth Whitebread, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace."																																																			
"A draft European parliament inquiry into the  has found the European commission guilty of maladministration for failing to act quickly enough on evidence that defeat devices were being used to game emissions tests.The commission  from its own science body, the Joint Research Centre (JRC), partly out of a desire to ※avoid placing burdens on industry§, according to the draft report seen by the Guardian.Brussels should have alerted EU states to the suspicions of its scientists and requested information on steps being taken to deal with vehicles that emitted more nitrogen oxide () in real-world situations than in tests. But it did not.※Dieselgate would not have happened if our national governments and the  had acted on their legal and administrative responsibilities,§ said Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, the inquiry＊s co-author.※Our investigation points out that unnecessary delays in decision-making, negligence and maladministration have contributed to making this fraud possible,§ he said.The Guardian has learned that Antonio Tajani, the centre-right European People＊s party (EPP)  in 2017, could be personally censured in amendments to the report, due to be debated early next year.Tajani, a former spokesman to Silvio Berlusconi, was the EU＊s industry commissioner between 2009 and 2014. Some believe MEPs could say that during that time he failed to respond to pressure from the EU＊s environment wing to act on the gathering scandal.Bas Eickhout, a Green MEP, said: ※I would find it very strange if the parliament, having concluded that there was maladministration, then allowed one of the responsible commissioners to become its president. If our amendment is passed, it will mean that Tajani＊s candidature is unacceptable.§Other planned amendments will call for a beefed-up, Europe-wide market surveillance authority, and surprise tests of cars already on the road. The measures could be added to legislation due to come before parliament this term.The draft  report was written as a consensus document and recommends an internal EU inquiry to examine why the JRC＊s detection of possible defeat devices in 2012 were not acted upon.It also advocates putting air quality and car emissions under the control of one commissioner 每 instead of being split between two at present 每 and calls for a renewed focus on potential fraud by manufacturers of .The commission will not respond to the parliamentary report until it is formally released next month.

There seems to be a blind trust in the good intentions of car manufacturers, especially when they have production plants in the country concerned. It is even more disturbing that a year after the dieselgate scandal very little has actually changed.§On Tuesday, the EU＊s technical committee on motor vehicles will vote on a commission proposal to extend real-world driving emissions (RDE) legislation to particulates.

"Southern  has been fined a record ?2m for flooding beaches in Kent with raw sewage, leaving them closed to the public for nine days.The Environment Agency called the event ※catastrophic§, while the judge at Maidstone crown court said on Monday that Southern Water＊s repeat offending was ※wholly unacceptable§. The company apologised unreservedly, as it did when  for similar offences.Southern Water＊s wastewater pumping station at Margate suffered a series of failures in late May and early June 2012, which left it unable to cope with heavy rain. As a result raw sewage poured on to beaches, which were left strewn with tampons, condoms and other debris and cost more than ?400,000 to clean up.Due to health concerns, Thanet district council was forced to close beaches for nine consecutive days, including the Queen＊s diamond jubilee bank holiday weekend.

"Novo Nordisk built a research partnership with , the global mayor＊s partnership on climate, t. For example, city bikes and bike lines contribute to improving climate (lower particle pollution, lower CO2) and improved health (exercise). Our , emphasised that cities need more than bike share programmes, cycle paths and sidewalks to promote health. To ensure equity, we need to think about local urban design and regional planning to ensure accessibility to work by public transport, minimise parking and redistribute employment across regions. This requires integrated planning. In cities such as Bogot芍, Addis Ababa, Mumbai and S?o Paulo, 50% of traffic fatalities are among pedestrians, and another 20-30% are among cyclists. If we want to increase physical activity, we need to work on making biking and walking safe for all. The  has created a network of 10 cities in Africa, Latin America and Asia that are actively working on improving safety. Transport can be the cause of poor health through physical inactivity, air quality and noise, but it can also be the cure 每 through active travel and improving air quality. People who are physically active have a 20-35% reduced risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, a 40-45 % reduced risk of Alzheimer＊s and 35-50% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.

The cities participating in the , which we co-lead with NRDC [Natural Resources Defense Council], are often motivated by energy and health benefits alike. Our private sector engagement is largely with the real estate community (building owners and managers, service companies and relevant NGOs). This collaborative approach ensures the programmes and policies are effective in reducing emissions, but are not overly burdensome for those who must comply. We need to find more holistic approaches to place-based healthcare. Two good examples of these new models of care in the UK are Northfield in Stoke-on-Trent where a range of housing options enable people to continue to live at home with supporting preventative services, a community hub, a doctors surgery and a specialist dementia home. Also in the UK is the  in south London. It＊s an integrated health centre, outpatient and diagnostics services and specialist rehabilitation care for elderly patients as well as a private sector extra care housing scheme of 50 flats.

Using evidence from the WHO＊s commission on social determinants of health, Urban HEART encourages policymakers to develop a holistic approach in tackling health equity. Officials in nearly 50 countries have been trained on using Urban HEART. Detroit is the first American city to use Urban HEART. The critical ingredient is educating departments about where and how health needs to involved, usually much earlier and more critically.

"Beijing authorities have declared a five-day pollution ※red alert§, shutting schools, ordering thousands of vehicles off the roads and telling residents to stay indoors, after the Chinese capital was enveloped by a shroud of toxic smog that is expected to linger until Wednesday.The warning 每 the first since  每 was officially implemented at 4.20pm on Friday as a nicotine-tinged haze rolled into the city.※Smog invades Beijing,§ tweeted Xinhua, China＊s official news agency, alongside a timelapse video capturing the arrival of what city officials have controversially decided to classify as a .A second Xinhua tweet showed the skies blackening over the course of Friday as toxic air swept into the northern city of 21 million citizens.

A red alert is the highest level of a four-tier warning system introduced as part of China＊s high-profile .  nurseries and primary schools across Beijing had been told to close until Wednesday when the smog is expected to lift. Road works were suspended; older and ※dirty§ high-emissions vehicles were forbidden from taking to the roads; and heavily polluting industries such as steel plants were ordered to halt or slow their operations. City officials were also reported to have ※penalised§ 388 people for igniting outdoor barbecues and fires.But Dong Liansai, a Beijing-based climate and energy campaigner for environmental group Greenpeace, said coal-fired power stations, not barbecues, were to blame for the unusually severe bout of pollution. ※Coal is the No 1 source,§ said Dong, warning that the smog contained tiny airborne particulates known as PM2.5 which were linked to numerous ※adverse health effects§ including lung cancer, asthma and heart disease. Dong said the declaration of the red alert was a positive step that would help temporarily reduce emissions and pollution levels. ※But this is only a short-term measure. If you want to solve the problem of air pollution then you really need to have a long-term policy,§ the campaigner added. ※And given that coal is the No 1 source we really recommend a nationwide cap on coal consumption ＃ that would help accelerate the transition away from coal.§Dong said the smog was ※a reminder, after a period of improvement over the last few years, that there is still a lot to do in the future§. , Beijing-based environmentalist Ma Jun said China had made ※huge progress§ in tracking the sources of air pollution over the past decade and had also become much more transparent in releasing information about the blight.However, the risk to human health remained severe, with studies suggesting air pollution was causing between 300,000 and 1 million premature deaths a year. ※There isn＊t much research on the relation between air pollution and lung cancer in , and even less with accessible research results,§ Ma said. ※It＊s sensitive.

The , based at King＊s College University, said vulnerable people, such as those with heart or lung problems, should consider limiting activity too.The mayor also announced a doubling of funding for reducing pollution. He plans measures including charges for the dirtiest diesel cars entering central London from 2017, an acceleration and expansion of the Ultra Low Emission Zone, tighter standards for heavy vehicles and a cleanup of buses.But he does not have the legal authority to institute a ban, and has demanded the government take urgent action, including a diesel scrappage scheme.Cities around the world are confronting problems similar to London＊s. Some have been more aggressive than others, but overall, their experience shows that concerted steps to improve air quality do work, and they save lives.Berlin is a notable exception to the story of the diesel disaster gripping much of western . It has cleaned up its own fleet, installing pollution filters on buses and garbage trucks, and imposed tough rules on heavy goods vehicles. A strict emission zone bars older diesel vehicles, and rates of car use, which are already among the lowest in Germany, have dropped even further in recent years. Public transport is efficient and easy to use, with a two-hour pass costing just 2.70 (?2.25).As a result, levels of the tiniest, most dangerous particles, known as ultrafines, fell 70% in just three years, says Axel Friedrich, former head of transport and noise at the federal environmental agency, and an adviser to government and advocacy groups. Next, environmentalists are pushing for a plan, now under court review, to require diesel cars to meet even stricter standards to enter Berlin and other German cities, he says.Krak車w has the worst air in Poland 每 one of Europe＊s . Every winter, heavy smoke wafts out of chimneys and blankets the city as residents burn coal in low-tech stoves to keep their homes warm.After a , the city is now moving forward with a ban on burning coal for home heating, to take effect in September 2019.New York has also targeted heating systems. After an analysis found that 1% of buildings burning the dirtiest kinds of fuel oil were producing more soot than all the city＊s traffic, .The changeover is already credited with saving hundreds of lives each year. It＊s just one piece of New York＊s air quality strategy, which also aims at slashing greenhouse gas emissions 80% from 2005 levels by 2050, says Mark Chambers, director of the mayor＊s Office of Sustainability.※Air quality is one of those things, you have to address it systemically,§ he says. ※You have to really be thoughtful and intentional about looking at all sources for pollution and addressing them with whatever means you can.§Los Angeles, the city where American car culture reached its zenith, has also pushed hard to clean up its air. While it is still among the country＊s worst, the smogs that once tightened Angelenos＊ chests and made their eyes water are a thing of the past. ※We＊ve made incredible progress, we can see the mountains in Los Angeles, when those of us who grew up here never could when we were young,§ says Joe Lyou, president of California＊s Coalition for Clean Air. Back then, in the 1960s and 70s, ※you couldn＊t go outside, you couldn＊t breathe§, on the worst days.The dramatic improvement is the result of the most stringent air quality regulation in America. Inspectors even check the shelves of DIY stores for paints that are banned because the chemicals that drift off them contribute to smog. A statewide crackdown on dirty diesel lorries and a push to expand use of zero-emission vehicles are also a big part of the story.In addition to the decades of regulation that have made American cars 99% cleaner than they were 40 years ago, cities like New York and LA have benefitted from American motorists＊ distaste for diesel, which accounts for only about 2% of cars in the US.Even China, whose atrocious air the World Health Organisation says killed , has begun to confront its crisis. Beijing has used licence plate restrictions to limit the number of cars and set out plans to keep the oldest and most polluting vehicles off roads when air is especially bad. More importantly, the government has harnessed public anger over pollution to plough , becoming the world＊s biggest investor in renewable energy. Officials have even begun cancelling plans for  每 a move with repercussions for the health of those living in Chinese cities, and for the planet., with air that is perhaps even worse, has been less aggressive. Prime minister Narendra Modi＊s government blames the Congress party that preceded him for letting pollution fester. But despite promises to clean up, the official response has been ineffectual.Last month, Delhi＊s 20 million people suffered through the worst smog episode in 17 years, according to the Centre for Science and Environment. Officials temporarily shuttered a coal-fired power plant, halted all construction and demolition work and shut down many diesel power generators.In a sign that Delhi has begun to acknowledge the problem 每 if not to solve it 每 officials also closed 1,800 schools for three days, as . Tehran did the same when officials said a heavy blanket of smog had . In fact, Iran is home to the city that currently , near the border with Afghanistan.So what does it feel like to live in a city where the air doesn＊t make you sick? ※It＊s nice,§ Berlin＊s Friedrich said with a laugh, adding that his neighbourhood in the south-western quarter is one of the cleanest. ※My air quality is like the countryside.§"																																																			
"Barnaby Joyce has declined to say whether Australia should remain within the Paris climate accord if the United States pulls out, in a departure from the  that Australia will stay the course.While Australia＊s energy and employment ministers have said this week Australia will honour its Paris commitments regardless of what  decides, the Nationals leader and deputy prime minister was more guarded on Thursday.Asked what Australia should do if Trump quit the treaty, Joyce told reporters: ※Well, um, to speculate on a whole range of things is dangerous, to speculate on what Donald Trump might do is insanity.§Pressed with a second question, Joyce said: ※I＊m going to watch my Twitter feed and see what happens.§The US president confirmed on Thursday morning Australian time the formal decision of his administration about Paris was imminent.Over this past weekend, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg,  by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, that Australia was in the Paris accord for the long haul.The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, , said the government had made it clear that the US staying the course with the global climate agreement was desirable and in Australia＊s national interest.She said Australia was committed to the Paris agreement and to our carbon emissions reduction target, and she said Australia＊s interests were best served by the US maintaining its commitment to the Paris agreement.Frydenberg said on Wednesday afternoon what Trump did was a matter for him but he noted the emissions intensity of the US economy was at its lowest level in 20 years. ※It is moving in the right direction,§ he said.He said more than 140 countries had ratified the Paris agreement and ※Australia takes our obligations to agreements we sign up to and ratify very seriously.※Australia has commitments and we are sticking to those. I think we can meet our targets and we are making good progress in doing so.§On Thursday, Malcolm Turnbull was asked whether history would repeat itself. Turnbull was asked whether he would follow Trump out of Paris, just as John Howard had followed George W Bush out of the Kyoto treaty.Turnbull said Australia was staying in the agreement. ※I repeat today, what I said on the 16th of November, when the treaty was ratified, when Australia makes a commitment to a global agreement, we follow through and that＊s exactly what we＊re doing.§※We are committed to the Paris agreement, and we＊re on track to meet our targets.§In a television interview later on Thursday, Joyce also indicated Australia would stay the course. ※The whole point of having international agreements is you comply with them,§ the deputy prime minister told Sky News.Joyce said Australia would comply with the Paris agreement in a way that would have a ※minimal impact§ on the job prospects of Australians.But government conservatives have been signalling for months that Australia should review its commitments if Trump quits the treaty.The chairman of the government＊s backbench committee on environment and energy, Craig Kelly, told Guardian Australia on Thursday if the US pulled out, Australia would need to consider its position.※I think we should reconsider where the entire treaty is up to,§ Kelly said.The Sydney Liberal said Australia＊s commitment under the agreement was ※one of the most significant in the world§ and he contrasted that commitment with undertakings from China and Russia, which he characterised as negligible.He said the Paris treaty weakened America economically at the expense of two strategic adversaries, China and Russia. ※Is that a good thing from Australia＊s point of view?§Kelly said if Trump chose to stay within the Paris framework, but scale back the US emissions reduction commitments, then Australia could follow suit.As reports emerged from the US that Trump would likely pull out, Kelly posted on Facebook that he had ※the champagne on ice§.Kelly＊s view will be shared by other conservatives. While he is yet to enter the fray on the Paris deal, Tony Abbott has been campaigning publicly against the renewable energy target he adjusted as prime minister for some months.The assistant minister for social services and multicultural affairs, Zed Seselja, one of the government＊s up-and-coming conservative figures,  Australia was already ※doing more than our share, in my opinion§.The frontbencher said Australia was committed to the Paris treaty as things stood, but if America withdrew, that would change the nature of the agreement. ※Obviously you wouldn＊t want to speculate, but if they were to pull out obviously that would change the nature of that agreement.§Trump＊s likely withdrawal from the Paris deal complicates the politics of energy policy for the Turnbull government, which next week will be handed the Finkel review of the national electricity market.In a speech to an economic thinktank late on Wednesday, Frydenberg referenced the climate wars of the past decade, noting that energy policy had ※destroyed two prime ministers and one opposition leader§.He predicted ※big battles§ both within the  每 and potentially within Labor 每 and externally with stakeholders, as the government seeks to land a new policy post-Finkel.There a  that the chief scientist will use his looming report to recommend the government adopt a new low-emissions target, which would work in practice as a technology-neutral renewable energy target (RET)."																																																			
", the world＊s biggest oil company, was compelled by shareholders to be more open about the impact of climate change on its business in a ※historic§ surprise vote on Wednesday.The public rebuke came as Donald Trump reportedly  of the Paris climate accord, the agreement forged by close to 200 countries to address climate change.Some 62% of shareholders voted for the resolution and against Exxon＊s management at the company＊s annual meeting in Dallas, Texas. The vote to more clearly report how climate change affects Exxon＊s business comes as investors are increasingly demanding companies disclose the likely impact of global warming and follows the passing of similar proposals at two smaller energy companies earlier this month.Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, which led the vote, said shareholders were showing how out of step the Trump administration had become on climate change. ※Trump is acting contrary to Wall Street and the world＊s largest investors,§ he said. ※Climate change is a material financial risk and shareholders want to know how companies will manage the change to a low carbon economy.§Exxon＊s management sought to head off the proposal championed by the pension funds of the Church of England, New York and California and other large shareholders, which will force the company to conduct an annual ※stress test§ measuring how its oil assets will be affected by climate change regulation and new technology.Last year, the same proposal was backed by 38% of shareholders who voted.Addressing the meeting Mason said many of the company＊s board members had made clear that ※they recognised the significance of the agreed international goals on climate change§ in their other roles.Board member Ursula Burns, former CEO of Xerox, signed the Obama administration＊s , and fellow board member Kenneth Frazier chairs Merck, a pharmaceutical company that supports ※national and international action to address the challenges presented by climate change§, said Mason. He pointed out that another board member, Susan Avery, former president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, had : ※Clearly climate science is telling us get off fossil fuels as much as possible.§※Members of the board, do you leave your understanding of climate change at the door when you attend the ExxonMobil board meeting?§ Mason asked.Chief executive Darren Woods said: ※We believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action, thoughtful action. As a company we are taking action in many ways.§But he said the company was doing enough to address the impact of climate change and regulation on its business and that the board was against the proposal. ※The board believes the company has adequately assessed the future impact of policy developments,§ he said.Earlier this month, shareholders overcame management opposition to similar proposals at Occidental Petroleum and PPL, a large utility holding company, and passed resolutions forcing the companies to more clearly explain how climate change could affect their businesses. BlackRock, Exxon＊s largest shareholder, backed the resolution at Occidental＊s shareholders＊ meeting, the first time the investment group had voted against a company＊s management over climate change.※When we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive to our efforts to protect the long-term economic interests of our clients, we will not hesitate to exercise our right to vote,§ BlackRock said a .Sue Reid, vice-president of climate and energy at the sustainable investor network Ceres, called the vote ※historic§.※This is a very strong message from investors that climate change matters and must be addressed. Now we need to see Exxon take action.§New York comptroller Thomas P DiNapoli said: ※This is an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy.  is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil. The burden is now on ExxonMobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.§The ExxonMobil resolution, introduced by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, says that the company ※should analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil＊s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2-degree [C] target§.The resolution adds: ※This reporting should assess the resilience of the company＊s full portfolio of reserves and resources through 2040 and beyond, and address the financial risks associated with such a scenario.§The meeting, the first since former CEO Rex Tillerson left to become secretary of state, was held at the IM Pei-designed Morton H Meyerson symphony center in downtown Dallas."																																																			
"The survival of coral reefs requires a radical rethink of what conservation means, as well as embracing some of the changes they are undergoing, according to a paper by leading coral reef scientists.※Helping coral reefs to safely navigate the Anthropocene is a profound challenge for multiscale governance,§ the scientists say in a  published today in the journal Nature. They argue reef conservation must no longer be seen as an attempt to restore reefs of the past, or conserve their existing values, but rather to identify the parts of reefs that are essential to their continued existence, and protect those. The paper comes amid increased urgency from conservationists and reef managers around the world, sparked by the  in recorded history. It caused mass die-offs in every major coral reef region of the world. On the Great Barrier Reef alone, it is estimated that about half the coral was killed in 2016 and 2017. In the paper, the scientists argue saving the world＊s reefs requires the acceptance that the reefs of the future will look very different to those of today, and humans may need to help them adapt 每 perhaps by intervening to increase the proportion of coral species that are tolerant to rising temperatures.※In the coming centuries, reefs will run the gauntlet of climate change, and rising temperatures will transform them into new configurations, unlike anything observed previously by humans,§ the paper says.But the overall message was one of hope, said lead author of the paper Terry Hughes from James Cook University in Australia. ※There＊s no shortage of people saying reefs  or whatever,§ Hughes said. ※They are going to be different systems with a different mix of species but if we throw the kitchen sink at it and especially deal with climate change then we will have functioning reefs that will sustain and repair themselves and be of some use to people,§ he said.The group of scientists, which includes both biologists and social scientists, argue the approach to reef conservation must change in several ways.As coral reefs change, the authors say scientists and conservationists must focus on aspects of reef ecosystems that are the most important to their continued existence. They say biodiversity is no longer the most important value to protect, since some species are more important to the ecosystem than others. They also suggest that helping reefs adapt may become an important strategy. ※Ecosystem composition change is already occurring naturally, as corals respond and adapt to climate change, and could be promoted further through efforts to actively manipulate ecosystem configurations,§ they write.Besides embracing the fact that reefs will never be the same, they argue research and conservation must shift from the most direct impacts on reefs, and instead identify and target the root causes.For example, rather than focusing just on the role herbivorous fish play in suppressing seaweed, thereby allowing reefs to recover, conservation efforts should focus on what drives the overfishing of those fish 每 such as poverty and market demands. ※We tend to propose bandaids rather than dealing with the root cause of the issue,§ Hughes said.Underlying the finding that reefs will continue to survive is the assumption that agreements made at Paris to keep global warming to ※well below 2C§ are successful.The researchers reviewed published experiments that examined the response of coral to rising temperatures, and found none that looked at the carbon dioxide levels they say reefs are likely to experience over the next century. Instead, those studies universally examined much more extreme scenarios, equivalent to several degrees of global warming.※Most of the coral reef literature assumes business-as-usual emissions to the end of the century, which would result in global warming of 4, 5 or 6C,§ says Hughes. ※We will never get there 每 not because people will become more and more concerned about coral reefs 每 but because Florida will go under water and that will get people＊s attention.§ Similarly, the authors said experiments examining the impacts of acidification looked at exaggerated scenarios, and the researchers said there were some suggestions acidification may not have a large impact on the growth of coral. The understanding that coral reefs will never be the same is already affecting management practices around the world.In Australia, the  that advisers to the government＊s plan to protect the Great Barrier Reef have said it must stop trying to ※improve§ and restore the natural heritage values, and instead should aim to ※maintain the ecological function§ of the reef, while accepting its overall health would inevitably decline.Similarly, sources have told the Guardian that discussions are occurring within Unesco, over how to protect natural heritage values, given that climate change means many heritage sites will inevitably be altered.Not all coral reef biologists are supportive of efforts to manipulate reef ecosystems.Justin Marshall from the University of Queensland said the new paper made many good points, but that he did not think attempts to pick and choose parts of reefs to save would be successful. ※We＊re consistently crap at playing God 每 or playing Darwin,§ Marshall said, adding that ecosystems were too complex to predict the outcomes of particular interventions."																																																			
"The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, says Australia＊s national interest is best served if Donald Trump stays the course with the .With the US president expected to make a decision this week about whether America will pull out of the Paris accord, officials were asked during Senate estimates hearings whether Australia had made diplomatic representations to the Trump administration encouraging the president to remain in the agreement.Cash, who was the minister at Wednesday＊s hearing, said the government had made it clear that the US saying the course with the global climate agreement was desirable and in Australia＊s national interest.She said Australia was committed to the Paris agreement and to our carbon emissions reduction target, and she said Australia＊s interests were best served by the US maintaining its commitment to the Paris agreement.The secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and former foreign policy adviser to Malcolm Turnbull, Frances Adamson, was asked whether Australia had made representations to the Trump administration about the Turnbull government＊s pro-Paris position.Adamson said she could not point to a ※particular discussion§ but she said the Australian government＊s view on the Paris deal was well known to the Trump administration.The ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, said discussions between political leaders were ※confidential§ but he told the hearing he had expressed Australia＊s commitment to the Paris deal in contact with US officials.Adamson said it was in Australia＊s interests that all the current signatories to the deal maintained their commitment.

"After receiving misinformation from the anti-vaccine movement, including its founder Andrew Wakefield, immunization rates plummeted in a community of Somali immigrants in Minnesota, . It＊s a disturbing trend on the rise in America that shows the importance of immunization and the dangerous power of misinformation. published in PLOS One by John Cook, Stephan Lewandowsky, and Ullrich Ecker tests the power of inoculation; not against disease, but against the sort of misinformation that created the conditions leading to Minnesota measles outbreak.  suggests that exposing people to the tricks used to spread misinformation can equip them with the tools to recognize and reject such bogus claims.The study focused specifically on misinformation about climate change. The scientists wanted to determine if inoculation could boost peoples＊ resistance to , and efforts to cast doubt on .The two issues are connected 每 in climate stories, journalists will often present arguments by climate scientists and climate deniers with equal weight, creating the perception of a 50/50 split when in reality, 97% of experts are on one side, as elegantly illustrated by John Oliver in this clip with over 7 million views from his HBO program Last Week Tonight :In one experiment, before showing people a media story with this sort of climate false balance, the study authors first provided a group with information about the 97% expert consensus, and delivered an ※inoculation§ explaining the misleading effects of false balance media coverage.They found that in the group that was only exposed to the false balance story, average perceived consensus, acceptance of human-caused global warming, trust in climate scientists, and support for climate policy all fell. When subjects were first inoculated against false balance and told about the expert consensus, these factors instead all increased. The authors concluded:In a second experiment, they exposed participants to consensus misinformation via , explained in the video below, and again inoculated one group against the misinformationThe inoculation this time consisted of a mixture of text and a figure of a tobacco ad with the text ※20,679 Physicians say ＆Luckies are less irritating＊§ to show participants a similar previous example of the fake experts technique employed in the Oregon Petition. As in the first experiment, exposure to only the misinformation decreased participant perception of the expert consensus, acceptance of human-caused global warming, and support for climate policies. However, exposure to the inoculation offset the effects of the misinformation.I asked lead author John Cook how these findings can be implemented in the real world where misinformation about subjects like climate science and vaccines is pervasive.In short, the more we explain , the more people will become inoculated against them. When we＊re exposed to examples of people using cherrypicking or fake experts or false balance to mislead the public, it becomes easier to recognize those techniques, and we＊re less likely to fall for them in the future. Teaching people to recognize those techniques is a primary goal of  mentioned by Cook.When anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield was confronted with the consequences of misinforming the Somali immigrants in Minnesota, he told a Washington Post reporter ※§ One wonders whether we＊ll be hearing those words from climate deniers in the coming years.Hopefully it won＊t come to that, if we can avoid the worst consequences of human-caused climate change. Inoculating people against the techniques used by climate deniers and misinformers can help us achieve that goal."																																																			
"Four in 10 of Britain＊s local authorities breached legal air quality limits last year, largely due to heavy road traffic, government records reveal.Ministers have admitted that 169 local authorities were found to have gone over annual limits on nitrogen dioxide. It is an invisible gas produced predominantly by road traffic, and is linked to lung disease and cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and strokes.Monitoring stations in councils across all four nations of the UK recorded breaches of the legal limits on NO2, data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs shows.A report in April from the environment, food and rural affairs select committee stated that poor air quality was linked to more than 40,000 premature deaths in the UK every year. The committee is chaired by Neil Parish, the Tory MP who obtained the latest figures from the government.Parish said he was working with the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue to secure the power and funding to introduce a clean air zone in pollution hotspots in all local authorities. This month, the government made available ?3m for councils to bid for funding to improve air quality.Parish said: ※These are shocking statistics. When we think of areas breaking air quality laws, we usually think of a handful of areas in our busiest towns and cities. These figures show just how widespread the problem is across the UK. It requires a comprehensive solution 每 urgently§.※The government needs to act now to give all councils the power 每 and crucially, the funding 每 to implement a clean air zone and limit the most polluting vehicles in hotspot areas. The ?3m government funding pot is a start but not nearly enough. We also need a big push to incentivise electric and low emissions vehicles to replace the oldest, most polluting vehicles.§The government is being hauled before the courts over its failure to tackle the levels of nitrogen dioxide. A 1999 European Union directive set legal limits that came into force in 2010. Now the legal activist group, ClientEarth, is asking the high court to order ministers to come up with a better plan for improving air quality.Sam Hall, environment researcher at Bright Blue, said the  should be banned from cities in order to tackle the problem. ※Forty percent of local authorities in the UK breached legal air pollution limits last year,§ he said. ※Poor air quality is clearly a national public health issue that requires urgent action.※The government＊s current plans for in just five cities do not go far enough. Ministers should enable all city councils to set up clean air zones to restrict the dirtiest cars from urban centres.※Together with measures to encourage greater uptake of electric vehicles, this approach would reduce air pollution, cut carbon emissions and boost automotive manufacturing in the UK.§"																																																			
"The Guardian＊s new global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, recently explained why he believes that there is currently no news story more important than climate change. ※How to put the environment front and centre is the big challenge,§ he wrote, before asking for your ideas for the new, expanded environment team. We＊ve received a notable volume of correspondence on this matter 每 and would like to thank all of you who took the time to write in with your thoughts. We wanted to share a small portion of those responses here, but will also be feeding back all your ideas and points of view to the environment team. If you missed Jonathan＊s piece 每  每 but would still like to contribute on this subject, then there is still time to do so. Send your thoughts by . As ever, we look forward to hearing from you.I＊ve been active in the green movement for around 30 years, and think it＊s fair to say that it has relied heavily on science for the legitimacy of its message. Many environment-related presentations start with a graph, table, or set of numbers. This is no doubt very important, but it has led to a corresponding reliance on science as a medium for communicating the environmental ※message§ and on technology as a means of dealing with our environmental problems. Arguably, there＊s not enough politics and not enough culture. I＊d like to see the Guardian covering the cultural aspects of green politics in more detail 每 novels, plays, the visual arts. What＊s happening there? What＊s its effect?In his article, Jonathan referred to the Anthropocene. That debate is currently dominated by scientists too. Of course the science is vital, but while the geologists are still debating whether we are in the Anthropocene or not, culturally we＊ve been in it for 20 or 30 years. So, a key question the Guardian could consider is not what is the Anthropocene, but what does it mean? How do we think of ourselves and our futures under the sign of the Anthropocene? Does it change who we are?I applaud your decision to step up environment reporting. I note also the commitment to consider the environment in other areas of reporting. A case in point: an article in the magazine the same Saturday as Jonathan Watts＊ piece, , contained one sentence in four pages that dealt with the environmental impact of the growth in white vans. I understand that this was a piece about the people who are driving the many more vans on the road, but could it not have had at least an explainer looking at some of the issues?Some questions might have been: How much of this traffic is driven by internet shopping? Is it better for Ocado and Tesco etc to deliver just once to 30 households, than for 30 people to drive to the supermarket? Or are these extra journeys?I agree with considering environmental issues as a fundamental element in global crisis, and would be very interested in stories that draw attention to the big picture, such as the effect of the expanding global population on environmental threats. But I am as much 每 or more 每 interested in hearing about everyday contributions that individuals can make towards reducing energy use.I would like to see environment coverage include local issues, and ideas for small changes that are easy to make. Enough small changes by enough people, and you reach a tipping point. The result can be enormous environmental improvements.The Guardian should be educating us on the impact of every significant decision we make 每 we ought to be aware of the shape of our climate impact and carbon footprint. But talking even to those committed to the cause, it appears that few have a grasp of information that could really inform their decisions. Impacts can be very complicated, but one of the more simple ones to compute (and sometimes the biggest one to tackle) is travel, especially air miles. Please publish tonnes of carbon per holiday clearly for each option in the Travel supplement. A simple graphic of how it adds to the average Guardian reader＊s footprint would bring it home.I was heartened to read the Guardian＊s announcement about expanding its environment desk. I find it frustrating that climate change is so far down the agenda of most political parties, save the Green party. And while surveys reveal that most people are concerned about this subject, the day-to-day demands of living seem to relegate the subject to a peripheral position. I have friends and acquaintances who take several flights a year for holidays. A focus on the damaging effects of frequent flying should, in my view, be a priority. It would be useful if the Guardian could compile a list of the most damaging behaviours supported by the relevant statistics.People can get depressed about environmental issues, not just because they seem so huge and difficult to tackle, but because it can be hard to understand how to make a real difference. I hope you will report on people and organisations that have made real changes for everyone＊s benefit by getting involved at a level higher than the individual (it＊s about more than cycling to work rather than driving!). If people feel galvanised or even empowered, then things can change for the better. I have spent 40 years campaigning for the environment, often pushing water uphill but with enough ※wins§ to want to carry on. We need more people who want to do that. Can you encourage them?Climate stories often seem to come across in a disjointed way: we start the year with a news piece that the last year was hotter than ever; we get another story that Greenland＊s ice is melting a bit faster than predicted; there＊s mention of methane gas being released in the Arctic circle. I think the inter-connectedness between these stories needs constant reinforcing. Tipping points don＊t just happen when we reach an arbitrary 2C average temperature rise 每 it looks like it＊s happening now and happening faster than we expected.I also want to read the story on what we are doing about it. How much CO2 have we cut in emissions? Who is successfully capturing and storing it? Who has been effective in government to curb the excesses of the carbon conglomerate?The environment is telling us that ignorance, stupidity, fear, hatred, greed, and blind tribalism must be overcome if we are to survive. It is the world calling us to unite, as human beings. The environment is the one thing we all have in common which penetrates deeper than humanity. It is time for us, in every sense of the word, to grow up.Good luck with your new environment desk. Get off page 54 and on to the front page! "																																																			
"Africa＊s  is causing more premature deaths than unsafe water or childhood malnutrition, and could develop into a health and climate crisis reminiscent of those seen in China and India, a study by a global policy forum has found.The first major  both the human and financial cost of the continent＊s pollution suggests dirty air could be killing 712,000 people a year prematurely, compared with approximately 542,000 from unsafe water, 275,000 from malnutrition and 391,000 from unsafe sanitation. While most major environmental hazards have been improving with development gains and industrialisation, outdoor (or ※ambient particulate§) air pollution from traffic, power generation and industries is increasing rapidly, especially in fast-developing countries such as Egypt, South Africa, Ethiopia and Nigeria.※Annual deaths from ambient [outdoor] particulate matter pollution across the African continent increased by 36% from 1990 to 2013. Over the same period, deaths from household air pollution also continued to increase, but only by 18%§, said a researcher at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development development centre. The OECD is funded by the world＊s richest 35 countries.For Africa as a whole, the estimated economic cost of premature air pollution deaths in 2013 was roughly $215bn (?175bn) a year for outdoor air pollution, and $232bn for household, or indoor, air pollution. The study＊s author, Rana Roy, is concerned by the pace at which outdoor air pollution is growing in Africa, bucking the downward trend in most countries. Used cars and trucks imported from rich countries are adding to urban pollution caused by household cooking on open fires.※This mega-trend is set to continue to unfold throughout this century. It suggests that current means of transportation and energy generation in African cities are not sustainable,§ said Roy. ※Alternative models to those imported from industrialised economies, such as dependence on the individual automobile, are necessary. ※It is striking that air pollution costs in Africa are rising in spite of slow industrialisation, and even de-industrialisation in many countries. Should this latter trend successfully be reversed, the air pollution challenge would worsen faster, unless radically new approaches and technologies were put to use.※The ＆new＊ problem of outdoor air pollution is too large to be ignored or deferred to tomorrow＊s agenda. At the same time, Africa cannot afford to ignore the ＆old＊ problem of household pollution or to consider it largely solved: it is only a few high-income countries 每 Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Seychelles and Tunisia 每 that can afford to view the problem of air pollution as being a problem of outdoor particulate pollution alone.§The study stresses that there is not nearly enough knowledge of the sources of air pollution and its impact in much of Africa. It quotes UK scientist , professor of atmospheric chemistry at York University, who is leading a large-scale investigation of air pollution in west Africa.※London and Lagos have entirely different air quality problems. , it＊s mainly due to the burning of hydrocarbons for transport. African pollution isn＊t like that. There is the burning of rubbish, cooking indoors with inefficient fuel stoves, millions of steel diesel electricity generators, cars which have had the catalytic converters removed and petrochemical plants, all pushing pollutants into the air over the cities. Compounds such as sulphur dioxide, benzene and carbon monoxide, that haven＊t been issues in western cities for decades, may be a significant problem in African cities. We simply don＊t know.§Whereas China has reached a level of development that has allowed it to concentrate on solving air pollution, most African countries must grapple with several major environmental burdens at the same time, said the report.※[They] are not in the position of a China, which can today focus on air pollution undistracted by problems such as unsafe water or unsafe sanitation or childhood underweight,§ said Roy.Henri-Bernard Solignac-Lecomte, head of the Europe, Middle east and Africa unit at the OECD development centre, said the paper made a double case for action. ※Air pollution in Africa increasingly hurts people and hinders economic development. Reducing it requires urgent action by governments to change the unsustainable course of urbanisation. Indeed, Africa urbanises at a very fast pace: today＊s 472 million urban dwellers will be around a billion in 2050. Today＊s investment choices will have decade-long impacts on urban infrastructure and the quality of life of urbanites.※Bold action to improve access to electricity, using clean technologies such as solar power, can contribute to reducing the exposure of the poorer families to indoor smog from coal or dung-fired cooking stoves.※As for outdoor pollution, African economies would be well advised to learn from the experience of industrialised countries, for example by developing mass public transportation systems 每 like Rabat or Addis-Ababa are doing with their tramways.§ Roy warned that the human and economic costs of air pollution might ※explode§ without bold policy changes in Africa＊s urbanisation policies.He concluded with a call for urgent international action: ※If Africa＊s local air pollution is contributing to climate change today, at a time when its population stands at 1.2 billion, or 16% of the world＊s population, it is safe to suppose that ＃ it is likely to contribute considerably more when its population increases to around 2.5 billion, or 25% of the world＊s population in 2050, and thence to around 4.4 billion, or 40% of the world＊s population in 2100.§"																																																			
"A leading government conservative has put a question mark over Australia＊s continued participation in the  in the event Donald Trump decides the United States will pull out.The assistant minister for social services and multicultural affairs, Zed Seselja, one of the government＊s up-and-coming conservative figures, told Sky News on Monday that ※as it stands§ the Turnbull government was committed to Paris agreement, but , that would change the nature of the agreement.He added Canberra was currently ※doing more than our share, in my opinion§.Seselja said Australia was committed to the Paris agreement and had put forward targets. ※They are strong measures: 26-28% [in greenhouse gas reductions]. So we are doing more than our share, in my opinion,§ he said Monday.Asked about what would happen if Trump followed through with his campaign threat to pull out, Seselja said: ※When it comes to the US＊s position that is a matter for the new US administration.§The  frontbencher said if America withdrew, that would change the nature of the agreement. ※Obviously you wouldn＊t want to speculate, but if they were to pull out obviously that would change the nature of that agreement.※But as it stands, the Australian government is committed to the Paris agreement.§Trump is believed to be  about whether to stay the course on the Paris agreement or pull out. The president has previously promised to ※cancel§ the deal, but reports suggest his advisers are split over whether quitting the compact would be worth the resulting diplomatic fallout.The president has already  to unravel a number of Barack Obama＊s regulatory measures to combat climate change, including eliminating the clean power plan, which sets limits on the amount of greenhouse gases that power plants emit.Seselja＊s comments on Monday follow  from the chair of the Turnbull government＊s backbench committee on environment and energy, fellow conservative, Craig Kelly.Kelly said Australia would need to review its participation in the Paris agreement on climate change if Trump pulled out.Asked a month ago whether a majority of his Coalition colleagues would be in favour of quitting the Paris deal in the event Trump pulled out, Kelly told Guardian Australia ※it would be a close run thing§.If Trump withdraws, it would embolden conservative MPs to reopen a deeply contentious issue within Coalition ranks.The Turnbull government has been attempting to hold the line on the Paris deal, arguing once Australia makes a commitment to a global deal, it follows through.The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, , on the day the Australian government ratified the Paris accord, that Australia would stay the course.He indicated it would take the US four years to withdraw from the agreement after ratification in the event Washington resolved to quit."																																																			
"The  has been given a D on a report card for its overall health by the federal and Queensland governments for the fifth year in a row.The results of the annual report card were based on data collected before this year＊s  that killed  of the reef＊s coral, suggesting next year＊s results will be even worse.The  measures the progress towards water pollution targets, as well as the overall health of the Great Barrier Reef＊s ecosystems, including coral and seagrass.Combining all the measurements, the reef was rated D or ※poor§.Many of the individual assessments of progress towards water-quality targets showed very slow progress.The government has a target to reduce inorganic nitrogen flowing into the Great Barrier Reef 每 mostly from sugar-cane fertilisation 每 by 50%. The report card rated progress towards that target with an E or ※very poor§, finding it had only been reduced by 18.1%.Progress towards improving sugar-cane farming and grazing practices in Great Barrier Reef catchments was rated ※poor§, as was progress towards sediment and pesticide targets.Some improvement was seen in coral cover in ※inshore reefs§ 每 those closest to the coastline 每 with their score moving from a D to a C.But the coral cover in the most northerly sections 每 Cape York and the Wet Tropics 每 were given a score of D.Those northern sections, particularly Cape York, were the hardest hit by the 2016 bleaching event, which occurred after the data used for this report card was collected.Initial estimates show that 22% of the coral along the whole Great Barrier Reef was killed in the event, with 85% of that mortality occurring in the northern tip, north of Lizard Island.The results  from the Queensland government in August finding $8.2bn was needed to meet water-quality targets the government has committed to, in order to avoid having the reef included on the world heritage in-danger list.The new report card said ※hundreds of millions§ were being spent on projects to reduce pollution.The government will need to report to the UN＊s world-heritage committee in December on implementation of its plan to meet those targets, including on whether the plan has been adequately funded.Imogen Zethoven from the Australian Marine Conservation Society described the report as ※startling§.※Coral bleaching, crown-of-thorn outbreaks and the ongoing poor condition of inshore reefs 每 these are the visible signs of a reef in crisis and the need for urgent action on water quality,§ she said.※The reef can＊t survive and thrive without clean water. We must see accelerated action by the  government to move ahead with legislative caps on water quality, supported by the federal government,§ Zethoven said.Sean Hoobin form WWF Australia said the results were ※not a good look§ ahead of the government＊s reporting to the UN.※The continuing poor scores are further evidence that the current programs and spending on reef pollution fall far short of what＊s required. At this rate Australia simply won＊t meet the targets committed to in Reef 2050,§ he said.Hoobin pointed out that almost $13bn is being spent to save the Murray-Darling basin.※The reef is the jewel in the crown of Australia＊s tourism industry and deserves a rescue package similar to the Murray-Darling basin,§ Hoobin said."																																																			
"Australia and  should allow open migration for citizens of Pacific nations threatened by climate change, to boost struggling island economies and prevent a later mass forced migration, a paper from the World Bank argues.The policy paper, , suggests as one climate change adaptation measure, open access migration from Tuvalu and Kiribati 每 for work and permanent settlement 每 to Australia and New Zealand.Tuvalu (population 11,000) and Kiribati (107,000) are low-lying archipelago nations in the Pacific acutely vulnerable to climate change, in particular to rising sea levels that have already begun inundating land and homes across the islands.The World Bank paper argues a structured migration program instituted now would prevent a more harried, forced migration in future generations.※The worsening impacts of climate change have provided a new moral imperative for providing open access,§ the report says.It forecasts, with open migration, about 1,300 i-Kiribati and Tuvaluans would migrate to Australia and New Zealand annually, about 0.6% of those countries＊ combined annual permanent migration programs.※The two governments would prefer a slow outward flow resulting from voluntary migration and do not wish their peoples to be treated as ＆refugees＊ fleeing a hopeless economic and environmental situation.§Seventeen people from the Pacific 每 including 11 from Tuvalu and five from Kiribati 每 have already made refugee claims in New Zealand, citing climate change as part of their basis of claim. None have been successful (four have yet to be determined and 13 have been rejected) because the refugees convention does not recognise climate change as grounds for protection.Report author Prof Stephen Howes from the Australian National University said unrestricted access across national borders was unusual but it did occur, with some Pacific nations, such as the Federated States of Micronesia, granted open access to the US, effectively borderless travel between Australia and New Zealand, and free movement within the EU.※But there has to be something very special, very important to allow that free movement. It seems to us that climate change might provide such unusual circumstances as to give rise to open access.§He stressed the migration to Australia and New Zealand was not ※about emptying out those countries§ but with making them sustainable, economically and environmentally.Howes said it was important to have a pathway to permanent migration for Pacific Islanders coming to Australia and New Zealand so they could form diasporas that could assist later generations of migrants.※If you don＊t have that avenue for permanent migration, you won＊t establish a diaspora, and the most successful migrant communities we＊ve seen, for instance, the Indian community in Australia, thrive because of the personal and community links an established diaspora provides.§Open access migration for all Pacific Islanders has been proposed by a number of Australian thinktanks as a more effective mechanism than aid for lifting struggling Pacific states out of poverty.A December 2016 report by the  Leon Berkelmans and Jonathan Pryke argued that allowing just 1% of the Pacific＊s population 每 an average intake of fewer than 3,000 people 每 to work permanently in Australia would deliver a ※transformational impact§ and be of greater benefit to the people of the Pacific by 2040 than all of Australia＊s current aid to the region.Based on conservative assumptions, an uncapped migration model could increase the income of some Pacific Island countries 每 for the entire population, not just emigrants 每 by 300 to 400% over the next 25 years.※We are conscious that this focus is a different way of thinking about development but conventional thinking is clearly not working in the Pacific.§In March the  said Australia had been slow to realise the potential of the Pacific and suggested Australia create two dedicated visa categories for Pacific Island workers 每 a skilled visa and a labour exchange visa for unskilled work in a variety of seasonal industries.※The time is now ripe for Australia to reconsider how it engages with the Pacific workforce,§ the Menzies report says. ※Forecasts for labour demands suggest that the domestic labour supply will not be sufficient to meet demand in sectors like aged and community care, agriculture and tourism and hospitality. They are sectors with jobs that workers from the Pacific are potentially well-suited to fill.§Launching the Menzies Research Centre report, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said Australia had a substantial aid program in the region, focused on infrastructure, health, education, security and defence.※But foreign aid alone will not deliver economically sustainable and independent nations,§ she said. ※That＊s why we＊re focusing on seeking to build the economies of our Pacific Island neighbours.Bishop said Pacific labour migration to Australia was ※§.※Australia has some of our labour force shortages met but those from the Pacific gain skills, gain an opportunity, gain access to Australian qualifications, see Australian business practices and of course send home remittances.§The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told the Pacific Islands Forum in September that Australia was looking to make a ※§ in its relationship with the Pacific.Australia＊s relations with the region are expected to be a key element of the government＊s forthcoming migration white paper. Australia has run a seasonal workers program since 2012 每 which has attracted some criticism over worker exploitation 每 and, since last year, a Pacific microstates-northern Australia worker pilot, which provides multi-year visas for up to 250 workers from Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru.Bishop＊s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said climate change migration was not a priority.※Australia believes that the best response to climate change impacts, where feasible, is effective adaptation and well-supported internal relocation rather than resettlement.§The New Zealand government said its immediate climate change focus was on effective and comprehensive global mitigation to reduce emissions, and for the implementation of effective adaptation measures that reduce the vulnerability of countries and communities."																																																			
"Just four ocean beaches in all of New South Wales have been found to have poor water quality 每 but one is .According to an annual  by the state government, 207 of the 248 sites assessed (83%) were graded as good or very good 每 stable since 2013, and up from 81% in 2012-13.Only one was classified as very poor: Foreshore beach in Botany Bay, an estuarine beach that was often suitable for swimming but was ※very susceptible to faecal pollution§ from overflowing sewage discharge into a nearby creek.The proportion of good or very good was higher for ocean beaches in NSW, with 97% of 140 sites found to be suitable for swimming most or almost all of the time.Four ocean beaches were graded as poor, meaning they were ※susceptible to faecal pollution and ... not always suitable for swimming§: Terrigal and Avoca beaches on the Central Coast, and Coogee and Malabar in .The water quality of Coogee beach was downgraded from good to poor after it was found to be ※susceptible to faecal pollution§, frequently exceeding the safe limit for swimming after 20mm of rainfall or more.Coogee＊s new classification ※did not significantly increase the risk to public health§, but reflected frequent rainfall during the assessment period.Malabar beach was also found to be ※susceptible to faecal pollution§, and sometimes exceeded the safe swimming limit after little or no rain and regularly after 5mm or more of rainfall.Rod Kerr, the strategy manager at Sydney Water, said the water quality at both beaches had been heavily affected by severe and frequent rainfalls.He said the report＊s findings showed that Sydney＊s ocean beaches were, overwhelmingly, ※excellent§.※That＊s a great result and testament to the resilience of our beaches despite the intense rainfall. It also shows the benefit of all the investment put into our state＊s infrastructure.※To say that we have a widespread problem with our waterway is scaremongering and irresponsible.§He singled out the Daily Telegraph＊s report, which inferred that the faecal pollution was from humans. In fact, the bacteria found in the tests is present in the waste of all warm-blooded animals and is carried by stormwater off roads, gardens and parks.Nearby beaches in Clovelly, Bronte and Bondi were found to be stable and in very good or good condition. The best beaches in central Sydney were Clovelly, Maroubra and Nielsen Park.Rainfall was the biggest contributor of pollution to recreational waters, and 13 swimming sites were downgraded this year as a result of water quality samples from the wet summer and significant rainfall.Many coastal areas assessed had experienced their wettest January on record.A  the Deepwater Ocean Outfall program introduced 25 years ago to improve beach water quality in Sydney had provided about $2bn in social value to residents. The $300m investment made in 1991 by Sydney Water in the three deep ocean outfalls at North Head, Malabar and Bondi was found to have avoided illnesses for around 180,000 beach users each year, as well as increasing tourism and economic activity.More than $129m has been committed to improve the city＊s wastewater system and reduce its impact on swimming areas into next year.The NSW government＊s Beachwatch program monitors water quality of beaches and other swimming locations.

" is the most urgent challenge facing humankind. Other issues make headlines: terrorism kills; inequality affects everyday life for billions around the globe. But climate is paramount, because in sustainability human survival itself is at stake. Why then have the nations governing the planet been so hopelessly ineffective in addressing the grave environmental crisis?Is it because the consequences of carbon emissions seem hypothetical, or too far off? Politicians pay few costs for doing nothing, and receive little credit for acting aggressively. In the US, a nation that contributes  (China is responsible for another fifth), Donald Trump has promised to  and .The problem isn＊t the science. The merchants of doubt who claim there is a climate?science that is open to scientific debate are not  adversaries at all. They are political adversaries, mostly . It is in the realm of politics that the struggle for sustainability must be fought and won.Politics is hardly at its best right now, and that is perhaps the greatest challenge facing us. The weakness of politics undermines democracy 每 the faith behind politics. But democracy is crucial because climate change is also about justice: how to distribute the costs of decarbonisation and the transition to renewable energy fairly among rich and poor, developed and developing, large and small, north and south.This politics can＊t be found in increasingly dysfunctional nation states. The good news about the attempt to address climate change through government action is that it＊s happening. The bad news is that it＊s happening far too slowly. For every new hydroelectric plant built in the global north, some enormous lake dries up in the global south 每 Poop車, Bolivia＊s second largest, has .The US state of , but farmers there also grow pecans in semi-desert conditions where . For every urban fracking ban enacted, there is a move to block it in the courts. Coal is shut down, but fracked natural gas is accepted as a ※transition§ fuel 每 however .The best-case scenario for what is?likely to be done through nation-based environmental programmes hardly dents the worst-case scenario for the catastrophic consequences of all?that is?not being done.However, there is an ample menu of?sustainable options available to cities wishing to address climate change aggressively 每 and they can amplify their?impact by coordinating their policies. The list includes divestment of?public funds from carbon energy companies; investment to encourage renewable energy and green infrastructure; municipal carbon taxes; fracking?and drilling bans; new waste incineration technologies; regulation of the use of plastic bottles and bags; policies to improve public transport and?reduce car?use; and recycling.Oslo has been in the forefront of sustainable urban development. With Norway＊s energy needs almost completely met by hydroelectric power, and its lion＊s share of North Sea oil and gas going almost entirely to exports, almost all of the income goes to . Oslo has?thus had the luxury of pursuing a , and appears likely to achieve that goal by 2025.The city is applying the goal with particular efficiency to transportation, and electric vehicle charging stations are plentiful. The plan is to make Oslo the most electric vehicle-friendly city in the world 每  每 and a champion of green housing and architecture: its  is set in a neighbourhood that gleams with green infrastructure.Asia also has exemplary green-leaning?cities, including Hong Kong and?Seoul. The greater Seoul region has?a?population of almost 25 million, and  it was ranked the continent＊s?most sustainable city. Seoul?has made a massive investment in?electric-powered buses. It already has?the world＊s third largest subway system, but its carbon fuel bus fleet of 120,000 vehicles has been a massive source of pollution. Current plans are to convert half this fleet to electric by 2020, which would be the world＊s most ambitious achievement of this kind.Such approaches can be undertaken to great effect one city at a time, but they are also mutually reinforcing: networks of collaborating cities can amplify their global impact. They can also make it more difficult for courts or governments to oppose environmental initiatives, standing firm on common approaches to sustainability and decarbonisation.The challenge facing cities and citizens is to summon the necessary political will to do the things we know how to do 每 but have not done 每 and then to do them democratically. That will not be easy because democracy is in trouble, because . But the fate of the campaign against climate change and other existential threats depends on democratic politics within and among cities.Cities are the coolest political institutions on Earth. The odds are two to one or better that you live in a town or city, and not just for economic reasons. Spend a few days in Singapore or Cape Town or Nashville. Witness , or  or . Keen to confront global warming, but not yet fully empowered to do so, cities must not only accept their responsibility for assuring a sustainable world but assert their right to do so.There are two formidable obstacles blocking a larger role for cities: a paucity?of resources and the absence of?autonomy and jurisdiction. The European Union favours regions over cities, and works more on agricultural subsidies than affordable urban housing. In the United States, the structure of congressional representation means a suburban and rural minority rules over the urban majority.If cities are to get the power they need, they will have to demand the right of self-governance 每 as I argued in my book . The Global Parliament of Mayors, an  and the ※global city rights movement§, held its inaugural session in The Hague last year.Because urban citizens are the planet＊s majority, their natural rights are endowed with democratic urgency.?They carry the noble name of ※citizen§, associated with the word ※city§. But the?aim is not to set urban against rural:?it is to restore a more judicious balance between them. Today?it is cities?that look forward, speaking to global common goods, while fearful nations look back.The world is getting too hot. Science makes it clear that sustainability is both?necessary and possible. Politics shows it is achievable. Cities are poised?to make it happen.

"he giant squid, democracy, mental health, migration 每 big beasts, one and all. And each plays a role in Leviathan, a cycle of 10 films by artist Shezad Dawood that traces links from human activity to marine ecology and back again. The fates of crayfish, phytoplankton and spots on the sun are intertwined with that of the  in ill-suited vessels, heading for countries swinging away from liberal democracy.Leviathan is, as its name suggests, ambitious verging on the unwieldy: Dawood jokes that he and his wife refer to the project simply as LV around the home, to stop him freaking out. As well as the films 每 to be shot and released over the next three years 每 there＊s a novel, paintings, sculptures and a series of talks and symposia featuring scientists and researchers who have contributed. The first two episodes, as well as a suite of paintings on cloth and a lustrous resin sculpture, will all be shown in Venice alongside .Ironically, the project commenced with a severe attack of writer＊s block. Commissioned to pen an essay on democracy for an art publication in 2013, Dawood＊s writing didn＊t exactly go to plan. ※About two years later,§ he says, ※I had reams of notes that read like somebody with severe multiple personality disorder.§ He finally confessed to the editor that, instead of a coherently argued piece, all he had to offer were thousands of unprintable jottings that ※contradicted each other over and over again. I almost shift from Marxist to fascist from one paragraph to the next.§ The editor suggested that, rather than trying to reconcile the split, Dawood approach the subject as a work of fiction 每 and Leviathan was spawned.Based in east London, and with a body of work encompassing everything from painting to virtual reality, Dawood is not an artist who pursues one thought single-mindedly for long. Writing his multiple-personality novel on democracy, he started thinking ※almost in parallel, about a connection between the top of the sea and the bottom§. It was 2015 and the news was full of  across the Mediterranean. Dawood＊s interest in environmental matters drew him to find links to changes taking place within the water itself.※I started going out and meeting with oceanographers, political scientists, migrant rights activists and neurologists. I started asking very smart people whether there was a connection between mass migration and marine conservation. I was shocked by how much they jumped on it.§At the , an engineer explained to Dawood that the route from north Africa to the Italian island of  went right over a hump on the ocean floor that had become a kind of faultline for . Waters warming on one side were creating an imbalance: ※The displacement of that water creates the squalls, currents and riptides that make that crossing so dangerous, so there＊s a direct relationship between climate change in the Med and how dangerous those crossings are.§Dawood also learned that the same environmental factors were causing a parallel migration in the sea itself, with non-native species, such as the heavy-metal-munching Louisiana , taking over the territory of its European counterpart, which changed the ecosystem and had an economic impact on the fisheries. One marine biologist told Dawood that as a left-leaning progressive, his sympathies were with the human migrants 每 but that his working days were spent trying ※to prevent alien and  coming across that hump§.At the University of Milan, he met researchers who gathered the human remains, and the belongings, of migrants who had died when their ships capsized off Lampedusa: ※The idea is to build up a kind of archive to help relatives find closure.§ Going through photographs of their findings, Dawood found images of small plastic bags that he assumed to contain drugs, but which turned out to be earth, brought from their homelands.For a keen reader of , the great 17th-century work of political philosophy, it wasn＊t a big leap from democracy to creatures of the deep (Leviathan being the name of a sea monster in the Bible). But if all this sounds like an indigestibly doom-laden mash-up of Panorama and David Attenborough, think again. Described by a fellow artist as ※grindhouse Derek Jarman§, Dawood＊s film output bears evidence to his interest in genre and B-movies. He favours the terms ※punkish§ and ※freaky§ when describing his work., narrated by a character called Ben, is filled with manic onomatopoeia and Tourette＊s-style tics. The story, such as one can grasp it, rattles between visits to the giant squid in its specimen tank in London＊s  and memories of a global disaster featuring sunspots,  and mass suicide. Dawood recalls one spicy passage, about monkey-men masturbating to internet porn, causing a frisson when the piece played to prospective funders. ※Monkey on monkey, multiple monkey penetration, with and without plastic penetrative aids, monkey on goat＃§The novel will be released chapter by chapter online, echoing both the political pamphleteering of Hobbes＊s era, and the serialisation of Victorian novels. Dawood takes a more contemporary point of reference for the film cycle, referring to it (only half jokingly) as a ※box set§. Anyone wanting to binge-watch will have to wait until 2020, though, when the cycle is slated for completion.With shooting locations that trace the migration route from North Africa in reverse, Dawood is on the hunt for spectacular sites that bring historical resonance to the work. The lighthouse and fortifications of the  breakwater, for example, make it into episode two, exuding post-apocalyptic squalor. ※It＊s not that hard to find the end of the world,§ says Dawood cheerfully, ※if you＊re looking for it.§"																																																			
"David Cameron＊s No 10 policy chief warned him a year ago that he was ※exposed on Heathrow§ because the government did not have an answer to its impact on air quality, an internal Downing Street note has revealed.The memo was written by Camilla Cavendish, a former Downing Street adviser, who was scathing about the first draft of a government air quality plan from the department of the then environment secretary, Liz Truss.※There are three problems with Liz＊s clean air plan as currently written,§ the note from September 2015 says. ※First it is still very much a draft which quotes initiatives that are likely to be abolished ＃ Second it both overclaims and underwhelms.※It says we want the cleanest air in the world but does not even begin to tackle the fundamental question of how we might help people to shift away from diesel cars. Third, it leaves us exposed on Heathrow where we don＊t yet have an answer on air quality.§ This week in the high court, ClientEarth, an environmental law group, has argued that the government＊s plan to clean up levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) fails to adhere to the law.Theresa May is preparing to make a , with all the signs pointing to a choice of a third runway at Heathrow. She came under fire on Tuesday for  on expansion for another year. Sadiq Khan, the  mayor, who backs expansion at Gatwick, said: ※The government＊s decision to yet again delay deciding where to build a new runway will cause unnecessary uncertainty for British businesses already struggling with Brexit.※Now more than ever, businesses need certainty and stability in order to make investment decisions and to keep jobs in Britain. Instead they are getting dither and delay.§Sources at No 10 rebutted the suggestion that there had been any delay to airport expansion plans, saying there was no change in the timetable and a decision on developing either Heathrow or Gatwick would be taken next week.Cameron put off the decision on Heathrow in early December last year, saying the government would undertake more work on the environmental impact of airport expansion. But the government published its national air quality plan  with little reference to Heathrow and has not expanded on it publicly since then.Cavendish, who is now a Conservative peer, said on Wednesday night: ※Now this is in the public domain I have to say that I believe successive governments have failed the public on air quality. Too many people in Whitehall and parliament think they can play it down because it＊s invisible. ※But the scientific evidence shows that air pollution, especially particulates from diesel vehicles, is a growing threat to health. I continue to believe that government policy underwhelms and overclaims, including on Heathrow where expansion will increase pollution.§Air pollution causes 50,000 early deaths and ?27.5bn in costs every year, according to the government＊s own estimates, and was called a ※§ by MPs in April.Observers said Cavendish＊s briefing to Cameron showed the government knew Heathrow expansion was problematic for compliance on air quality, and that the handful of  were not enough to tackle pollution from diesel cars.Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green party and MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: ※This revelation confirms what many of us have been saying for months: Heathrow expansion cannot go ahead if we＊re serious about protecting the environment. Not only would expansion mean additional emissions from aircraft, but it＊s highly likely that there would be more fumes from road traffic blighting the local area too. The government has clearly buried this inconvenient memo in the hope of railroading this section through, irrespective of its legality and the impact on local people.§Simon Birkett of the Clean Air in London campaign said: ※Whether it＊s a big or little impact, it doesn＊t matter if it makes it [compliance] worse. This briefing shows us what I call free-market anarchists like George Osborne 每 people who say the car is king, and want no regulation on anything 每 have a disregard for human health.§The Davies commission on airport expansion said that a bigger Heathrow would mean extra traffic on Bath Road near the airport, leaving it with the highest concentrations of NO2 in the Greater London area. That ※would delay compliance with the directive and hence would not be deliverable within the legal framework§, the commission＊s final report said.A Heathrow source said: ※Heathrow accepted the conditions of the Davies commission in May this year. The airports commission were always clear there were no issues with air quality. However, if a judicial review or another legal case is brought, government has to have done its own research into everything the Davies commission has said. It＊s not enough to say the airports commission came to a particular conclusion. ※So they have to look into the air quality plans themselves. However, if Theresa May approves Heathrow next week, it will have done those investigations by now. They will not go ahead with expansion, anywhere, if they had found air quality limits were going to be in breach, because it＊s a legal requirement.§The airport＊s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye,  that a study by Cambridge University into air pollution had bolstered Heathrow＊s case.The university＊s Prof Rod Jones, who has been using sensors to monitor air pollution around the airport, said his research showed the air quality problem at Heathrow was due to road traffic, not planes, and that cleaner car engines being mandated by law would bring NO2 levels down below what they are now.※We would expect ＃ the traffic-related signature [of NO2 emissions] to drop below what it is today ＃ even though there may be more traffic,§ said Jones, whose study is due to be published in about a month＊s time. A government spokesman said: ※The government is firmly committed to improving the UK＊s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. That＊s why we have committed more than ?2bn since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low-emissions vehicles, support greener transport schemes and set out a national plan to tackle pollution in our towns and cities. We cannot comment on ongoing legal proceedings.§"																																																			
																																																			
"Scientists are investigating the mysterious deaths of at least 10,000 endangered frogs, in a river which leads into South America＊s most famous lake on Peru＊s border with Bolivia.The dead Titicaca water frogs were found along a 50km (30 mile) stretch of the Coata river, a tributary which flows into the 8,372 sq km Lake Titicaca, .Researchers are trying to find out what killed the amphibians in such numbers. The Titicaca water frog () is  by the IUCN red list on threatened species, and is endemic to the lake.The world＊s largest aquatic frog, weighing up to two pounds, has large folds of skin, which give it a wrinkly appearance 每 it is jokingly referred to as the Titicaca scrotum frog. The skin increases its surface area so the amphibian can absorb more oxygen. Roberto Elias,  programme manager for US-based Denver Zoo, who has been studying the frog since 2010, said only toxins could have caused such ※high mortality so quickly§.Previous studies had shown high levels of heavy metals in the lake caused by mining tailings from both formal operations and illegal gold mining in surrounding rivers, he said. They include lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, iron and zinc.※Villagers had been cleaning garbage from the river which may have disturbed the sediments,§ Elias added, although he stressed post-mortem studies on the frogs had not yet been completed.Other  due to a lack of sewage treatment plants and pesticides from agriculture surrounding the world＊s highest navigable lake, he said.Local anti-pollution campaigner Maruja Inquilla Sucasaca, took 100 dead frogs to the main square in the regional capital Puno, to draw the situation to the attention of the authorities.※No one took the pollution problem seriously until I showed them the dead frogs,§ she told the Guardian.※Lake Titicaca used to be a paradise, now we can＊t use the water and our livestock die if they drink it,§ said Inquilla, who is vice president of the local committee against the contamination of the Coata river. ※Untreated sewage is being pumped into the lake from the big towns and the authorities don＊t care,§ she said crying with frustration.Last October Inquilla accused the mayor of the Coata district of delaying a plant to treat the river water contaminated by sewage emitted by the region＊s most populous city, Juliaca. Pollution is not the only threat to the endangered frog. They are also hunted and eaten in regional dishes or transported to Lima and other cities as part of  because they are believed to have aphrodisiac properties.The IUCN red list says the frog has declined in numbers by more than 80% over the last three generations, due to over-exploitation, habitat degradation and invasive species. Trout, which is not native to the lake, have been introduced and eat the frog＊s eggs and tadpoles, says Elias.※The threat is much higher and the examples of the species we find are much smaller. If this trend continues they could disappear,§ he added. "																																																			
"Groups representing Britain＊s 600,000 doctors and health professionals say it is ※imperative§ to phase out coal rapidly to improve health and reduce NHS costs.The doctors and nurses say tackling outdoor air pollution from traffic and power stations would cut climate emissions, reduce air pollution, and deliver a powerful boost to the nation＊s health.※Climate change and air pollution are both major health threats,§ says the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change in a report. ※They share a common driver: the combustion of fossil fuels.  from coal plants alone costs the UK as much as ?3.1bn each year in human health impacts.§The group of 15 health bodies includes seven royal colleges of medicine and the British Medical Association.Pollution from coal plants causes many serious health conditions including stroke, coronary heart disease and lung cancer. It disproportionally affects children and kills more people than road accidents , says the report.The government has said it intends to phase out coal power plants by 2025 but the doctors say they are alarmed that no consultation papers looking at how this could be achieved have been published in more than a year. ※Ending the use of coal is a simple, no-regrets public health intervention. The rapid phase-out of coal fired stations is an imperative first step.  is the most carbon-intensive source of power generation, and is a key focus for reducing the risks of climate change.※In the UK, burning coal is linked to 1,600 premature deaths, 68,000 additional days of medication, 363,266 working days lost and more than 1m incidents of lower respiratory symptoms,§ says the report.It urges politicians not to tackle air pollution and climate individually, as has been done in the past. ※The UK has witnessed ... policies that encouraged the use of diesel cars which inadvertently worsened air quality. Considering air pollution and climate change together can limit adverse health effects. ※Some strategies can be good for both air quality and climate change, for instance wind, solar and tidal energy. Acting on ones that are beneficial to both is advantageous to health. Indeed, joining up policies on health, air pollution and climate change can offset the costs of climate mitigation policies through the health benefits that they bring.§Air pollution is the second biggest public health threat in the UK after smoking and kills 40,000 people a year in Britain, said Prof John Middleton, president of the Faculty of Public . ※Coal-fired energy is particularly damaging through its invisible particulates and because it is a driver of climate change,§ he said.※The phase-out of coal use is an essential step towards creating a sustainable energy policy for the UK,§ said Dr Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal. ※It is also a vital co-benefit for health - ending coal use will deliver long-lasting health and dividends for the British population. Life expectancies will be prolonged, disease and disabilities reduced, and future risks to health diminished. This is an opportunity to be seized.§ Jonathan Griggs, professor of paediatric respiratory and environmental medicine and fellow of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said that children were particularly vulnerable to burning coal. ※Air pollution from burning coal has been linked to low birth weight and pre-term delivery as a result of maternal exposure during pregnancy,§ he said. ※The phase-out of coal is a double win for tackling the twin health threats of air pollution and climate change.§ ※Tackling air pollution and climate change will have numerous health benefits but it requires a joined-up approach from government to ensure the health impacts are better recognised and fully realised,§ said Janet Davies, the Royal College of Nursing＊s chief executive and general secretary."

Today, around  of illness linked to emissions. On Monday, medics from the Faculty of Public Health published a report in Scotland urging rapid and radical replanning of our towns for the sake of safety. They had in mind air quality, not collisions or obesity.Everybody knows this. Everybody computes the cause and effect. Yet we are encouraged to stop our ears and ignore it as best we can. Incentives for people to quit their motors remain minimal. Cheerleading for top rides is still an endlessly indulged national pastime. Such widespread blitheness means any suggestion that people might have a moral responsibility not to slowly kill others while on the school run is met with scoffing.Small wonder: it＊s easy to ignore something that＊s invisible. From the driver＊s seat you can＊t see the stuff spewing out to poison passing pedestrians. It＊s also easier to care less. Being in a car is insulating. You transport your own space to the outside world, dominate your surroundings, totally imposing. People like driving because it enables individualism, as well as propulsion. The less contact you have with other people, the less you factor them into your actions.But the key reason such behaviour continues is that it is perpetuated by the rich, and its losers are the poor. The convenience of the wealthy is consistently prioritised. We start with cars. The community must adapt or die trying. The keys to our cities are now found in dashboards, not the pockets of the people.Every day, I walk to the station along a street lined with largely multiple-occupancy terraces built about 40 years before it was classified as a B-road. Usually, it＊s a slog. There＊s a lot of traffic 每 about the same capacity as the A-road which runs parallel, despite the absence of bus routes. Plus, the pavement is often impassable. Parked cars line both sides of the street and are permitted to take up half the pavement too. Negotiating your way is grim, even without a wheelchair or buggy.But for the past couple of months, this road has been closed to through traffic because of repairs to a railway bridge. Now, it is heaven: or, rather, it is the residential street it was intended to be. You can hear the birds, you can speak to people without shouting and then retching. But the absence of traffic is not, in fact, the most striking thing. Rather, it is the pavement. The number of parked cars has dropped dramatically. Now, there are just a scattering.Slowly, you twig: not only do the people who live on the street not drive down it, they don＊t park on it either 每 because by and large they don＊t own cars. Those vehicles belonged to residents of the 20 or so posher roads in the same residents＊ zone, cutting their commute by a couple of minutes by driving to the station.Wightman Road is a sacrifice zone, an abused vein running through protected territory. The winners here are the people who hit back by protesting (with a little justification, of course) that some car journeys are necessary. Who strenuously campaign for their own streets to be ring-fenced from congestion. Who endlessly press the case that not all cars are owned by those with bucketloads of lolly. Again: this has some truth. But  put the cost of buying a new car and running it for a year in the UK at ?18,901.?This is more capital than many people can muster.With money comes responsibility. Car ownership in India  over the next 24 years. Not every effect of a mass move out of poverty is wholly desirable. For it is always ultimately those with the very least who will suffer most.

"Far below the Dead Sea, between Israel, Jordan and Palestinian territories, researchers have found  in human experience.From depths of 300 metres below the landlocked basin, drillers brought to the surface a core that contained 30 metres of thick, crystalline salt: evidence that 120,000 years ago, and again about 10,000 years ago, rainfall had been only about one fifth of modern levels.The cause in each case would have been entirely natural. But in the region where human civilisation began, already in the grip of its , it is a reminder of how bad things could get and a guide to how much worse human-induced climate change could become.※All the observations show this region is one of those most affected by modern climate change and it＊s predicted to get dryer. What we showed is that even under natural conditions, it can become much drier than predicted by any of our models,§ said , a geochemist at Columbia University＊s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in the US.The Dead Sea is about 400 metres below sea level. It traps water from the  river and has, over millennia, become increasingly saline. In 2010, an international team of researchers drilled almost 500 metres below the deepest part of the Dead Sea bed to bring up evidence of a series of epic bygone droughts, when the trapped water evaporated to precipitate deep, dense beds of salts.One of these, , coincided with a  more than 115,000 years ago when the Earth＊s average atmospheric temperatures rose by about 4C hotter than the 20th-century average. This is roughly the rise predicted by climate change scenarios in which humans go on burning fossil fuels to deposit ever more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Rainfall in the region has fallen by 10% since 1950, and could continue to fall this century. In Syria, that has displaced millions and created a refugee crisis for Europe, and even briefly masked the entire region in an .And, repeatedly, archaeologists and climate scientists have found evidence of the role played by drought in the decline and collapse of civilisations, both in the ※ and in the .But the evidence from beneath the Dead Sea tells of droughts far worse than anything experienced in human history.

This means that if it keeps getting hotter now, it could stop running again.

"ne question I＊m asked a lot about my job is: how do you ※vet§ a one-tonne elephant seal? Well firstly, it makes the 300kg seals seem really titchy and easy. But why, you ask? Why have I travelled to  to immobilise elephant seals that can weigh from 250kg up to 1,000kg and more? My immediate answer is: who wouldn＊t do that if they had the chance, so I guess that＊s a bit telling. I＊m in awe of the extremes of the Antarctic and I love being a vet, but that＊s not all. The work itself is part of cutting-edge climate science as well as a chance for us to understand how one of the ocean＊s top predators interacts with its environment.The project I＊ve been working on, labelled ※Seals as Oceanographers§, is part of Australia＊s monitoring of the Southern Ocean through its Integrated Marine Observing System, supported by an Australian Antarctic Science Grant from the Australian Antarctic Division. It involves attaching tracking devices to the tops of elephant seal heads. These trackers provide information on seal movement, and the structure of the ocean itself. The Southern Ocean helps drive global-scale circulation, and up until seals pitched in, there was hardly any data, especially below the 60 degree South mark or in winter, where conventional sampling methods are near impossible. The trackers, in addition to telling us where the seals go and how deep they dive, collect information on ocean salinity, ocean temperature and depth. This allows researchers to understand how and where water masses form, something vital to understanding global heat and oxygen mixing rates. This project is part of an international collaboration at many sub-Antarctic and Antarctic sites.When it comes to sedating these huge beautiful predators in order to attach the tracking device, Dr Clive McMahon, expert seal biologist, and his research assistant catch the seal using a canvas head bag. Then I, as the Davis team veterinarian, step in and inject the seal with a drug agent (incidentally exactly the same one I use in my ※real-world§ job as a small animal veterinarian to sedate cats for grooming 每 but at a fraction of the dosage). The injection is given intravenously into the extra-dural vein, which is a vein running within the vertebral column and is one of several cool anatomical adaptations of elephant seals that enable them make their incredibly deep and long dives (down to 2km!). This involves sitting at the tail end of a not-particularly-pleased-about-it-seal and getting the injection in first go. The first time I tried this was possibly one of the most stressful veterinary moments in my career 每 second only to the first time I was asked a question as an actual vet, no longer a student. While I am never blas谷 about it, I＊m confident that I＊ll get the vein quickly and efficiently. This usually calms the seal down in about 30-60 seconds and lets us get on with our work.We weigh the seal, measure it (both girth and length) and glue the transmitter to the fur. All this time I＊ve been monitoring the anaesthetic, just like with a patient at home, and making sure he＊s alright (all the seals at Davis station are males. The females don＊t tend to come as far south).The whole procedure takes about 40 minutes and the patients show no evidence of distress afterwards. The drugs have a component that causes amnesia, and they often shuffle back for a snooze with their mates afterwards or head out for a lazy swim along the shore. Even better, some go straight off and start collecting data 每 the machine turns on as soon as they＊re in the water and stays on until they moult. Dr McMahon conducted a study that conclusively demonstrated no difference between growth and behaviour of tagged versus non-tagged seals. Except I think the tagged seals look infinitely more handsome, but then I always have been a fan of body-art. All the data is freely available to the global community, in real-time from the , as well as a number of open source journal articles, for those who are of an inclination to read scientific journals. Of all the work I＊ve done in the name of veterinary science 每 learning how to dart megafauna in South Africa (for research like fitting them with tracking collars), volunteering on carnivore projects in Botswana (leopards and lions), Zambia (African wild dogs) and Belize (jaguars) as well as conducting field work for my PhD following orangutans through the jungles of Borneo 每 this has been the most rewarding project I＊ve been involved with. It＊s such far-reaching science that incorporates excellent research on biology, ecology and climate science. Working on the Seals as Oceanographers project is a privilege and a joy 每 although, sometimes my fingers don＊t feel the same. I can＊t do anything dexterous, like give injections, with clumsy warm gloves, and it＊s something you feel (or not feel) in sub-zero temperatures. And Antarctica 每 there＊s really no place like it. I go to work surrounded by ellie seals, penguins and icebergs. I＊m the luckiest vet in the world."

"＊s mountaineers and gamekeepers have rarely seen eye to eye. But now they have put their differences behind them to oppose an apparently innocuous plan that both say threatens the country＊s landscape: a proposal to plant thousands of new trees.The Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) and Mountaineering Scotland admit they are unlikely bedfellows, having historically disagreed over access to land for walkers and issues of wildlife preservation. But they are united in their concerns over proposals that are part of the government＊s , which they say could threaten the country＊s ※dramatic open views and vistas§.The two groups have written to Scotland＊s environment secretary to raise issues about plans to increase the country＊s woodland cover from 17% to 25% by 2050. The Draft Climate Change Plan includes a commitment to plant 10,000 extra hectares of trees between now and 2020, extending to 15,000 hectares per year by 2024.Neil Reid of  Scotland acknowledges that the interests of hillwalkers and mountaineers had sometimes clashed with those of gamekeepers in the past, but said the two bodies had a shared interest in protecting the iconic Scottish landscape.※What we are arguing for is for a coherent policy,§ he said. ※There may well be arguments between all the various interested organisations about what that policy will eventually look like, and I imagine ourselves and the SGA will disagree on some issues, but what we＊re completely agreed on is that there is a need for an overarching policy to be developed§.In the letter addressed to the Scottish environment minister, Roseanna Cunningham, the two bodies said there has so far been a ※failure to join up what is required from the land to meet forestry targets and what we might want to keep in terms of internationally rare and valuable landscapes and ecosystems§.※While Scotland＊s open landscapes and upland moors are classed as rare in global terms, there is currently no policy position safeguarding them,§ the letter reads. ※Some areas are designated as of special ecological or scenic interest but most are unprotected and disregarded.§Scotland＊s woodland cover is about half of the average of other EU countries and less than one quarter of the woodland area that once covered much of Scotland＊s land. Among the benefits of ＆afforestation＊ cited by Scotland＊s forestry commission are its contribution to tackling greenhouse gas emissions, restoring lost habitats for wildlife and flood management. Kenneth Stephen, from the SGA, cited  they commissioned by ecologist Dr James Fenton titled ※A Future for Moorland in Scotland§. ※The report suggested that, because of a lack of policy vision, globally rare habitats in Scotland have been lost in a piecemeal manner over decades,§ he said.※What we are saying is that we don＊t want an unthinking loss of something that is so rare. What we really need is that overarching policy vision that puts these treasured landscapes at its heart.§The body has estimated that 20% of heather moorland disappeared between 1940 and 1970 and a further 500,000 hectares is under threat through the Scottish government＊s forestry strategy.A Scottish government spokesman said that the increased woodland creation targets announced as part of the Climate Change Plan would be taken forward in a sustainable way, that included working closely with a range of stakeholders. ※This will include appropriate consideration of Scotland＊s distinctive upland landscapes,§ they said."

He then, it seems, decided to bring this water to more people.Astonishingly, the governor of Svalbard has approved Qureshi＊s venture. He charters an icebreaker to make two expeditions a year, in the summer and the autumn when icebergs calve away from glaciers that run into the sea. One-tonne pieces of ice are carved from these floating bergs at a time.

Why travel in economy if you could travel first class? Why buy from the high-street when you could buy designer clothing ?

"Hopes that the world＊s huge carbon emissions might not drive temperatures up to dangerous levels have been dashed by new research. The work shows that temperature rises measured over recent decades do not fully reflect the global warming already in the pipeline and that the ultimate heating of the planet could be even worse than feared.How much global temperatures rise for a certain level of carbon emissions is called  and is seen as the single most important measure of climate change. Computer models have long indicated a high level of sensitivity, up to 4.5C for a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere.However in recent years estimates of climate sensitivity based on historical temperature records from the past century or so have suggested the response might be no more than 3C. This would mean the planet could be kept safe with lower cuts in emissions, which are easier to achieve.But the new work, using both models and paleoclimate data from warming periods in the Earth＊s past, shows that the historical temperature measurements do not reveal the slow heating of the planet＊s oceans that takes place for decades or centuries after CO2 has been added to the atmosphere.※The hope was that climate sensitivity was lower and the Earth is not going to warm as much,§ said Cristian Proistosescu, at Harvard University in the US, who led the new research. ※There was this wave of optimism.§The new research, , has ended that. ※The worrisome part is that all the models show there is an amplification of the amount of warming in the future,§ he said. The situation might be even worse, as Proistosescu＊s work shows climate sensitivity could be as high as 6C.Prof Bill Collins, at the University of Reading, UK, and not part of the new research, said: ※Some have suggested that we might be lucky and avoid dangerous climate change without taking determined action if the climate is not very sensitive to CO2 emissions. This work provides new evidence that that chance is remote.§ He said greater long term warming had implications for melting of the world＊s ice sheets and the rise of sea levels that already .The reason the historical temperature measurements indicated a lower climate sensitivity than models or paleoclimate data is because the Earth has a fast and a slow response to increases in carbon emissions, Proistosescu said. Land, mostly in the northern hemisphere heats up quickly. But there is also a slow response, he said: ※This is mostly associated with warming over the oceans. They are big and full of cold water, especially at depth, and take a long time to heat up.§ Furthermore, when the slow warming does kick in, it is likely to reduce the cloud cover that shades the Southern ocean and the eastern tropical Pacific, amplifying the heating. The new research shows the 4.5C upper limit for climate sensitivity is real and means projections for global temperature rises cannot be reduced. The  higher by the end of the century if emissions are not cut, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or 0.3C to 1.7C if sharp emissions cuts begin in the next few years.The world may already be seeing the increasing rises in temperature, said Prof Piers Forster at the University of Leeds, UK: ※It may already be happening 每 the  could be partly due to the eastern Pacific catching up.§Reconciling all the estimates of climate sensitivity has also shown that climate models are not flawed. ※Historical observations give us a lot of insight into how climate changes and are an important test of our climate models,§ said Prof Peter Huybers, a colleague of Proistosescu＊s at Harvard University. ※But there is no perfect analogue for the changes that are coming.§"																																																			
"Cash payments to persuade drivers who live in pollution hotspots to give up their diesel cars may be part of a new scrappage scheme under the government＊s air quality plans, due to be published in the next week.Downing Street has been mulling the idea after being forced to produce a new air quality plan after a court ruling, which said existing proposals to meet EU-mandated air quality limits .Under the plans, the scrappage scheme could encourage drivers to give up their diesel cars if they live in towns or cities with particularly acute pollution problems. There had been reservations about the idea of a scrappage scheme over fears it would be giving handouts to wealthy diesel owners who want to buy a new car.However, there is a growing sense in government that a substantial policy will have to be rolled out to persuade people to give up diesel cars, which emit nitrogen oxides that contribute to health problems such as asthma. It is understood discussions are ongoing about the scrappage scheme and other elements of the plan to reduce use of diesel cars, even though the deadline for producing a new document is just over a week away, on 24 April.The idea of a tailored scheme has been supported by Neil Parish, chair of the Commons environment committee, who will use a debate on Wednesday to raise the proposal.He will say that ※households should not just be able to trade in multiple diesels for a cash subsidy§, and argue that the government ※should particularly consider targeting a scrappage scheme at poorer households or those earning less than 60% of the median UK household income§.※If the government earmarked ?500m for this scheme, it would take nearly 10% of the 5m dirtiest diesels off our roads. Limiting the scheme to these hotspots could potentially take as many as half of these dirtiest diesels out of these pollution hotspots.§A poll by the AA in February found that just over two-thirds of drivers would support a diesel scrappage scheme, with 10% opposed. Other measures could include more low-emission zones or ※toxin taxes§ on diesel vehicles driving in pollution hotspots.Experts have been growing increasingly concerned about the impact of diesel fuel on nitrogen oxide levels, with worries heightened by the , when it emerged that cars emitted more toxic fumes on the road than had been apparent in laboratory tests.A subsequent  found that 37 top-selling diesel cars exceeded the legal limit required for laboratory pollution tests when driven for 90 minutes on normal roads.Consumers had been urged to switch away from petrol cars in a move to reduce carbon dioxide emissions under the last Labour government, which has made ministers anxious not to penalise those who bought diesel cars.Theresa May has hinted she is prepared to take some action in relation to diesel cars, saying last month that decisions were yet to be finalised.※But I＊m very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we＊re looking at what we do in the future,§ the prime minister said."																																																			
"e are approaching two years into implementing the ambitious  每 a historic agreement to end poverty, combat inequalities, promote peaceful and inclusive societies, and protect the environment. The new global framework, with 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) at its core, commits to promoting development in an integrated way 每 economically, socially and environmentally 每 in all countries, ensuring that no one is left behind.Our recently published report  that will shape the trajectories of 每 and could potentially undermine 每 progress on the SDGs. In the current context of a looming retreat from multilateralism, the choices governments and societies make to manage these long-term trends will be fundamental to whether the world can get onto a pathway of sustainable development.Substantial progress has been achieved in multiple dimensions of poverty in the past decades, including the reduction of absolute poverty, decline in child and maternal mortality rates, and improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Income inequality between countries has also been falling, mainly due to the rapid growth in large developing countries.Despite these gains, the progress has been uneven and considerable challenges remain. These include rising income disparities within countries, persistent gender inequality and the recent resurgence of poverty across regions due to economic shocks and escalating conflicts. The , which measures deprivation in health, education and living standards, counted 1.6 billion people living in multidimensional poverty in 2016 每 nearly twice the number of people living in extreme poverty measured by income alone.Progress towards eliminating poverty is more difficult during times of uncertain economic prospects, the report suggests. This is further complicated by weak labour market conditions, demographic changes, and conflicts and insecurity. Evidence shows that while economic growth is essential for reducing poverty, a critical link between growth and the reduction of poverty and inequalities is related to the nature and quality of growth, and a balanced distribution of gains across all segments of society.The implementation of the 2030 Agenda will be affected by demographic dynamics, including population growth, ageing, migration and urbanisation. In 2015,  (pdf), with rapid ageing expected to occur in Europe, North America, Asia and Latin America. In Africa, by contrast, populations are young, which provides an opportunity for a . It has become easier for people to move, and factors such as poverty, unemployment, conflicts and natural hazards compel people to leave their homes in search of better lives. International migration has  (pdf), accounting for 244 million migrants worldwide in 2015. If managed well, migration will continue to bring profound benefits to sending countries through remittances, knowledge and networks, and to receiving countries by filling acute labour shortages and contributions in terms of taxes and care services.Internal migration is also growing, driving fast increases in urbanisation. On one hand, urbanisation fosters growth and provides a higher quality of life, with cities  (pdf). On the other, it raises concerns about urban poverty, social tensions and disparities, changes in family patterns, and environmental risks.Major environmental challenges identified by the report include degradation of air and land, water scarcity, deforestation, marine pollution and a decline in biodiversity. Some of the underlying factors behind environmental degradation include population growth, polluting technologies, and overexploitation of ecosystems driven by unsustainable consumption and production patterns.The world is already witnessing the impact of climate change on natural systems. This is translated into the  (pdf), which lead to more disasters  (pdf) and patterns of economic development. Climate change is also projected to undermine food security, exacerbate existing health threats, adversely affect water availability and lead to increased displacement.In the coming decades, it is likely that this trend will continue, with more losses expected in livelihoods and assets. This underlines the link between poverty and vulnerability to natural hazards. It also exposes inequity, as countries and populations likely to be most harmed by climate change impacts are often the least responsible for causing them, and have limited capacity and resources to cope with the consequences.The report discusses various shocks and crises including economic and financial shocks, disasters, conflicts and disease outbreaks that have undermined the precarious livelihoods of millions of people and can affect progress towards sustainable development. Over the past decades, global forced displacement, for example, .The first year of SDG implementation was marked by  (pdf), weak investment growth and stagnant global trade. While progress has been made in reducing the global unemployment rate, nearly  (pdf) were estimated to be unemployed in 2016, including 71 million young people. Global economic prospects remain subject to various risks, including increasing policy uncertainty in major advanced and emerging economies, financial market disruptions and heightened geopolitical tensions.At the same time, remarkable achievements have been made in  over the past decades, which can be attributed to political commitment, strong global partnerships and . Despite this, the world continues to face significant challenges in addressing health issues and under-nutrition, with , and high risks of famine.To achieve the SDGs, development finance strategies need to go beyond filling financing gaps. While official development assistance will remain a vital source of external public finance for the poorest and most vulnerable countries, it will not be sufficient. All sources of finance 每 public and private, domestic and international 每 need to be mobilised. In particular, effective domestic resource mobilisation  (pdf) of financing sustainable development.While resources allocated for development objectives are not adequate, there is no shortage of capital in the global economy. The challenge is to enhance the impact of available resources, while catalysing additional sources of finance into investments in long-term sustainable development.It is critical to better align private sector incentives with sustainable development objectives through strengthened policies and sound institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks. As a positive trend, the private sector＊s involvement in philanthropic giving, corporate social responsibility initiatives, impact investing, and inclusive business approaches has been expanding.A number of innovative multi-stakeholder partnerships such as the  and new financing mechanisms for development including green bonds have emerged since 2000. It will be essential to scale up the proven mechanisms in size, scope and geographical reach.Technology is an important means for implementing the SDGs. The biggest technological advancements over the past decades have occurred in health, education and the environment. For example, the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases is estimated to . Online courses and interactive applications expand access to education around the globe, providing new ways of learning, teaching and collaborative work. Renewable energy technologies are critical in addressing climate change and its negative impacts.While technologies have provided innovative solutions to many development problems, they have also added new challenges and risks, including security and privacy concerns, polarising opportunities and job replacement. Forecasts suggest that computers could do the work of 140 million knowledge workers by 2025, while  (pdf) due to innovation in artificial intelligence.The multiple crises and disasters in recent decades have highlighted unpredictability and volatility in the global economy, continued uncertainties and disruptions in people＊s lives, and the vulnerability of development progress to external shocks. Against this backdrop, there is a challenge 每 and an opportunity 每 for a sophisticated policy response of preparedness, investment and cooperation.The report points to four main factors that are crucial in addressing these trends: the importance of evidence in decision-making; policy coherence across the global goals and at different levels of policymaking and implementation; collective action to maximise the positive dynamics in these areas and minimise risk; and broad-based inclusive participation."																																																			
"The G20 nations provide four times more public financing to fossil fuels than to renewable energy, a report has revealed ahead of their summit in Hamburg, where  has said climate change will be at the heart of the agenda.The  accuse the G20 of ※talking out of both sides of their mouths§ and the summit faces the challenge of a sceptical US administration after Donald Trump pulled out of the global Paris agreement.The public finance comes in the form of soft loans and guarantees from governments, and, along with huge fossil fuel subsidies, makes coal, oil and gas plants cheaper and locks in carbon emissions for decades to come. But scientists calculate that to keep global warming below 2C, most fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground, requiring a major shift of investment to clean energy.The new report by a coalition of NGOs found that the  countries provided an average of $71.8bn of public finance for fossil-fuel projects per year between 2013-2015, compared with just $18.7bn for renewable energy. Japan provided the most at $16.5bn per year, which was six times more than it allotted for renewables.China, which is curbing its coal use and increasingly being seen as a climate leader, provided $13.5bn for fossil fuels but just $85m for green energy. Germany, also seen a climate leader, provided $3.5bn of public finance for fossil fuels, compared with $2.4bn for renewables.Britain provided $972m for fossil fuels, compared with $172m for renewable energy.※When the G20 countries committed to the Paris agreement, they made a pact with the world that they would take meaningful steps to reduce their carbon emissions in an effort to avert the worst effects of the climate crisis,§ said Nicole Ghio of the Sierra Club, one of the groups that compiled the report. ※But as we now know, these countries have been talking out of both sides of their mouths. It＊s unconscionable that any nation would continue to waste public funds on fossil fuels when clean energy sources are readily available [and] more cost-effective and healthier for families and communities across the globe.§※G20 leaders may like to talk about climate, but it＊s clear their talk is cheap,§ said Kate DeAngelis at  US, another group behind the report. ※While praising each other for investing in renewable energy at home, they bankroll billions of dollars for dirty fossil fuel projects in developing countries.Ahead of the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July,  was high on the agenda. ※Since the decision of the US to quit the Paris climate agreement, we are more determined than ever to make it successful,§ she said. ※We must tackle this existential challenge, and we cannot wait until every last person on earth has been convinced of the scientific proof.§However, both the G20 and G7 groups have found it difficult to turn previous pledges on fossil fuel subsidies 每 which run at  每 into action. In 2009, the G20 said it would phase out fossil fuel subsidies, noting that doing so by ※by 2020 would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 by 10%§.But by 2016, the G20 had still failed to set a target date for the phase-out, despite the urging of the  and of . The  as the date to end fossil fuel subsidies in 2016 but this was dropped in 2017, after the  leaders in support of climate action.The new analysis found two G20 countries 每 Russia and Argentina 每 provided zero public financing for green energy, but more than $1bn each for fossil fuels.The report was produced by Oil Change International, Friends of the Earth US, the Sierra Club and  Europe. It included energy funding from multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, in which the G20 have significant voting shares and this accounted for a quarter of the total. The renewable category did not include nuclear energy or large hydro dams, but even with these included fossil fuel financing was still far bigger."																																																			
"A significant spill of firefighting foam at  airport has contaminated nearby waterways, killing fish and prompting warnings to recreational anglers.About 22,000 litres of the foam leaked in a Qantas hangar on Monday, the  government confirmed.About three-quarters was kept within the hangar＊s containment system but an undisclosed quantity entered the airport＊s stormwater system. The chemicals have contaminated the lower reaches of the Brisbane river. The impacted areas stretch from Bulimba creek to Fisherman Island, and further north to Shorncliffe.About 20 dead fish were discovered within the airport＊s boundaries. The Queensland government has linked their deaths to the spill. The spill happened about 9pm on Monday.  did not notify authorities until Tuesday. The Department of Environment and Heritage Protection is now investigating, and has taken samples from nearby waterways and the fish.The foam is believed to have contained . The chemicals do not easily break down in the environment or humans, according to .There is  that they are harmful to human health but the  and there is not enough evidence to fully understand their impact. Health authorities are warning recreational fishers to avoid the area as a precaution. Queensland＊s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, said people should avoid eating seafood from nearby areas.※I recommend people avoid eating seafood that was caught in the potentially contaminated area until the results of environment department testing are known,§ Young said. ※While there is currently no consistent evidence that PFOA exposure causes adverse health harm in humans, I understand this was a significant spill.§The environment minister, Steven Miles, said a joint Queensland-commonwealth investigation had begun. ※Failure to fully contain PFAS firefighting foams is contrary to Queensland government policy, however the Brisbane airport is a commonwealth-regulated site,§ Miles said.※As such, this is now a joint investigation between the Queensland and commonwealth governments,§ he said.Qantas issued a statement on Friday morning, saying it was investigating the leak. It said most of the chemical was contained but some had overflowed into a nearby creek.※The creek was quickly bunded to stop the fire retardant from flowing downstream,§ Qantas said. ※We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously.※We notified the Queensland government and we＊re working with Brisbane airport on the clean-up and the investigation.§Brisbane airport confirmed it was working with Qantas but directed further questions to the airline. Qantas has engaged a specialist contractor to recover the waste and is storing recovered material in a container within the airport.Queensland authorities are investigating the entry of foam into the Luggage Point sewage treatment plant, which discharges into the Brisbane river.※EHP officers attended the site again today to continue monitoring the onsite response to the situation,§ Miles said on Thursday. Last year NSW authorities launched their own investigation of contaminated sites, including airports, firefighting training facilities and industrial sites."																																																			
"During the day they curl up in nests of shredded paper but when night falls those that are well enough scurry and snuffle around the old fish boxes that serve as their temporary homes. These hedgehogs at the RSPCA＊s  in Somerset have had a tough time of it. Some have tangled with dogs, strimmers, bonfires, fruit netting or vehicles; others have been brought in as tiny unseeing hoglets, having lost their parents.  The hedgehogs, which arrive here from as far afield as south Wales and Cornwall, will be nursed back to health by vets and animal carers, and released either close to where they were found or into a hog-friendly piece of West Country countryside.  They are 每 relatively speaking 每 the lucky ones. Figures out this week show a deeply worrying wider trend.  One quarter of the 139,000 gardens surveyed did not record a single sighting in the whole of 2016.  The survey, carried out by citizen scientists, echoes what the experts are saying. Nobody knows exactly how many hedgehogs live in Britain but the  says the number has fallen by 30% to under a million in the past 15 years. In the 1950s, the number was estimated at 36.5m, though the campaign, run by the and the , accepts this figure may be on the high side. , an ecologist and a leading hedgehog expert, said the beloved creature was facing a crisis in the town and the country. He believes populations of rural hedgehogs may have dropped by up to 75% since the turn of the century. ※You might think rural hedgehogs are having a better time,§ he said. ※They＊re certainly not.§  The problems hedgehogs face are clear 每 traffic, development of green spaces, fragmentation of habitat. The latter is one that could easily be solved, Warwick argues. One square kilometre of the best-quality land is needed for a viable hedgehog population. It is crucial that hedgehogs can move freely around this area, so one relatively simple measure gardeners could take is to cut holes in fences to aid freedom of movement. Meanwhile, in the countryside the loss of hedgerows 每 hedgehogs are edge-living creatures 每 has hit the hogs badly. And there is less food for them.  ※People don＊t talk about that,§ he said. ※It＊s too complicated and too scary.§  Warwick said that hedgehogs also had a ※complicated§ relationship with another British beast, the badger. The two species had got on well since the last ice age, but in recent years a problem has developed.  Warmer, wetter winters and more maize, mean badgers are thriving. This has led to greater competition for invertebrates, which both animals feed on. If the badgers can＊t find enough worms, they look elsewhere 每 and hedgehogs become a protein-rich source of food for them. Then there is the contact hedgehogs have with humans, which can often lead to injury or death.RSPCA data reveals that over the past three years, from 1,414 in 2013 to 2,352 in 2016. The expectation is that this pattern will continue this year. The charity is urging people to become more ※hedgehog aware§. Scientific officer Llewelyn Lowen said: ※Simple things like checking before you start strimming or using your garden fork, remembering to put sports netting away when it＊s not in use and keeping drains covered can really make a difference and help protect the welfare of these iconic creatures.§ assistant Lorna Handoll, who was in charge of the West Hatch hogs on Friday, is kept very busy. The hedgehogs she cares for have different characters. She lifted one out of its fish box because she knew it did not mind the daylight and would not curl up into a ball. She knows to be careful handling another because it fancies itself as an escapologist. A brick has been placed on the lid of its box because of its habit of getting on its surprisingly long hind legs and pushing its way out.  Handoll said it was hard not to become too attached to the hedgehogs she cares for. She admitted she gives some of them names. She recently hand-reared a pair of babies she called Dill and Sage. ※Their eyes were closed when they came to us,§ Handoll said. ※After two or three days the eyes open.§ Dill and Sage have now been released close to Handoll＊s home 每 and she is looking out for them, hoping they will be among the increasingly few that live a long, healthy life."																																																			
"After an absence of 1,300 years, the lynx could be back in UK forests by the end of 2017. The Lynx UK Trust has announced it will  for six lynx into the Kielder forest, Northumberland, following a  with local stakeholders.The secretive cat can grow to 1.5m in length and feeds almost exclusively by ambushing deer. Attacks on humans are unknown, but it was hunted to extinction for its fur in the UK. The Kielder forest was chosen by the trust from five possible sites, due to its abundance of deer, large forest area and the absence of major roads.Sheep farmers and  are opposed to the reintroduction, but Dr Paul O＊Donoghue, chief scientific advisor to the Lynx UK Trust and expert adviser to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) believes there are good reasons for reintroducing the predator.※Lynx belong here as much as hedgehogs, badgers, robins, blackbirds - they are an intrinsic part of the UK environment,§ he told the Guardian. ※There is a moral obligation. We killed every single last one of them for the fur trade, that＊s a wrong we have to right.§Rural communities would also benefit from eco-tourism, O＊Donoghue said: ※They will generates tens of millions of pounds for struggling rural UK economies. Lynx have already been reintroduced in the Harz mountains in Germany. They have branded the whole area the ＆kingdom of the lynx＊. Now it is a thriving ecotourism destination and we thought we could do exactly the same for Kielder,§ he said. Lynx would also boost the natural environment, said O＊Donoghue, by reducing the overgrazing of forests by deer, allowing other wildlife to flourish. ※We have a massive overpopulation of roe deer in the UK,§ he said. ※We are one of the most biodiversity poor countries in the world. We need the lynx, more than the lynx needs us.§The lynx that may be released in Kielder would come from Sweden, where there is a thriving population, and all would have GPS collars reporting their location at all times. ※They will be the most studied animals in Britain,§ said O＊Donoghue, who has also advised on the reintroduction of the  bird in Britain and black rhinos and chimpanzees in Africa. The plan is to release two males and four females, all young adults, as part of the trial is to see if the animals will breed.Phil Stocker, National Sheep Association chief executive said: ※Even if compensation were offered, it will not make sheep mortalities acceptable. I cannot see how distressing attacks caused by a wild animal will be accepted [by the public].※We are confident that pastoral livestock farming already delivers a highly attractive countryside with environmental, economic and social benefits.§ he said. ※I cannot accept that lynx could improve or deliver anything more.§O＊Donoghue said: ※You will never see a lynx running across an open field chasing down prey 每 they can＊t do it. They are the epitome of a forest specialist 每 their coat is dappled.§ He said research across Europe has shown that wild lynx kill only one sheep every two and half years, while millions of sheep are lost each year in the UK to malnutrition, disease and exposure: ※We completely understand the perceived risk of lynx, but it is only perceived.§The Lynx UK Trust will submit its application for a five-year trial introduction to Natural England (NE) in the coming weeks. ※We could have lynx back on the ground in 2017,§ said O＊Donoghue. ※We have taken the concerns of stakeholders and used them to design a project plan which we believe mitigates any risk. At this time we do not see any reasons why a licence would not be forthcoming.§ An NE spokeswoman said it will consider the application under existing laws and the IUCN guidelines for reintroductions, which the Lynx UK Trust says it has followed. ※Any decision to grant a licence to reintroduce lynx into the wild in England will be based on the impacts on affected communities, the wider environment and follow international guidelines.§The trial reintroduction would also need to have an ※exit strategy§, NE said. O＊Donoghue said the Lynx UK Trust is confident the trial would be success, but if not: ※We will be the first people taking those lynx in.§Beavers, which had been absent since the 16th century, have been  and also in Scotland, where they are now , while the great bustard bird was first reintroduced in 2004.If lynx are reintroduced, it would be very difficult for eco-tourists to see the mainly nocturnal animals, O＊Donoghue said: ※Lynx are very secretive and elusive, but that＊s completely irrelevant. It＊s a chance to walk in a forest where lynx live, a chance to see a lynx track, to see a lynx scratching post. And if you did see a lynx in the wild, it would be the wildlife encounter of a lifetime.§"																																																			
"s any six-year-old will tell you, there is only one venomous snake native to Britain: AKA the common European adder. Still, it can give you a nasty bite, and doctors have warned that .※I＊m astonished by the number of people who know they＊ve been bitten but just go home,§ says , a professor of clinical toxicology at the University of Edinburgh and a snake expert. ※Then they wake up with massive swelling, when treatment is far less effective.§An adder hasn＊t killed anyone in Britain for decades, but the effects for the 100 or so people bitten each year 每 almost always on warm days 每 . ※I have a photo of a poor 60-year old woman who had to have an adrenaline infusion in the helicopter ambulance after she was bitten on the ankle in the New Forest,§ Eddleston says.Happily, there are simple steps we can take to recover from adder bites 每 and avoid them in the first place. ※Look where you＊re walking, especially on warmer areas such as paths, where snakes like to sun themselves,§ Eddleston says. ※We see them a lot in south Wales, the New Forest, Devon and along the east coast of England.

We had a little boy bitten underwater in a park recently.§ Adders can grow up to 75cm in length and have a dark zigzag pattern down their backs. ※If you see one, stay still and then back off,§ Eddleston advises. Like most animals, they only attack humans when they feel threatened. Not all bites leave a clean pair of holes. ※Sometimes they slash with one fang. Sometimes they have two pairs of fangs, so you＊ll see four marks,§ says Eddleston. Almost a third of bites are ※dry§ 每 in other words, venom is not transferred 每 but it can be hard to know whether this was the case. What is Eddleston＊s biggest tip?

If there is, usually after a couple of hours, you can receive antivenom straight away and make a full recovery.§ Don＊t try to treat a bite yourself with creams, tourniquets or anything else. ※And don＊t try to suck it out,§ Eddleston adds. ※It doesn＊t work.§"																																																			
"Unregulated culling of Scotland＊s mountain hares should be banned and the species protected, according to a report that says shooting the animals for sport is inhumane and uncontrolled.Landowners can shoot the hares without a licence from August to February and claim culls are necessary to protect game, especially red grouse, from disease.Campaigners say death rates of hares, which are native to the Highlands and thrive on grouse moors, are not monitored.  published on Monday, said: ※Population data is sparse but suggests mountain hares are in decline. Yet they are widely persecuted for sport and as part of organised culls.§At least 25 game estates were currently offering the opportunity to shoot mountain hares for sport, it said, with no guarantees this was not driving decline. It estimates about 40% of hares killed were for shot for sport, while about 50% died as part of organised culls.It was impossible to know how many were killed as mountain hare killing was secretive and carried out in remote locations, the charity said. One estimate was that 25,000 were killed in 2006-07 每 a figure now 10 years old, OneKind said.The report highlights three culls that it claims took place on grouse moors, including two carried out last year on the Balmoral estate in Royal Deeside.Mountain hares are classified as a priority species by the .The Scottish government has called for voluntary restraint on the issue. A spokesman said: ※We have been very clear that we will not tolerate large-scale culls of mountain hares but we recognise that numbers need to be controlled in some specific circumstances.§It is setting up an independent review to examine the sustainability of grouse moor management, including hare-culling.Data on hare populations is widely disputed. The last estimate was made in 1995 when 350,000 mountain hares were thought to exist.OneKind states the population could be between 175,000 and 500,000 hares, fluctuating year-on-year, but said monitoring by the British Trust of Ornithology 每 albeit for a limited sample size 每 suggested an overall decline of 34% between 1996 and 2014.Harry Huyton, OneKind＊s director, said: ※Mountain hares are an iconic species in  that should be protected. Our report shows that instead they are persecuted in enormous numbers for entertainment. The killing is unregulated, and there are no guarantees that it is not further driving the decline of these species or causing unacceptable suffering.※Today, the day before the open season begins, OneKind is calling on the Scottish government to take urgent action and introduce a moratorium on large-scale hunts and culls before the season gets into full swing.§Hares can be killed under licence from Scottish National Heritage. But, in addition to organised culls there are driven and walked-up shooting of the hares offered as one of many ※country sports§ by Scottish estates, the charity said. Its research found 25 companies offering mountain hare hunting online, eight of which were promoted by the Scottish Country Sports Tourism Group, which listed SNH and Visit Scotland as partner organisations.The report states: ※For almost half the year, from March to July inclusive, mountain hares are protected and any persecution without a licence from SNH is illegal. But, for the remainder of the year, they can be killed freely with no permissions and no transparency, and as such are persecuted on a large scale.§Driven hunts involved flushing hares towards a line of waiting guns. But hares were ※notoriously challenging to shoot§ as they were small and fast and the risk of causing injury rather than clean kills was heightened, it added. OneKind calls for a ban on hare killing, except under licence, and complete protection within national parks. "																																																			
" like flowers, bees like flowers. I like honey, bees like honey. I don＊t much like being out on cold, wet days, and neither do they. We＊re a match made in floral heaven. There have been times when I＊ve blundered through our relationship, but getting honeybees made a lot of sense 每 and changed my relationship with honey.It seemed the next logical step in growing your own. I also liked the idea of being in charge of so many. I can＊t have a herd of cows in the city, or fit even one goat in my space, but I could have 30,000 or so individuals to look after, get free honey and maybe make a few candles.It turns out all my preconceptions were wrong. You＊re never in charge of bees: at best, you tend to their world, but mostly they do their own thing. Honey isn＊t free: beekeeping has a price 每 the hive, the equipment 每 but the true price is how hard the bees work. (There＊s no beating around the bush: we  our honey from bees.) It＊s been a privilege to peer into my bees＊ world, one I shouldn＊t plunder, so last year I took just a 10th of their store, left them the rest and they came through winter on their own honey.Steve Benbow, who runs , is my bee mentor. We met at a book festival and it was another great match: he needed more flowers for his bees and I wanted to learn how to look after a hive. He gave me my first set of bees and built me a  to house them. In return, I helped him build a wildflower garden to feed his bees, and all the other pollinators, too.I am persevering with that top-bar hive, in which the bees make their own wax frames along thin, wooden bars. I do a bit of wax shepherding (bending wonky new wax so it sits straight on the bar), but the queen moves about as she pleases and there is minimal manipulation of the bees. Plus, top-bar hives are cheap and easy to make.My honeybees have also changed the way I garden. Once, I was mostly concerned with how humans perceived my space; now, I think of the insects foremost. For much of spring, my allotment was a beautiful sea of forget-me-nots. Wild flowers and weeds such as buttercups are hugely beneficial to pollinators, because they offer long-flowering periods of both nectar and pollen. Instead of managing my allotment largely by hoe, I now use shears, cutting and composting huge volumes of material to stop flowers setting seed, and rotting it down in buckets of water so my compost heap doesn＊t become too weedy.I＊ve never made so much compost and, in a lovely twist, each of my bins now has a large bumblebee nest in it. I went to fork one bin into the next and heard a roar: a nest of , If this means I have to wait until the end of the summer to tidy my compost, so be it. By autumn, the nest will be over: only the queen overwinters, and all the workers will die at the end of the year.Pollinators, be they honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees, wasps, butterflies, moths or flies, need both pollen and nectar. Pollen provides protein and nectar carbohydrates. Honeybees and some bumbles fly on warm days in winter, so require year-round food: not much, but winter-flowering shrubs and early spring bulbs can make a big difference. They also need a source of clean water and somewhere to nest. The water could be a pond, bird bath or water butt with a landing stage: marginal plants in a pond, sticks in a butt or bird bath.Your bees＊ nesting site could be a bee hotel but, as my compost heap attests, an undisturbed space works just as well: a dead hedge of sticks and twigs, say, or just a quiet corner. Being mindful not to clear up every last bit of dead material and leaf is as vital as any fancy hotel, though. If you do take the hotel route, position it somewhere sunny, facing south-east or south, and sheltered from rain.

"My great uncle came so late in his parents marriage that he was only one year older than his nephew (and my uncle) John. His parents were determined that he was to be their final child so they named him Omega George (, 10 July). For understandable reasons he always referred to himself as just plain George. Research by Refugee Action (, 10 July) resonates with our European Research Council-funded study of families and food poverty. In the UK we found that parents and children in families who had no recourse to public funds because of their immigration status were going hungry. Families who lacked access to benefits and employment were almost entirely reliant on charity, while their children were not entitled to free school meals and reported hunger and social isolation.

"Caterpillars turn into cannibals and eat each other when plants deploy defensive chemicals to make their foliage less appetising, research has revealed.While it was already known that caterpillars of many species munch on each other, and that plants have a range of defence mechanisms, it was not clear whether the two were linked. Now researchers say that a chemical commonly leaked from plants when damaged can trigger other plants to defend themselves by producing similarly unappealing substances, and that prompts the pests to turn on each other.※When the chips are down, eating another caterpillar may not be a bad decision [and] it turns out that the chips can be down if you find yourself on a plant that is heavily defended,§ said , an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a co-author of the research. Orrock and colleagues exposed 10 tomato plants each, to four different sprays. One contained only a detergent, while the others also included varying concentrations of methyl jasmonate 每 a substance given off by plants when damaged. Each plant was then exposed to eight beet armyworm caterpillars 每 a common pest in the US. Over eight days the team counted the number of animals, before weighing the above-ground plant matter.※The caterpillars really only have two choices 每 they can eat each other, or they can eat the plant,§ said Orrock.The results, published in the journal , reveal that after a week all but one or two survivors on each plant had been eaten regardless of which spray had been used, but the rate of cannibalism was very different. After 52 hours, about 7% of caterpillars were cannibalised on leaves sprayed with either no methyl jasmonate or the lowest concentration, while around 16% of caterpillars had been eaten on leaves sprayed with either of the more concentrated methyl jasmonate sprays.Most revealing was that more than five times as much plant matter was left on plants sprayed with the highest concentration of methyl jasmonate compared to those sprayed only with detergent 每 the latter were almost completely stripped of leaves.※From the plant defence perspective, making yourself so nasty that you are suddenly not the best thing on the menu works pretty well,§ said Orrock.※We know herbivores are sensitive to plant defences, we just didn＊t appreciate that one of the choices that plants might affect that herbivores make is the choice of eating another herbivore,§ he said.Nick Birch, an entomologist at the James Hutton Institute welcomed the research, but pointed out it was a small study and it wasn＊t clear that the findings would hold in agricultural conditions. ※It is quite difficult to extrapolate from those conditions to what would happen in a big field,§ he said.

This ※gap§ marks a straddle between Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, so maybe that＊s why. It＊s not new: there it is on the 1889 map, attached to a wedge of wood amid crackle-glaze fields.Where these meet the sky there is the slightest of rolls, enough to quell the disquiet of the absolute flat experienced further east. Isolated spinneys, trees and larger woodlands stand separate along the horizon. They＊re thick with summer, and watch like dark forts on rising fields of crop.I stop at the gap and walk into the field on the Cambridgeshire side. The air itches, the silence thick with heat. Crisp details: the purr of an investigating bee, the static-fizz of the pea crop, the twitch of things moving within it. Near the field＊s edge I watch a bird climb the inside of a hedge in silhouette, listen to its dainty movements, then walk over the gap into Northamptonshire, into the wood.Here humans have been. No moonshine (of course) but more modern rural mischief. A sign by the footpath asks no vehicles, please, and has been burnt for it. The path beyond: underfoot tyre track, hoof-hit and foot-fall mingle in a mess. Walking, I find deep trenches left by wheels, then dead tyres in the trenches, then foetid, buggy water in the holes where the dead tyres have been exhumed. Behind me on the remote, arch-cornered road I hear the sound of a fast car being driven too fast. And find stupid, strange litter: rugs, buckets, barrels.I try to enjoy it. A pheasant＊s bark; something heavy making a run to my left. And so many butterflies, meadow browns, everywhere. No mountains, no moonshine. But a gap between here and there.

"Thousands of people have taken to the streets of central London to protest against the start of Britain＊s grouse shooting season.Animal rights supporters are campaigning to end the sport, which would be their biggest breakthrough since MPs voted to ban fox hunting in 2004.Moorland estates across Scotland and northern England opened the annual red grouse-shooting season on Saturday, known as the Glorious Twelfth, the day after a wildlife expert said  in the Scottish Highlands and Uplands.Other animal rights events on Saturday included a protest ramble on Ilkley Moor where opponents of the last shoot taking place on public land believe they are on the cusp of victory.Speakers at the London event, including the BBC presenter Chris Packham, said the days of the West  shoot were numbered as Bradford faces unprecedented pressure not to review the lease next year.※I think that when people now see others killing for the psychopathic joy of it they are increasingly sickened and the reason for that is that our wildlife is running out,§ Packham said. He claimed public support for conservation in the UK had risen on the back of global outrage over the 2015 killing of Cecil the lion in South Africa and increasing use of social media.※It means that on Thursday, for example, the RSPB published video of marsh harriers being killed on a grouse moor in Yorkshire and within hours of that material going on to YouTube it has been spread all around. Everyone is instantaneously angered as it gets shared and there is frankly nowhere for these criminals to hide.§Clad in papier mach谷 fox heads and carrying banners for causes ranging from the campaign against badger culling to maintaining the fox hunting ban, marchers walked down Oxford Street to Whitehall.Danielle Flynn, 55, a former hunt saboteur from Glasgow, was marching with her daughter Karen, 24, who said: ※I think social media has been a big thing among my generation. A lot of them might be apathetic about politics but they might, for example, take an interest when I talk to them about animal testing and makeup.※I also tend not to like conflict and you have to be careful what you say to people these days, so the thing about a Facebook post or a YouTube video is that you can get your message across to people without having to confront them.§Jordan Psaros, 26, from Braintree, in Essex, said she had been considering voting for the Conservatives at the general election but had decided not to after learning of Theresa＊s May＊s support for a free vote on overturning the fox hunting ban.※I＊ve always been an animal lover but I basically became involved in this after I saw some videos online of foxes being killed by dogs set on them by hunters on horseback,§ she said. ※I think that a lot of people of my age are waking up to what is going on.§Animal rights supporters have been emboldened by the public reaction to recent controversies, including an outcry that forced the Arsenal football club owner Stan Kroenke to order his TV streaming service to stop showing big-game hunting, and the row over a photograph of 100 dead foxes that appeared on Vinnie Jones＊s Twitter feed.May＊s support for a free vote on overturning the hunting ban led some Tories to complain that it contributed to ※toxifying§ the party brand during the election. The focus group consultancy Britain Thinks found that while the ※dementia tax§ was key among older voters, fox hunting had an impact on swing voters, alienating many.Pro-hunting advocates have said it is impossible to say whether the animal rights movement is resurgent in terms of actual numbers, and that data suggests the public do not change their vote on the basis of hunting or shooting issues. They said a YouGov poll in May, which showed support for the ban at 67%, suggested an actual decline in support.※If there has been any genuine resurgence of animal rights activism, it can almost certainly be attributed to social media,§ said Liam Stokes, head of shooting at the Countryside Alliance.※Animal rights messages are very simplistic, and simplistic messages spread well on Twitter and Facebook, particularly when broadcast by celebrities like Packham and Brian May. The arguments for wildlife management are complex, nuanced and sometimes paradoxical, and don＊t lend themselves so easily to social media.§"																																																			
"The UK government is under growing pressure to introduce a money-back return scheme for plastic bottles, in order to tackle huge volumes of waste in a country where 400 bottles are sold every second.Opposition parties have called on ministers to introduce a deposit return scheme that  littering streets and seas around the UK. Similar schemes have been successfully introduced in at least a dozen countries.The idea has the backing of global drinks company Coca-Cola and comes amid warnings that the worldwide plastics binge poses as serious a threat as climate change. Sue Hayman, Labour＊s shadow environment secretary, urged the government to take swift action. ※A deposit return scheme would have widespread public support and would go a long way to ensuring that we recycle as much of our waste as possible,§ she said.Kate Parminter, environment spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said momentum was growing behind calls for a deposit return scheme. ※Earlier this year, Coca-Cola said to the Scottish parliament they would ,§ she said. ※Now that industry are backing this scheme, it is high time the UK government began to throw their weight behind it.§Last week, new figures obtained by the Guardian established that  and the number will jump another 20% by 2021.According to an unpublished parliamentary report, more than 4m plastic bottles a week could be prevented from littering streets and marine environments in Britain if authorities adopted the kind of deposit return schemes that operate in countries like Germany and Australia.The Conservative party＊s manifesto did not mention such a scheme in the run-up to last month＊s general election, but a spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the idea was being considered as part of a wider litter strategy launched in April.※We have made great progress in boosting recycling rates for plastic bottles, with their collection for recycling rising from less than 13,000 tonnes in 2000 to over 330,000 tonnes in 2015,§ the spokesman said. ※We are considering further the practical ways in which we can deal with the worst kinds of litter, including plastic bottles.§However, Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion and co-leader of the Green party, said ministers must do more.※The government is under growing pressure to take action on the plastic bottle crisis,§ she said. ※With such a slender majority in the House of Commons, and with the public swinging behind the campaign against plastic waste, there is a real chance that ministers will consider introducing a bottle deposit scheme.※For a government desperate to salvage its reputation, taking such a simple step forward isn＊t just the right thing to do 每 it serves their self-interest too.§In Scotland, support is growing for a deposit return scheme. Last week, the Scottish National party launched a detailed study into how such a scheme for bottles and cans would work.Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said: ※Clearly there are a number of issues for the Scottish government to consider when it comes to deposit return schemes, which can only be addressed by carrying out work to understand the design of a potential system.§ rates for plastic bottles in Britain stand at 59%, compared with more than 90% in countries that operate deposit return schemes, such as Germany, Norway and Sweden.Coca-Cola in Britain and Europe has  and now supports their adoption in the UK, after pressure from environment and anti-waste campaigners. ※We believe a new approach is needed,§ the company said in a report to the environmental audit committee before its inquiry into plastic bottles was dropped after the dissolution of parliament.※From our experiences in other countries, we believe a well-designed, industry-run drinks container deposit return scheme could help increase recycling and reduce littering,§ Coca-Cola added.Between 5m and 13m tonnes of plastic end up in the world＊s oceans each year, to be ingested by sea birds, fish and other organisms, and by 2050 the oceans will contain more plastic by weight than fish,  by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.Campaigners say plastic is polluting every natural system and an increasing number of organisms on the planet, with some of it already finding its way into the human food chain."																																																			
																																																			
"Today a life-sized ice sculpture of an African elephant will be placed in Union Square in Downtown Manhattan. Over the course of the day, this massive ice sculpture will gradually melt, symbolizing the alarming rate in which African elephants are continuing to disappear at the hands of poachers. The event is one of many being organised across the world on 12 August to celebrate World Elephant Day. It is part of the campaign  launched by Amarula Trust in partnership with the Kenyan NGO WildlifeDirect to raise global awareness of the plight of Africa＊s elephants. To reinforce the message, bottles of Amarula liqueur will be released for sale without the iconic elephant on the label. The trust will donate $1 for every bottle sold between now and the end of the year to support anti-poaching efforts.Initiatives like this are vital to focus the world＊s attention on elephants. Across Africa, it is estimated that one elephant is killed by poachers every 15 minutes. The global demand for ivory is still the principal driving force that is pushing elephants to the brink of extinction. As recently expressed by one of Kenya＊s foremost supporters of elephants, the First Lady of Kenya, Margaret Kenyatta, only a sustained global effort can save them:The event in Union Square is intended to highlight the critical role that America and other consuming countries have to play, both by reducing its own ivory consumption and by building pressure for a global ban on ivory trade.On an African level, poachers can only be defeated by adopting a continent-wide approach. Otherwise, when controls are tightened up in one country, poachers will simply relocate to neighbouring countries to continue their gruesome work. Anti-poaching efforts, like other actions to protect the environment, will have to be sustained on a timescale that is much longer than the election cycles in democratic countries. Elections are a reminder to defenders of wildlife of just how fragile our ＆victories＊ can turn out to be. Americans will not need to be reminded how, in just a few weeks, Donald Trump has not only reneged on the global climate change treaty but also set about dismantling domestic environmental protection measures that took decades to put in place.Here in Africa, it is not only the outcome but also the process of elections that gives cause for concern. All too often elections take place in a climate of uncertainty that allows unscrupulous people to plunder the natural environment, without fear of redress, with dire consequences for elephants and other wildlife. During the current election campaign in Kenya, armed invaders have , undoing years of patient wildlife conservation work. Not a single arrest has been made. African elephants are the largest terrestrial animal left on the planet. They live in close-knit families, and develop lasting friendships. They mourn their dead, meet up for reunions, and go to extraordinary lengths to protect other, young and vulnerable elephants from harm. To know elephants is to fall in love with them. It seems unthinkable that wild elephants should disappear. How can we make sure it doesn＊t happen?Care for the natural environment should be understood as a moral duty, as it was in the past by cultures with close bonds with nature. Our ancestors recognized springs, trees, animals, forests, reefs and caves as sacred and considered desecrating them to be a sin. Most people in the modern world are only dimly aware of how our destinies are intertwined with those of wild creatures and natural resources. But science has revealed that modern humans are no less dependent on the natural world than ＆primitive＊ societies. It has debunked the delusion of ＆human exceptionalism＊: the idea that humans can somehow escape the constraints that nature imposes on other species. Once we acknowledge that our natural heritage should be protected at all costs it is obvious that this truth should transcend politics and differences among political parties. Non-political organisations such as businesses and civil society organisations have a key role to play in maintaining this long-term vision in the face of political short-termism. In Africa, this understanding should inform our vision of national development. People in developed countries are rich in many ways. But visitors from developed countries who spend large amounts of money for a few moments in the company of elephants are searching for something that their societies, for all their material wealth, cannot provide. We in Africa have the opportunity to map out a different path. We can devise ways of creating wealth that leave our natural environment intact, as a continuing source of wonder and inspiration for future generations. Support for this vision came last month from an unlikely quarter. Speaking in Nairobi on his first visit to Africa, Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire, argued passionately that Africa should not try to be like China. The founder of the e-commerce giant Ali Baba might have been expected to argue that Africa should go for growth at any cost. Instead, he urged Africa to learn from the mistakes of developed economies and develop its own model of development, using technology to protect our unique wildlife and the environment: This statement from one of the world＊s most successful businessmen underlines what a terrible mistake it would be to allow development to destroy our natural heritage. It should also remind us that Africa has a unique role to play in solving global conservation challenges. This is one reason why the collaboration on World Elephant Day between two African organizations, Amarula and WildlifeDirect, is significant. We, as Africans, must be ready to assume responsibility for mobilising global support to protect our elephants and defeat the illegal wildlife trade.

", , and  each broke the global temperature record.  led by climate scientist Michael Mann just published in Geophysical Research Letters used climate model simulations to examine the odds that these records would have been set in a world with and without human-caused global warming. In model simulations without a human climate influence, the authors concluded:To put those numbers in perspective, you have about a one-in-3,000 (0.03%)  in your lifetime. You have about as much chance of being struck by lightning  as 2014, 2015, and 2016 each being as hot as they were due solely to natural effects. That means denying human-caused global warming is like planning to be struck by lightning three years in a row. Perhaps a tinfoil hat will help.On the other hand, in model simulations accounting for human-caused global warming, the odds of these events goes up substantially:It＊s unusual to have three consecutive record-breaking years even with the aid of global warming, but without the human climate influence, it simply wouldn＊t happen. These findings tie in to the , which climate scientists sent to the New York Times for fear that the Trump administration would censor or suppress the document. Previous drafts of the report were available to the public, although few take notice before the final version is published. Climate scientists worried that the administration would tamper with that final version. Among the report＊s conclusions:This conclusion is consistent with the latest IPCC report, which likewise . These conclusions are denied by many members of the Trump administration. For example, Trump＊s EPA administrator :Similarly, when Trump＊s Department of Energy secretary Rick Perry was confronted with the 100% human contribution to global warming since 1951, he responded by saying And of course the president himself , and didn＊t mention science once in his shameful speech declaring his intent to . Across the pond,  recently  that global temperatures have declined during the past 10 years. That, of course, is patently absurd considering the record-breaking temperatures we＊ve experienced over the past 3+ years. In fact, the short-term warming trend over the past 10 years is than the long-term trend. that the  made the ※ignorant and irresponsible§ decision to host a climate science denier.It＊s understandable that climate scientists would worry about the possibility that the Trump administration would censor their findings. Not only has the administration denied this politically-inconvenient science, but the Republican Party has a history of censoring climate science research.  just a decade ago. And the Trump administration has been  and .At the American Geophysical Union conference (the largest annual meeting of climate scientists) last December, climate scientists expressed fears about this type of censorship. . The scientists pledged to have learned the lessons of the Bush administration censorship, and not to allow the Trump administration to do the same. That＊s why the National Climate Assessment report was sent to the New York Times. This time, climate scientists are fighting back against censorship of their science.Unfortunately, scientific censorship is no longer our main concern. It was an effective strategy over a decade ago, when most people remained blissfully unaware of the threats posed by human-caused global warming. But since then, the issue has become politicized. As Trump and Pruitt and Perry have illustrated, denying basic climate science has become the political norm among Republican Party leaders. Simply put, it＊s possible that the Trump administration would have censored or suppressed the National Climate Assessment report, but even an uncensored report doesn＊t threaten them. The document mostly reiterates the findings of previous reports, like the last IPCC assessment. Political party leaders would just add it to the stack of documents and evidence whose inconvenient findings they deny.That＊s the problem we now face. It＊s not one that physical scientists can solve 每 at least not without the aid of social science research. We＊ve had enough evidence telling us about the need to act on climate change for decades. More evidence won＊t convince people; we now have to figure out the best ways to communicate it, as climate scientists like Katharine Hayhoe are learning:In the meantime, we＊re left wondering how many lightning strikes it will take to shock the climate science denial out of our system. We＊ve been struck by three in a row, yet the denial is still going strong."																																																			
"riving a silver or white car is good for the climate. A study a few years ago showed that the interiors of silver and white cars were cooler than black cars. That＊s because light colours reflect about 60% of sunlight and make the car＊s interior cooler. That in turn means it＊s less likely the car＊s air conditioner will be turned on, saving fuel and pollution.Scientists from  by leaving two Honda Civic cars, one silver and one black, in the sun, facing the same direction, for an hour, in Sacramento, California. Reporting in Applied Energy, they showed that the silver car＊s interior was about 5C to 6C cooler than the black car. They calculated that that represented an improved fuel economy of 0.44mpg, or 2%, and that, in turn, would cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1.9% and other exhaust pollutants by about 1%.That may sound a trifling improvement, but translated across the US an improvement of 2% in fuel economy in all cars and vans would save millions of gallons of fuel and corresponding CO emissions. In fact, light coloured cars could be built with smaller air conditioning units that use less fuel and still remain comfortable.It may seem amazing that something so simple as a car＊s colour could make much difference to cutting pollution, but the same principle of light colours has long been used for buildings. White roofs keep building interiors cool on hot days, and those cool roofs help cut the energy used for air conditioning as well as reduce the effect in cities."																																																			
"pening my washing machine at the end of a cycle is not something that generally fills me with excitement. But today it did, because doing so 每 I thought 每 would finally allow me to see and touch something I＊ve been reporting on for years: synthetic microfiber pollution from apparel.Instead, it illuminated something I already knew: my dog sheds a lot.Multiple studies have shown synthetic fibers to make up the lion＊s share of , and clothes made from synthetics (polyester, nylon, and so on) are widely implicated as the source of that pollution. Microfibers, as the name implies, are tiny, so they can easily move through sewage treatment plants. Unlike natural fibers, such as cotton or wool, synthetic fibers do not biodegrade, and tend to bind with molecules of harmful chemical pollutants found in wastewater, such as pesticides or flame retardants. Studies have shown health problems among , which then make their way up the food chain. Researchers have found high numbers of .But I had recently received the Guppy Friend, a fiber-catching  developed by Alexander Nolte and Oliver Spies, surfing buddies and co-owners of Langbrett, a German retailer that sells outdoor apparel. The bag is designed to reduce the amount of fiber shed by garments in the wash and catch those that are shed. So, I was excited because this bag is supposed to make this invisible pollution visible.I was relieved that my 15-year-old fleece jacket and month-old nylon leggings did not fill the bag with a mass of lint. But when I also discovered that only a teeny bit of fiber (and a lot of dog hair, each strand likely bigger than the microfibers found in waterways) in the bag after washing a bright blue Snuggie (hey, it was a gift), I became dubious about how effectively this device captures fibers. When I then dried the Snuggie (after removing it from the bag, which is used only in the washer) and pulled gobs of blue lint from the dryer trap, I felt those doubts were vindicated. The makers of Guppy Friend, however, tell me I should not compare the amount of fibers shed from items inside the bag, which they say is designed to reduce fiber loss, with that from the same items inside dryer. Either way, we need more than stop-gap measures such as Guppy Friend to prevent microfiber shedding. For that, apparel makers need to rethink textile production.Many people, myself included, feel overwhelmed and occasionally terrified by the impacts of climate change. . Sea-level rise. Collapsing fisheries. It＊s bad enough that plastic pollution is only adding to human-induced pressures on the oceans, but at least each consumer has the power to avoid single-use plastics, straws, and products that contain microbeads. Eliminating all synthetics from our wardrobes is a Herculean effort.Plus, clothing is intimate and nostalgic. I hang on to torn and frayed polypropylene base-layers because my memories of harrowing and awesome adventures are woven into them. I wear a ratty poly-blend sweatshirt I consider an heirloom. And when I wash these things, tiny fibers I can＊t see are jettisoned toward the sea. Some probably make it all the way there.Of course, scientists have really only started pulling on threads here 每 we have yet to understand how much harm these fibers cause in aquatic environments, nor what they might mean for human health. We know a great deal more about truly invisible pollutants, however.Take perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs). These have been used widely in manufacturing 每 including in . Two of the most widely studied PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), have been linked in epidemiological studies to multiple types of cancer in humans and other health impacts. PFCs are so ubiquitous they＊ve been detected in the blood of polar bears. And a new study found  used by 15 million Americans in 27 states.So, while scientists think the synthetic fibers shed from apparel are an environmental threat, they know that chemicals long used in apparel manufacturing are. That might cast those tiny fibers in a rather benign light, but that＊s not what scientists I＊ve interviewed think.Peter Ross, a senior scientist at the Vancouver Aquarium, has studied ocean pollution for 30 years, and is now launching a study to develop a protocol for tracing synthetic fibers found in the ocean back to their specific sources. He told me microfibers, and microplastics in general, play an important role in communicating environmental impacts: they are a kind of bridge between the very tangible and the utterly intangible.Because they are hard to see, these tiny pollutants make us look harder for, and think more about, the ways humans have shaped the environment."																																																			
"t is amazing that the Volkswagen and diesel emissions scandal was not discovered earlier. In 2003 nitrogen dioxide alongside London＊s Marylebone Road increased by around 20%. As we approached the 2010 legal compliance date, , not down, and diesel cars were shown to be much .However, according to the , no one suspected that any car manufacture was cheating. Instead it was thought to be a weakness in the test.Extra air pollution, over and above test figures, from  is thought to have produced 1,200 early deaths between 2008 and 2015. However, differences between real-world and official test emissions are not confined to VW. A recent French government investigation found only four out of 52 diesel cars met emission limits when used on the road, and half those in Dutch tests showed ※non-standard§ behaviour. These include reducing the pollution control after around 20 minutes (the official test duration) or when driving below the 20C test temperature. Car manufacturers claimed that these strategies are to prevent engine damage.We will have to wait until September 2019 before all new diesel cars are required to pass a real-world test. This has implications for proposed diesel scrappage schemes. In order for it to work, new cars have to be cleaner than the scrapped ones. To be really effective this means a petrol or electric replacement. Alternatively,  suggests, the scrappage grant could pay for mobility and not a new car; many years of car club membership, cycle hire or a public transport pass."																																																			
"Earth＊s last ice age ended about 12,000 years ago. The warmer and more stable climate that followed allowed for the development of agriculture and the rise of human civilization. This important period encompassing the past 12,000 years is referred to as . It also created a ※§ for climate scientists, because global temperatures simulated by climate models didn＊t match reconstructions from proxy data.To be specific, the overall temperature change during the Holocene matched pretty well in reconstructions and models, but the pattern didn＊t. The best proxy reconstruction from  led by Shaun Marcott estimated more warming than models from 12,000 to 7,000 years ago. Then over the past 7,000 years, Marcott＊s reconstruction estimated about 0.5∼C cooling while model simulations showed the planet warming by about the same amount.  led by Jonathan Baker may help to resolve that discrepancy. The scientists examined stalagmites from a cave in the southern Ural Mountains of Russia.  in the stalagmites can be used to estimate past winter temperatures. The Marcott study had one known shortcoming 每 the proxy temperature data they used mostly represented the summer season. And as Baker explained, changes in the Earth＊s orbital cycles have caused cooling in the northern hemisphere summer and winter warming during the Holocene:During the period from 15,000 to 7,000 years ago, temperatures were rising because large ice sheets were disappearing. That was especially true in the summer because back then, the Earth was closest to the sun during that season. So the Marcott temperature reconstruction, which was predominantly based on summer temperature proxies, estimated a lot of warming from 15,000 to 7,000 years ago (more than in model simulations), then a small cooling thereafter, while models simulate a slight warming over the past 7,000 years due to a slow rise in greenhouse gases.The stalagmite data in the Baker study show that winter temperatures behaved differently and can reconcile the discrepancies between the Marcott reconstruction and model simulations. This suggests that the climate models are right 每 Earth＊s surface temperature warmed rapidly at the end of the last ice age, from about 17,000 to 7,000 years ago, then the rate of warming slowed as the climate stabilized. However, it didn＊t reverse into a cooling trend, because atmospheric greenhouse gas levels were rising.Then of course came the Industrial Revolution 200 years ago, and carbon dioxide levels consequently shot up due to humans burning fossil fuels. As a result, temperatures have spiked as well. Over the past 130 years, global surface temperatures have risen about . Over the past 40 years, the rate of global warming has been 3 times faster yet. And that＊s in comparison to Earth＊s fastest natural climate change, when it＊s transitioning from an ice age to a warm period. Over the past 7,000 years, when human civilization was able to develop and thrive, Earth＊s temperatures and climate were quite stable. The temperature change during the past 7,000 years was about 0.5∼C. Humans have caused that much warming in just the past 25 years. If we follow through with the Paris agreement and manage to limit global warming to 2∼C over a 200-year period, in that best-case scenario the Earth would still warm 20 times faster than a natural ice age transition. If we fail to cut carbon pollution, that rate could speed to more than 50 times faster than Earth＊s fastest natural climate change.There are several important points we can take from the Baker study. First, climate models are able to simulate climate changes over the history of human civilization fairly accurately. Second, when there＊s a discrepancy between data and models, people have a tendency to distrust the models, but sometimes the problem lies more in the data. Third, if not for the human influence, the climate would continue the stable conditions of the past 7,000 years, during which time human civilization developed and thrived.Fourth and most importantly, humans are in the process of destabilizing the climate, and we＊re already causing global warming at a rate 20 times faster than Earth＊s fastest natural climate change. That＊s why climate scientists are so concerned, and why the Paris agreement is so important."																																																			
"Parents should use covers on their prams during the school run to protect their infants from air pollution, experts have warned.Scientists tested the pollution levels inside prams to assess the exposure of infants taken on the school run with older siblings. The researchers found that the fine particle pollution from vehicle exhausts, which is particularly harmful, was higher during the morning journey.※Young children are far more susceptible to pollution than adults, due to their immature and developing systems and lower body weight,§ said Dr Prashant Kumar, at the University of Surrey and who led the new research. ※These findings provide an insight for families who walk to and from nursery and primary schools with young children. Essentially, children could be at risk of breathing in some nasty and harmful chemical species.§※One of the simplest ways to combat this is to use a barrier between the in-pram children and the exhaust emissions, especially at pollution hotspots such as traffic intersections, so parents should use pram covers if at all possible,§ he said.The new study, published in the journal , placed detectors for particulate pollution in prams and made 64 journeys to and from schools in Guildford at drop-off and pick-up times. They found that air pollution spiked at road junctions and by bus stands, and that fine particle pollution was higher in the mornings, when the roads are busiest. ※Fine particles show larger health impacts compared to their larger counterparts and at the young age children are more susceptible to particulate pollution, suggesting a clear need for precautionary measures to limit their exposure during their transport along the busy roadsides,§ the researchers concluded.Previous work on whether adults are exposed to less pollution than children, who are closer to the level of exhaust pipes, has produced conflicting results. One study showed children were exposed to , while another found  of fine particles. The new work found no significant differences.Levels of particulate pollution in the UK are generally below legal limits, but  limits for fine particulate matter, and the WHO has urged the UK to do more to cut pollution. Earlier this week, the  each year as a result of air pollution.Particulate pollution is estimated to cause a total of 29,000 early deaths in adults each year in the UK. Levels of another key pollutant 每 nitrogen dioxide 每 are above legal levels in much of the UK. A recent study commissioned by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, showed .On Thursday, Khan announced the first of 12 ※low emission bus zones§, where only the cleanest buses will be allowed to run. The first is along Putney High Street, a , with others to follow including in .Khan, who said the zones represent the most extensive network of clean buses of any major world city, commented: ※London＊s toxic air is an outrage. [This] will make a big difference to the pollution caused by our public transport system.§Research published by Kumar＊s team in February showed that , when compared with those taking the underground or the bus. ※There is definitely an element of environmental injustice among those commuting in London, with those who create the most pollution having the least exposure to it,§ he said."																																																			
"wo crows fly into a tree towards the end of a long dreamy summer＊s day. They had been walking their beat on , through the flowering cocksfoot, lady＊s bedstraw, pyramidal orchids and whitlowgrass, hunting there as they have done every day for 15 years I know of. They now perch together as if watching the sunset, and so do I.In the same place doing the same thing, what can I know of the corvid mind? We know corvid intelligence is equal to that of primates. We know early people were intimately connected to the crow tribes and there are funerary relics from more than 5,000 years ago containing the bones of crows and ravens buried in this land. This belongs to ancient rituals that suggest a mutual trade in death; these were birds of omen long before they were thought of as vermin. As parties of rooks and jackdaws clatter about the sky, holding on to light, holding off from roosting as long as they can, I remember Thomas Hardy＊s line in Weathers: ※And rooks in families homeward go. And so do I.§ Where is that home we share with corvids? Is it the place we＊ve almost loved, half-feared and so persecuted them in for centuries? We know little of the crowscape they inhabit in our midst, we remember little of what they once meant; they remain a fifth column, a fourth estate, a third world, a second sight 每 stone the crows! This gathering of corvids is aplace of birds: a murder of crows, a train of jackdaws, a scold of jays, a tiding of magpies, a parliament of rooks, an unkindness of ravens. The collective noun occupies a space, a community. The culture and story of birds inhabits this place; a storytelling of crows? Birds verminous and ominous, persecuted and mythologised. Crow 每 like that evoked by the poet  每 is the great survivor: foolproof, climateproof, futureproof. In that shadowy way of knowing, a divination called corvidomancy, the future of our own existence in self-inflicted ecological turmoil may depend on reclaiming a corvid place in the human spirit and a human place in crow culture: a commonwealth of dark wonder."																																																			
"Tackling the  has been on of the themes of our special focus this week, . But in the short term, what about the symptoms? We examined some of the most common solutions to see if the claims they make are anything more than hot air.Despite looking deeply dystopian, surgeons＊ masks are an increasingly common sight in cities around the world 每 and largely pointless, according to , director of the UK＊s National Centre for Atmospheric Science. ※Surgical masks are pretty useless because air just leaks in around the side,§ Lewis says.As for more sophisticated anti-pollution masks? ※Others are designed to be far more airtight and do remove particles, but don＊t remove gases.  can pass right through.§ What＊s more, if the seal is good enough to keep small particles from leaking in, it may also require uncomfortable amounts of energy to suck air through the mask.※You can conceive of extremely elaborate devices that are closer to chemical-weapons gas masks,§ says Lewis, ※which would filter out gases and particles 每 it just depends what you＊re prepared to do.§ His hunch is that you＊d make more of an impact by changing your commuting pattern to avoid busy roads at peak times.Cooking can cause massive spikes in indoor air pollution, so ※extractor fans are a very good idea,§ says , professor of atmospheric science at University of Birmingham, ※as long as they＊re venting outside 每 and especially if you have a gas hob, because .§These come in all sizes 每 from take-out coffee cup to big industrial-looking drums. ※If you run a big blower with a fine particle filter on it,§ says Lewis, ※as long as your house isn＊t too leaky, it will make a meaningful difference to the particle numbers. The question regarding these products is: is the volume of air it＊s filtering significant relative to the volume of the house?§A home might cover hundreds of cubic metres, and in most houses the air is completely renewed every hour. ※If your unit is the size of a drinks can,§ asks Lewis, ※does it seem reasonable that it is going to make its way through tonnes of air?§A frequent complaint about the plug-in machines 每 which have become common domestic appliances in China 每 is their size. ※It＊s like having a rattling old air-conditioner,§ says Lewis ※it takes a lot of energy.§, director of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, has an even more fundamental problem with the growing adoption of personal purifiers. ※They are a short-term way for people to save their lungs but they do not solve air pollution problems 每 which also harm animals, agriculture and structures. People should not have to breathe through an air filter their entire life.§Consumers can＊t know how effectively their car filters the air they breathe. ※Cars are small, sealed boxes,§ says Lewis, ※but they are driven in the most polluted place there is: the middle of the road. Their filters have a tough job.§  As well as most particulates, filters in modern cars should catch noxious gases such as nitrogen dioxide with charcoal. But performance will vary and filters become less effective with use 每 so they need replacing around every six months.Filters should also work more efficiently, says MacKenzie, ※if you limit the air exchange between inside and outside, by switching to recirculation rather than continual fresh air. It＊s somewhat morally bankrupt, though, to be sitting in your luxury 4X4 with pristine air, churning out god knows what from your exhaust.§Air-purifying bus shelters and street furniture are being developed,  and others with , which turns gases into dust. It sounds like a good idea, but, says Lewis, ※you＊ve got to think about how big the atmosphere is over a city. Hundreds and hundreds of square kilometres, possibly 2km deep, so you＊ve got a massive swimming pool of pollution.§Unless the bus stop is enclosed, like a mini-waiting room, he says, ※the mixing of the atmosphere will completely outweigh the benefits you might get from blowing a bit of filtered air around.§Underground train networks face a similar issue: ※It isn＊t a sealed box that you can clean up. Every time a train goes through, it＊s like a piston replenishing the polluted air. You＊d need machines to move thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of tonnes of air per hour.§Lewis sees more gains to be had by cleaning the air in offices and other workplaces than on the streets. ※A modern office building is already very air-tight for energy efficiency,§ says Lewis, ※so you have the opportunity to filter the air because you＊re not replenishing it with polluted air from outside.§※In terms of air pollution mortality and morbidity, planting trees doesn＊t help very much at all,§ says Jacobson. ※Planting is more useful for absorbing carbon dioxide, which affects pollution indirectly through temperatures but not directly as a chemical air pollutant.§ (There are, of course, many other  to trees 每 although  warned that their leaves and branches slow air currents, causing pollutants to settle, and they may also act as sinks for particulates and chemicals.)Then again, perhaps we just haven＊t been doing it right? While bunging more trees along London＊s  probably won＊t touch the sides, the more leaves there are, the more fine particulates (), nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide will be removed from the air. ※You＊d need two man-made filters to achieve the same effect, which would increase the energy burden,§ says MacKenzie, who has a particular interest in how plants affect air.※The most useful places to put lots of vegetation are pedestrianised areas,§ he explains, ※because there＊s nothing there to make the air dirtier. Trees offer the advantage of closing off the area from polluted air above. And tall trees are helpful near motorways because they produce turbulence that helps traffic pollution disperse.§For heavily trafficked streets, says MacKenzie, ※green walls would appear, in theory, to be a better option than trees§ 每 since the plants up the side of a building can do their job without risk of trapping pollution at street level. Their success, however, will depend on many factors.※Green walls could help with pollution hotspots, but not with every hotspot 每 you have to do careful calculations,§ MacKenzie explains. ※It would require a lot of green vegetation, a lot of maintenance and careful, heavy implementing. So it might be an expensive solution.§Lewis co-authored an  last year, warning about the proliferation of unregulated, affordable air quality sensors. ※Smart§ sensors now even come with apps offering breakdowns of CO2, particulates and volatile organic compounds.※There is a significant challenge in making a decent measurement of air pollution with a cheap device,§ Lewis says. ※The sensors may be unreliable and they are marketed at the general public, who have no way of knowing whether they＊re working or not.§By contrast, he points out, air pollution monitoring equipment used by government organisations such as , or  ※typically costs tens of thousands of pounds. If we had a cheap way of doing it, we＊d do it the cheap way.§Lewis advises against making health decisions based upon personal monitor readings. The most accurate guide to air quality in your home is to keep track of your local outdoor readings and to keep a close eye on possible internal sources of pollution. ※If you＊re constantly frying in a wok or have an open fire, you will be making additional sources [of air pollution]. It＊s not rocket science, and you probably don＊t need a sensor to tell you that.§MacKenzie says he finds it bizarre that, for fans of domestic open fires, ※the smell is part of the attraction, when that＊s telling you it＊s a source of pollution§.If your carbon monoxide alarm goes off when you have a fire, you should assume there are other, significant pollutants in the room＊s air. ※However, the threshold on an alarm is set quite high,§ MacKenzie warns, ※because it＊s about whether you＊re going to fall asleep and never wake up again. If it doesn＊t go off, you might still have concentrations of carbon monoxide and other particles in your house.§Good ventilation, dry fuel and high temperatures are essential for clean burning, while swept and lined chimneys provide further protection. Even with so-called smokeless fuel, you need to take care. ※I＊d estimate that smokeless coal produces more nitrogen oxides than wood fuel,§ MacKenzie says, ※and they both produce the very small particles that are the least noticeable, but the most harmful, of the smoke particles.§"																																																			
"ngoing violence in the  (DRC) has taken a heavy toll on the country＊s women. Shocking levels of sexual violence have given the country a label as the ※most dangerous place to be a woman§. Civil strife, along with bushmeat hunting and human encroachment, also threatens its wildlife 每 especially gorillas, bonobos and chimpanzees.Bonobos have been vanishing rapidly from their only habitat 每 the DRC 每 for the past 20 years, according to the . Meanwhile, just 3,800 critically endangered  remain in their DRC homeland. Chimpanzees, found in 21 African countries including the DRC, are on the  as endangered.But now, women in the DRC are overcoming their own difficulties and coming to the rescue of Congo＊s great apes, with the assistance of international conservation organisations. The  (BCI), the  (Grace), the  (JGI) and an NGO called Coopera are working with local women to help advance great ape conservation through education, empowerment, access to health care and food security.One way to tackle great ape hunting is to provide alternative livelihoods for families 每 and especially women 每 living near key primate habitats.BCI helps women earn an income by funding pilot micro-credit projects to launch business enterprises such as soap and garment making. The organisation recently provided sewing machines and training to the Women＊s Association of Kokolopori and the Association of Rural Women of Djolu Territory. It is one of BCI＊s most successful initiatives, says Sally Jewell Coxe, its founder and president.※In the male-dominated Congolese society, women have traditionally not received as much access to education or employment as men,§ says Coxe. ※With the tools and opportunities to improve their livelihoods and generate income themselves, women gain a sense of ownership and empowerment.§Income-generating projects help reduce economic demands on families, including the need to gain income from hunting great apes for bushmeat and the wildlife trade, and can lead to a conservation ethic in local communities.Violence and instability during the second Congo war (1998-2003) created severe food insecurity in the DRC. People turned to bushmeat to survive and today, snares that are used to catch other animals also trap great apes.※Hunting is deeply ingrained in the history and culture of the people of the rainforest, and the commercial bushmeat trade offers one of the only reliable sources of income for many people,§ says Coxe. ※While we＊ve been successful at protecting bonobos in key areas of their habitat, reducing all hunting is a more difficult task.§Grace provides women and their families with alternatives to bushmeat by teaching them how to breed other protein sources. Participants earn an income by selling the meat, eggs and offspring of the animals they raise. The programme started with chickens and rabbits, but the women showed their economic and business acumen by making a switch to the locally common and often-eaten guinea pig, which are easier to breed.The programme is popular with local women like Kahindo Isesomo from Katoyo village. Guinea pig meat is ※a big source of protein to fight malnutrition in kids and adults§, she says . ※It is a source of income to the family to solve some little financial problems, which can be used to pay school fees.§BCI provides aid for courses and training in animal husbandry and pisciculture 每 the breeding and rearing of fish by artificial means 每 with local cooperatives and women＊s groups in and around the Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve and the Djolu Technical College, which was co-founded by BCI.Coopera is also helping to provide alternative food sources through Ecolo-Femmes, an amalgam of 10 women＊s associations, by training women in livestock breeding and agriculture. The organisation also aims to strengthen local socio-economic structures by providing alternative sources of income to dissuade men from hunting in nearby Kahuzi-Biega National Park.※Women run their homes and are in charge of their kids＊ education,§ says Lorena Aguirre Cadarso, country director of Coopera DRC. ※It is vital to change women＊s behaviours to change society. If [women] refuse to prepare bushmeat, their family will eventually stop consuming it.§Women also play a role in DRC＊s great ape infant surrogate programmes. Grace employs women as surrogate mothers during its initial 30-day quarantine period for newly arrived orphaned gorillas, often young, unweaned infants that need around-the-clock care. Caregivers sleep near the orphaned primates, take them out for forest explorations during the day, help feed them and aid the animals in healing from the traumatic loss of their forest homes and family groups.※Caring for these gorillas and nursing them back to health has been life-changing for the women,§ says Sonya Kahlenberg, executive director of Grace. ※In the Congo, so many terrible things have happened [to people]. We＊ve seen women working for us turn into gorilla moms.§※Women are important because they react towards baby orphaned gorillas as they do their own children,§ says Grace caregiver Aldegonde Saambili. ※The woman can also play an important role in conservation by advising her husband about the bad consequences of poaching.§Great ape caregivers are conservation ambassadors in their communities and are important leaders in local women＊s groups, says Kahlenberg.Surrogate mothers often make more conscious and sustainable use of natural resources and have improved their stewardship of the local environment, says Jackson Mbeke, centre director of Grace. ※They used to burn their fields and engage in other actions harmful to the environment, but they don＊t now. And they encourage other women in their community to do the same.Working with , a worldwide programme founded by primatologist Jane Goodall, Coopera empowers women and children in its mission to protect the environment and endangered species. The organisation engages young rape survivors in projects such as tree planting to provide food sources to wild chimpanzees.This plays a key role in their psychological recovery as they can integrate with other children from the community, says Itsaso Velez del Burgo Guinea, head of mission at Coopera DRC. ※They become nature＊s ambassadors.§The NGO also provides medical attention in rural areas, psychological support through individual or group therapy, and socio-economic reinsertion.※The kids are in the programme with us for three years minimum, so we can follow their development,§ says Cadarso. ※Parents explain how the girls change. They don＊t have nightmares, they have good marks at school, they are not fearful to go out of the house, they don＊t wet the bed, they play more with the neighbours.§As primary users of natural resources through farming and collecting wood and water, women must have a seat at the table in conservation, says Kahlenberg. ※Women have their finger on the pulse of their communities so they can advise on what conservation approaches will and will not work.§Grace brought female leaders together for a new women＊s group that acts as a support network, helps women encourage better environmental practices and is building fuel-efficient stoves in village homes.※Pressure on nearby gorilla habitats comes from people using the forest for their fuel needs,§ says Kahlenberg. ※We aim to halve wood and charcoal use by having women switch to stoves that burn more efficiently. This change would benefit gorilla habitat and [the health of] women and children, who are the most likely to be exposed to indoor smoke from inefficient cooking fires.§Women and children devote many hours each week to collecting and carrying firewood, so the efficient cook stove initiative could recoup time to be spent on other activities, including conservation.JGI＊s women＊s programmes 每 primarily in neighbouring Uganda and Tanzania 每 help keep girls in school through peer support networks, scholarship programmes and access to sanitary supplies.※One of the challenges we face when girls go through puberty, is that they will miss school because they＊re not equipped [with monthly sanitary supplies],§ says Shawn Sweeney, senior director of communications and engagement at JGI. In this region, girls may miss up to a third of a school year because of their periods.§The mentors identify girls who have dropped out of school and support their return, they distribute scholastic and sanitary supplies, give presentations and work closely with teachers. The organisation has trained more than 700 peer educators, reaching nearly 7,000 young students in Uganda and bringing around 600 girls back to school.Better-educated women translates into smaller family sizes, which in turn draw less on the surrounding forests and have fewer conflicts with great apes, says Sweeney. JGI plans to expand its work to the Congo pending funding availability.Pathfinding women 每 including primatologists Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey 每 have played an integral role in great ape protection for decades.※They set a precedent,§ says Coxe. ※Women have a certain affinity with the land and a disposition to care for it. Symbolically as well as practically, the woman＊s role is important in conservation.§"																																																			
"Donald Trump ※believes the climate is changing§ partly because of pollution, according to the US ambassador to the , Nikki Haley.Speaking on the CNN programme , due to air on Sunday, Haley was seeking to define the president＊s thinking about climate change in the wake of  that the US will leave the Paris climate accord, joining Syria and Nicaragua as one of three non-signatories. ※President Trump believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of that equation,§ she said. ＆So that is the fact. That is where we are.§The overwhelming majority of climate scientist believe human activity is the main driver behind the dangerous warming of the planet.Haley continued: ※He knows that it＊s changing and he knows the US has to be responsible for it and that is what we＊re going to do. Just because we got out of a club doesn＊t mean we don＊t care about the environment.§Trump＊s views on climate change have been at issue all week. On Thursday, in a White House briefing to explain the decision to pull out of the Paris agreement, officials refused to confirm or deny whether the president believed that global warming was caused by human activity. Pressed on the issue by reporters, one of them said ※can we stay on topic, please§.White House spokesman Sean Spicer said earlier in the week he did not know the president＊s views. ※Honestly, I haven＊t asked him that,§ he said. ※I can get back to you.§On Friday, after Trump＊s announcement on the Paris accord departure, Spicer was asked the same question.※I have not had the opportunity to specifically talk to the president about that,§ he said.Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax,  in 2012 saying it was a concept ※created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive§.Questioned on CNN about the decision to pull out of the Paris accord, Haley said: ※We have got a president who is going to look out for the environment. It＊s what we do. Its who we are. We are going to continue to be a leader in the environment. ※The rest of the world wanted to tell us how to do it and we＊re saying we will do it, but we will do it under our terms.§ She later acknowledged that the US set its own emissions targets under the Paris agreement, which is voluntary and non-binding, but blamed the Obama administration for setting goals that were not attainable. In the excerpts of the interview released on Saturday, Haley did not explain why the US did not stay inside the accord and amend US targets. "																																																			
"or precious decades experts have explained, over and over, that the science of climate change is incontrovertible, the consequences of blindly sticking with fossil fuels catastrophic and the costs of inaction far higher than switching to a low-emissions economy.But these facts had no impact on the sceptics, who cling to a worldview where they find ※alternative facts§, where fossil fuel power is the only path to prosperity and mounting environmental and economic evidence to the contrary is some kind of dastardly leftwing plot. For Tony Abbott＊s economic adviser Maurice Newman,  in opposition to ※capitalism and freedom§. To Donald Trump it is a ※hoax§ propagated by the Chinese to undermine the US while the rest of the world rolls around laughing.The only skerrick of positive news from sceptics＊ greatest victory yet 每  每 is that it seems to have galvanised politicians, scientists, business leaders and economists who have grown weary from all these years talking to the hand. Because now it is clearer than ever that the economic interests Trump claims to defend can only be served by acting on global warming. It is way past time to speak some more loud, blunt truth to arguments this stupid.To make the ridiculous case that abandoning Paris was good for the US economy, Trump didn＊t just have to ignore science, but also the pleading of the US business community he was purporting to defend 每 , and the  who have attacked his decision, including the chief executives of Tesla, Goldman Sachs and Disney and companies including Nike, BP, IBM, Apple, Google, Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Adobe, Morgan Stanley, Unilever and Mars.The truth is, he has  that renewable energy jobs in the US are booming and . The contentious  he advanced to make his case for abandoning Paris came  which made some  to reach its conclusions, including that it would ※not take into account potential benefits from avoided emissions§.The real-world evidence is very different. As the director of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, : ※The increase in employment in solar energy alone over the past three years is more than twice the total number of jobs in the coalmining industry in the United States .§Meanwhile in Australia, the mind-numbing years of climate ※war§ have ground us to a policy paralysis. dare not make a decisive move lest he startle the sceptics and fossil fuel advocates still lurking in his own party ranks (like the visionary Craig Kelly, chair of the Coalition＊s environment committee, who tweeted he had ※champagne on ice§ in preparation for the Trump announcement, then celebrated it by declaring: ※There is a more efficient way to generate energy than using fossil fuels, it＊s just that mankind hasn＊t yet worked it out yet§).And so the government continues its zigzag trajectory 每 quietly searching for a viable policy while periodically veering back to mouth some nonsense to calm the conservatives. It has reaffirmed its backing for the Paris agreement but still has no policy to meet its commitments and has rejected, , some of the best options available to the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, who has been charged with finding something resembling a solution. Turnbull talks with real enthusiasm about the manifold possibilities of renewable power and pumped hydro storage, but then his treasurer . The government carefully floats the idea of a low-emissions energy target 每 not dissimilar to the existing renewable energy target, which could be reasonable policy but could also be risible if the emissions benchmarks allow it to cover what the minerals＊ industry PR likes to refer to as ※low-emissions§ coal-fired power without insisting its emissions be captured and stored.It claims to understand the maths of the climate threat confronting the world and then (like  Labor) considers massive taxpayer subsidies to help the enormous new Adani coalmine that would, on its own, contribute 0.5% of all the carbon that can be emitted before the globe exceeds 2C warming when its coal is burned.Like Trump, politicians tout the Queensland mine as a provider of regional jobs, ※tens of thousands§ of them, they say, again and again. But to believe that you have to ignore Adani＊s own expert witness, who admitted in court the actual jobs figure  To accept the project＊s commercial viability you have to ignore the assessment of the biggest Australian banks,  每 or, if you are the resources minister, Matt Canavan, even try to  for reaching that commercial conclusion. And to argue this is the best use of a taxpayer subsidy you have to close your eyes to the many thousands of actual jobs governments are, or could be, supporting in the renewable industry in the same general region, projects such as the Whitsunday solar farm, the Longreach solar farm, the Kidston solar farm, the Collinsville solar power station To insist that coal will play a long-term part in Australia＊s new energy generation you have to wilfully ignore the reality of the targets we＊ve set ourselves, the ones we say we will stick to, and the plummeting costs of renewables such as solar and wind. The truth is, we really cannot walk both sides of this street. We＊re either on the side of Trump and his sceptics, or on the side of the facts."																																																			
"rom the telegraph wires laid across the Atlantic in the 1860s to the fibre optic wires carrying digital data today, our oceans are criss-crossed with lines used for  (pdf). But when technology is superseded or a company ceases to trade, what happens to the cables and their copper, aluminium, steel and plastic?Some companies upgrade the cable to make it fit for purpose, others can reuse it (and its accompanying repeater devices, which help transmit signals). It can also be recycled into raw material for industry.Despite this, Arne de Jong, a Dutch ship captain who co-founded cable recovery company , estimates 94% of unused cables and 72,000 repeaters are abandoned on the seabed, containing materials worth billions of dollars. CRS Holland has been  for a Dell Circular Economy People＊s Choice Award for addressing this deep-sea challenge.※It is like the Wild West in the middle of the ocean,§ says de Jong. ※There＊s no police or authority that can control it. There are millions of kilometres of cables on that ocean floor.§ De Jong believes this cable is a precious resource that can yield valuable materials for re-use, stressing that cable recovery is not a cowboy activity but done on behalf of clients who own the cable. Since 2009 his vessel has reeled in almost 20,000km of defunct cable, worth 每 he reckons 每 some $27m (?22m).CRS isn＊t the only one to realise the value of this cable 每 sometimes pristine and worth almost as much as new. From France-based Orange Marine to South African Mertech Marine, a host of other firms are similarly busy, not least to help meet demand from developing countries that can＊t necessarily afford new cabling.Nicole Starosielski, author of The Undersea Network, points out that pulling up old cables can be costly, particularly if newer ones are damaged in the process. However, she agrees that reusing older cables can be a tremendous asset, particularly in places where it wouldn＊t be economically feasible to lay a new system. Any state can lay submarine cables on the international waters under the United Nations convention on the . While current cable operators have licences, nobody is apparently responsible 每 for example 每 for defunct telegraph cables from long-gone companies.Peter Jamieson, chairman of the European Subsea Cables Association, an association of cable owners, operators and suppliers, says decommissioned cables are dealt with on a case by case basis, depending on issues including licence conditions in territorial waters, environmental impact of removal and whether they can be reused. ※Any cables not recovered remain the liability of the cable owner,§ he adds.Recovering and recycling cables lying in deep water, often outside national jurisdiction where most cable recovery takes place, does not have a significant impact on the environment, according to Keith Schofield, general manager of non-profit industry body the International Cable Protection Committee. In contrast, he says, the peer-reviewed evidence suggests it is environmentally best not to disturb the seabed in shallow water.Brian Bett, a deep-sea biologist from the National Oceanography Centre, adds that cables probably make little difference to deep ocean life. ※They have a tiny to zero impact,§ he says. ※But there could be a carbon footprint assessment of the diesel fuel used to recover them.§"																																																			
"The rogue practice of removing vital pollution filters from the exhausts of diesel vehicles has suffered a blow with the  (ASA) for the first time banning an advert for the service.However the number of filterless cars on UK roads, pumping out high levels of toxic particles, remains unknown and air pollution campaigners say the government must investigate and then crack down on the shady practice.Particulate pollution causes almost , costing ?15bn in health costs.  (DPFs) have been compulsory in new diesel cars since 2009 but can become clogged and cause breakdowns, particularly for city drivers.Replacing DPFs usually costs more than a ?1,000 and, as a result, many garages across the country offer to remove the filter completely for a few hundred pounds. They exploit a legal loophole which means removing a DPF is not an offence, only driving the car afterwards on a public road. Without the filter, particulate emissions are likely to soar fivefold.Friends of the Earth complained to the ASA about an online advert from a garage in Bristol which offered to remove DPFs. The advert said: ※The only MOT regulation regarding the DPF is a simple visual inspection. As long as the DPF still appears to be fitted, the vehicle will pass the MOT visual inspection. Therefore we only remove the internal core, leaving the outer casing in place. The vehicle will appear to have a DPF fitted and will appear unmodified.§A qualification was included at the bottom of the advert which stated ※*Our DPF Removal service is sold for off-road use only§. However, the ASA concluded on Wednesday that this ※was not sufficiently prominent to counter the overall impression that vehicles which had their DPF removed could be used on public roads§ and banned the advert as misleading. Any future adverts must make ※immediately clear with sufficient prominence that it is illegal to drive such vehicles on a public road§, the watchdog said.In 2014, ministers said the  and introduced a visual check into the MOT. The . But with some garages promising ※invisible§ DPF removal to beat the MOT test, as in the case of the banned advert, the true number of filterless vehicles is likely to be much higher.※The more we uncover about diesel vehicles, the dodgier they seem,§ said Aaron Kiely, at Friends of the Earth. ※Removal of pollution filters 每 which are designed to reduce dangerous emissions and protect people＊s health 每 should clearly be illegal. The Department for Transport must also investigate the full scale of this problem and clamp down on those who are putting people＊s lives at risk.§A spokesman for the Department for Transport (DfT) said: ※The government is firmly committed to improving the UK＊s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. Changes to the MOT test were implemented in 2014 to ensure that particulate filters are fitted where necessary and if not then the vehicle would fail the test.§※Alternative methods of detecting the removal or effectiveness of particulate filters are under development and we are examining their suitability for use in an MOT,§ said DfT spokesman: ※Further research is required to ensure potential methods accurately determine a pass or fail.§Almost all diesel cars have also been revealed as  than official limits. NO2 levels are  and calls are rising to ban dirty diesel vehicles from British city centres, as  have already pledged.In May, the Guardian also revealed that  offering to remove DPFs."																																																			
																																																			
"The death of the Great Barrier Reef is one of the ※great tragedies of our lives§, US senator John McCain has said, arguing America should uphold its commitment to the , or accede to it with minor modifications.Speaking in Sydney on Tuesday night, the veteran politician and former Republican party presidential candidate said climate change was undeniably real and that it was incumbent upon world leaders to act now to halt and reverse global warming.※I think that climate change is real. I think that one of the great tragedies of our lives is the  dying [and] the environmental consequences of that,§ he said.The position of the world＊s second-largest carbon emitter on the Paris climate change agreement is uncertain and a subject of global speculation. US commitment to reducing emissions or otherwise could have significant ramifications for other countries upholding their promised reductions.Donald Trump has said he will announce this week whether the US will uphold the Paris carbon reduction commitments it agreed to in 2015, under his predecessor Barack Obama.McCain said he wanted to see America remain in the Paris accord. ※I would like to see us ... either accept the agreements as were made by the Obama administration or suggest modifications which would make it palatable for us and acceptable to us to join.※If we don＊t address this issue, I am very much afraid about what the world is going to look like for our children and grandchildren.§Climate change caused unprecedented back-to-back mass bleaching events in  and  on the Great Barrier Reef, killing .The federal and Queensland＊s governments＊ two-year-old plan  is reportedly already redundant because the impacts of climate change are far more severe than predicted.Recent surveys have found bleaching is significantly worse than predicted, with  of shallow-water coral north of Port Douglas killed last year.McCain was in Australia as a guest of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. In a wide-ranging speech he conceded that the Trump administration was mired in scandal, but US as it navigated troubled times.He said America＊s reputation had suffered in the early months of Trump＊s presidency as scandals over ties to Russia, nepotism, FBI investigations and foundering relations with other world leaders have rocked the administration with crippling consistency.※We are going through a rough period,§ McCain said. ※We really are, and for me to tell you that we aren＊t, politically, is not fair. But we＊ve gone through other troubled times. I can remember Watergate scandal and how it brought down a president. I＊m not suggesting that＊s going to happen to this president, but we are in a scandal, and every few drops another shoe drops from this centipede, and we＊ve got to get through that.§McCain said observers of the US must look beyond the president.※Our foreign friends always tend to focus on the person in the White House. But America is far bigger than that. America is our courts of justice. America is our state and local governments. America is our Congress.§"																																																			
"very morning before the sun rises, Stella Ampofo, a 25-year-old single mother of two boys, frantically gathers her belongings and sets off for work to beat the morning traffic in Ghana＊s capital, Accra. If she doesn＊t leave before daybreak, congestion during rush hour could extend her 40-minute journey from Accra＊s suburbs towards downtown to three or four hours. ※I＊m in trouble if I leave my house around 6 or 6.30am,§ Ampofo says. ※I then won＊t arrive at work until nine or 10am, and that creates a lot of problems with my manager because I＊m supposed to get there by eight. If the government doesn＊t do anything about the traffic, it＊s not going to get any easier ＃§ To ensure a punctual arrival, Ampofo, a seamstress at a manufacturing centre that converts plastic waste into reusable products, leaves her home at 4am every day and begins work an hour later 每 just as the road traffic starts to build up, as roughly 2 million daily commuters converge on the central business district in downtown Accra.Clouds of black exhaust fumes hover over the heads of impatient motorists. Cab drivers blast their horns, while pedestrians scurry on to rickety commercialised minibuses 每 referred to as ※§ by locals 每 that carry up to two-dozen passengers squeezed tightly together. Only motorcyclists who can skilfully manoeuvre between lanes are able to bypass the congestion.Although gridlock typically  billions of dollars annually, insufficient data in developing countries makes it difficult to assess the economic impact on cities such as Accra. A recent  measuring the cost of air pollution globally, however, provides some insight into how congestion affects people＊s health. Gridlock causes longer travel times, which increases fuel use and emissions. In 2013, a total of 17,524 Ghanaians died from air pollution, a 107% increase from 1990. ※Accra has struggled with the management of the mobility challenges and rising traffic congestion on almost all arterial routes to the central business district,§ Lawrence Kumi, director of research, statistics and information management at Ghana＊s Ministry of Transport, admits in an email. ※The implementation of various remedial measures was on an ad-hoc basis and not well coordinated. There was the need for a holistic approach.§In 2014, the government of Ghana began developing a plan to reduce congestion and overhaul the urban transportation system in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (Gama), which includes Accra and its outskirts. The plan was in collaboration with the Korea International Cooperation Agency (Koica), and supported by  from the South Korean government.Before the end of this year, the final transport master plan (TMP) is due to be presented to Ghana＊s ministry of transport for implementation. The plan seeks to ※bring together all modes of transport ＃ not only by road§ and ※reduce traffic congestion and logistic costs§ over the next 20 years.Greater Accra＊s current population of around 4.3 million is predicted to almost double by 2035 每 likewise the number of vehicles on the roads. While increased congestion can reflect a city＊s growing economic vitality, the potential negative effects 每 low worker productivity, hours-long delays, more dangerous roads, commuter stress, pressure on road infrastructure and an unhealthy intake of  每 will place a serious strain on the city if it is not addressed soon.Accra is not alone in facing transportation challenges. Nearby Lagos, the economic capital of Nigeria, is  for being one of the most gridlocked cities in the world. But its population is around five times Accra＊s, and its economy greater than the whole of Ghana 每 so according to Kweku Amoasi, associate director for transport planning at the London-based engineering consultancy , Accra should have no excuse when it comes to severe congestion.※With a small population,  should be able to manage traffic much better,§ Amoasi says. ※There＊s just been a total lack of foresight. The planners should sit down and realise they＊re not doing this for themselves; they＊re doing it for the nation.§ Bernard Abeiku Arthur, a senior urban specialist with Belgium-based , says it is this kind of regulatory neglect that has led to today＊s unabating traffic troubles and dysfunctional transport system in Accra. ※We knew the population was growing,§ Arthur says. ※We knew we were getting urbanised, but we ignored all the necessary ingredients and elements for planning our urban space properly.§Arthur says the new TMP is ※very fanciful§ on paper, but also too limiting geographically 每 excluding regions beyond Greater Accra from which much of the traffic originates. ※The urban area is impacted by the fringes,§ Arthur said. ※So if you＊re doing your calculation and you cut out the fringes, you might not be doing a very good calculation.§ Francis Akakpo, programme officer at Koica in Ghana, says the planners were unable to conduct research on areas beyond the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area because of ※limited time and resources§. Ghana＊s first mass transit bus system, Omnibus Services Authority, was established in 1927 during the British colonial period. After independence, public transportation remained largely state-owned until the late 1980s and early 90s, when the government divested itself of assets amid financial mismanagement. This was when the privately run buses appeared to fill the gap: the , a significant contributor to congestion, has been the most common mode of mass transportation ever since. In September, however, the Greater Accra Passenger Transport Executive launched a pilot run of a new Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system,unleashing city buses across several major routes throughout Greater Accra. In defiance of Ghana president John Mahama＊s claims that this marked the beginning of a new modern public transport networkfor the city,  operators and other commercial drivers threatened to strike over fears the new buses would force them out of operation. The final TMP proposes building on the city＊s new bus network byreplacing thousands of  with high-capacity buses that promise to be safer, faster and more comfortable 每 a move that looks set to increase tensions with the existing transport providers. These buses will only be released ※on a gradual, incremental basis, to make room for adoption and acceptance§, says Koica＊s Francis Akakpo.But according to Abeiku from Cities Alliance, even a successful implementation of the public bus system will only provide minimal relief to congestion. For sustainable long-term improvements, he says, planners must commit to focusing on rail, tram and subway developments so commuters like Stella Ampofo aren＊t forced to upend their daily lives just to get to work.  ※We have to envision what kind of city we want Accra to be,§ Abeiku says. ※Do we want a city that supports its economy, whose people feel free to move around? A city where public transportation is properly regulated? That is the kind of city I want.§"																																																			
"Under a dual onslaught of global warming and localised urban heating, some of the world＊s cities may be as much as 8C (14.4F) warmer by 2100, researchers have warned.Such a temperature spike would have dire consequences for the health of city-dwellers, rob companies and industries of able workers, and put pressure on already strained natural resources such as water.The projection is based on the worst-case scenario assumption that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise throughout the 21st century.The top quarter of most populated cities, in this scenario, could see temperatures rise 7C or more by century＊s end, said a study in the journal Nature Climate Change. For some nearly 5C of the total would be attributed to average global warming.The rest would be due to the so-called ※urban heat island§ effect, which occurs when parks, dams and lakes, which have a cooling effect, are replaced by concrete and asphalt 每 making cities warmer than their surrounds, the researchers said.※The top 5% [of cities by population] could see increases in temperatures of about 8C and larger,§ study co-author Francisco Estrada of the Institute for Environmental Studies in the Netherlands said.Estrada and a team used different projections of average planetary warming, combined with the UHI effect and potential harms, to estimate the future costs of warming on cities.The median city, right in the middle of the range, stands to lose between 1.4% and 1.7% of GDP per year by 2050 and between 2.3% and 5.6% by 2100, they conclude.※For the worst-off city, losses could reach up to 10.9% of GDP by 2100,§ wrote the team.UHI ※significantly§ increased city temperatures and economic losses from global warming, they added.This meant that local actions to reduce UHI 每 such as planting more trees or cooling roofs and pavements 每 could make a big difference in limiting warming and minimising costs.Cities cover only about 1% of earth＊s surface but produce about 80% of gross world product and account for around 78% of energy consumed worldwide, say the researchers.They produce more than 60% of global carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal, oil and gas for fuel.The world＊s nations agreed in Paris in 2015 to the goal of limiting average global warming to two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial revolution levels by curbing greenhouse gas levels in the Earth＊s atmosphere.For the latest study researchers used data from the world＊s 1,692 largest cities for the period 1950 to 2015."																																																			
"That the government is now at last being forced to do more to reduce the dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution is welcome news (, 3 November). More than a year on from the ※dieselgate§ revelations, ministers should have been in no doubt about the dishonest and illegal methods used by some manufacturers to cheat emissions tests. Not only has the government failed to update its pollution modelling based on realistic emissions figures, it has also done nothing to support the 1.2?million UK diesel vehicle owners caught up in this scandal.If anything, the government seems to be going out of its way to protect manufacturers. Cars fitted with the defeat device software are still able to pass MOT emissions tests, so the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency seems to have turned a blind eye to this.Compare this with the situation in the US, where the Environmental Protection Agency has successfully prosecuted VW and arranged for diesel owners to be compensated. In the UK, it seems, Defra does nothing. Successful prosecution here would send a clear message to all manufacturers to be honest with their emissions and fuel economy figures. In addition, the introduction of on-the-road testing, rather than the static lab testing presently used, would provide more reliable figures., Your  (9 November) is right to call on government to address the UK＊s dangerous problem of air pollution by reprioritising greener transport, but failed to mention in its proposed solutions the most environmentally friendly and cost effective modes of all: cycling and walking.Cycling＊s bang for its buck outstrips every other mode of transport, with conservative Department for Transport estimates showing that for every pound spent, the economy takes five back, particularly in terms of health and reduced congestion. We still await the government＊s promised  which currently allocates just 72p per person for cycling and walking in 2021. Our level of investment in motorways and A-roads at the same time will be ?84 a head. If government wants to make a real difference to cleaning our air, then let＊s rebalance this spend, and give everyone the opportunity to choose cycling for shorter every day journeys. George Monbiot (, 9 November) is right that air pollution is a public health emergency. Yet our local council still proposes to build hundreds of homes on the wrong side of our town for commuter travel, thus putting up to a thousand extra cars on the streets of a medieval town. This is despite declaring an  across the whole town and despite its own highways assessments that predict an average 350% increase in traffic queues at peak times. It seems that no health emergency is severe enough to stop relentless development in the face of all the evidence. When the revised plan goes to the Planning Inspectorate we will see how seriously the government takes this issue. George Monbiot is right to draw attention to the need to reduce pollution from traffic. However, what he may not realise is that this is being used as a smokescreen to distract attention from the much more serious issue of indoor air pollution. According to the World  Organisation and many other scientific bodies, hazardous chemicals found in indoor air are at least five times more damaging to health than external air pollution.The government has told its committee on the medical effects of air pollutants to ignore internal air and concentrate on external. This means that the occupants of increasingly airtight buildings are at risk of asthma, respiratory problems and cancer from breathing in dangerous chemicals emitted inside buildings. George Monbiot underestimates the damage to our communities from the motor car. Where roads are safe and children can play out in them as they have done for countless generations, then parents talk to each other and speak of ※keeping an eye out for each other＊s children§. The damage to feelings of community means that the neighbourhood feels full of strangers rather than friends and acquaintances. This explains the exponential rise in fear of ※stranger danger§ which has no basis in evidence. Children＊s loss of freedom to play outside results in lack of exercise and consequential obesity. Once again George Monbiot tells us what we need to 每 but often would rather not 每 hear. The car has given as many problems as solutions for mankind. And as regards the freedom it brings us, it comes in inverse proportion to that of other people, both locally and globally. When John Prescott as transport minister imposed the same duty on biodiesel as on ordinary diesel he stopped the development of the biodiesel industry. If you want to improve air quality in London and our other major cities quickly and effectively, cut the duty on biodiesel . Coach operators road hauliers and private motorists would all start using biodiesel again. Biodiesel does not contain the same harmful particulates one finds in ordinary diesel. If one stands on Highgate Hill and looks out across London one can see a cloud of smog over the city as if London was sitting in a bowl. Londoners are breathing that air. When I visit London after a day or so, if I wipe my nose, I find soot on my handkerchief. George Monbiot＊s article on cars and pollution never mentioned the important role of free bus passes . My wife and I use our passes when ever we can , rather than our own transport. We have a small campervan that is our only transport. I believe that bus passes are an important way to cut back on car use, I always feel that we are making a sound evironmental choice. When visiting cities we use park and rides, or else purchase cheap rail tickets on line. We are both concerned about climate change, always looking for ways in which we can make a difference. Every little counts is my belief."																																																			
"Tiny pieces of plastic in personal beauty products, that end up in the oceans and are swallowed by marine life, will be banned from sale in the UK by the end of 2017, the government is to announce on Saturday.The move comes just days after , and sees the UK following in the footsteps of the US, . More than 357,000 people signed  calling for a UK ban, and environment groups welcomed the news of the ban.Microbeads are very small pieces of plastic in products such as facial scrubs and makeup. Some are visible to the naked eye, but others are as tiny as one micrometre. Conservationists have warned that they can affect fish growth and persist in the guts of mussels and fish that mistake them for food.The industry had argued that it was already phasing them out voluntarily, but critics have claimed some companies  or dragging their feet on a phase-out.Greenpeace said the new ban was welcome but should be extended to other products too.※It＊s a credit to Theresa May＊s government that they＊ve listened to concerns from the public, scientists, and MPs and taken a first step towards banning microbeads,§ said the group＊s oceans campaigner Louise Edge. ※But marine life doesn＊t distinguish between plastic from a face wash and plastic from a washing detergent, so it makes no sense for this ban to be limited to some products and not others, as is currently proposed.§The Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association, which represents the industry, said it was not surprised by the ban, but did not understand why it had been singled out, given other plastic rubbish dumped in the oceans.Dr Chris Flower, its spokesman and director general, said: ※It was inevitable. But it will ban something we are not using. The survey we＊ve carried out [on members] shows a 70% reduction [in products with microbeads] since 2015, and almost zero by the end of 2018.§He said it would not increase costs to consumers, but did mean some health and beauty products would disappear from shelves, as manufacturers work to overcome ※supply, quality and reliability and microbiological purity issues§. The environment minister, George Eustice,  that the government ※fully backed§ a ban and that costs to industry would ※not be that high§.The government is to publish a consultation next week on how wide-ranging the ban should be, and which products will be covered. Keith Taylor, the Green party MEP, welcomed the ban but  it should extend much further than just beauty cosmetics.Mary Creagh, the Labour MP and chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, agreed, saying: ※I＊m pleased to see the Government has finally agreed with my Committee＊s call for a ban on microbeads. Fish don＊t care where the plastic they are eating comes from, so it＊s vital the ban covers all microplastics in all down the drain products.§The US ban, approved by Barack Obama, covers cosmetic products with plastic microbeads, including toothpaste, soap and body washes.One cleansing product can contain hundreds of thousands of the microbeads, which end up in the oceans after being washed down sinks. Yet natural alternatives that biodegrade and pose no harm to marine life exist, including jojoba beads, apricot kernels, ground nutshells and salt.Supermarket beauty products such as those by Asda, Waitrose and Sainsbury＊s have already had the plastic dropped, and major companies such as Unilever 每 which owns Dove and other brands 每 have also phased them out. But other big names such as Tesco will not have phased them out entirely until the end of 2017. Procter and Gamble, which owns Crest toothpaste, Gillette, Olay, will have ended them by 2017.Consumers looking to avoid microbeads in the meantime should avoid products containing polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and nylon, campaigners say.So far, no conclusive scientific evidence has proved the microplastics pose any threat to human health when passed up the food chain by fish. ※No studies were identified that address the potential human health effects of microplastics ingested by humans through the food chain,§ ."																																																			
																																																			
"Chris Packham, the naturalist and broadcaster, has been charged with assault and trespass in  after confronting hunters he believed had illegally trapped wild birds.The  will appear before magistrates on Thursday morning on the island of Gozo after being charged with ※attempting to use force§ and ※pushing against§ a Maltese man.Packham, who is making an independent film about Malta＊s spring hunt in which thousands of migrating birds are shot over the Mediterranean islands, had called the police after discovering a large cage of protected wild species, including goldfinch, moorhen, starlings and turtle doves. It is illegal to keep some of these birds in captivity.According to Packham, he and his producer Ruth Peacey and sound recordist Garry Moore were filming an interview on a public road when two men jumped out of a vehicle and ※started screaming and shouting and pushing§.The police were present and ※immediately took the side of the aggressors and manhandled Chris and other members of the team off the site§, according to a statement released via Packham＊s agent.After being detained for more than three hours at a police station, Packham was charged. His production team are believed to have camera footage that may exonerate him. ※It＊s intimidation and time-wasting. If they fine me it＊s just trying to thwart us,§ Packham told the Guardian.During a  Q&A session on Wednesday evening, broadcasting from the Maltese city of Mdina, he went into more detail about the incident that lead to the charges.※[The man] had some birds in a cage ＃ but by the time the police turned up, they＊d all mysteriously vanished. Weird that. And weird that he＊d given a list of these birds to police earlier in the day but he wasn＊t arrested, and he＊s not going to court, I am,§ he said, adding that he was due in court at 9am.In the Facebook Live session, Packham also emphasised that his condemnation of spring hunting didn＊t amount to persecution of the Maltese.※We＊ve come out here not as people from the UK wagging their finger at the Maltese, not even as Europeans 每 seeing as we＊re still part of the EU 每 but just as people who are concerned about the birds,§ he said.Killing birds during the spring breeding season is forbidden under the European Union birds directive but Malta has an opt-out to enable its 10,000 hunters to continue their traditional shoot of migrating birds. such as the turtle dove 每 last year added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature＊s ※red list§ of species most at risk of extinction 每 are illegally hunted. However, this year 15 corpses of protected wild species, including marsh harrier and hoopoe, have also been handed to BirdLife Malta.The environmental organisation has filmed a hunter illegally shooting a rare stone curlew. Another charity, the Committee Against Bird Slaughter (Cabs), caught two people illegally shooting turtle doves after the end of the spring hunt. Packham said he had also found golden plover held in tiny cages in the hot sun, and these crimes were ※obviously the tip of the iceberg§.※It＊s just bizarre what＊s going on,§ he said. ※What we experienced yesterday BirdLife Malta and Cabs experience all the time. It makes it so difficult to get the law upheld when the local police are very uncooperative because they will be friends of or family of or drinking in the same bar as the people we are trying to incriminate.§Malta narrowly voted to continue the tradition of spring hunting in a 2015 referendum, and Packham said the government was not doing enough to stop illegal hunting around the still-legal spring shoot.※The amount of interest and commitment that the government has put into policing these crimes has diminished because there＊s an election on the horizon [in Malta] and the government doesn＊t want to upset 10,000 hunters and their families,§ said Packham.He called on the EU to take action against Malta. ※What＊s going on contravenes the European birds directive,§ he said. ※We want Malta to comply with the birds directive like every other country does.§The Maltese police said they could not comment on an individual case."																																																			
"It was disappointing that there was no reference to the strong protective effect of breastfeeding in the prevention of sudden infant death syndrome (Sids) in the commentary on Peter Fleming＊s important and seminal work on this topic (, 27 August).Where a baby is formula-fed there is an increased risk of Sids. Given this, and when considering the huge additional financial impact of low breastfeeding rates in the UK (if nothing else, the other hot topic of obesity), I cannot understand why the government does not invest a relatively small amount in effectively and consistently supporting breastfeeding.Most women want to breastfeed but are thwarted by the lack of this support, compounded by the powerfully undermining effect of formula milk?advertising. I＊m surprised that neither Dr Peter Fleming nor the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths, which started in 1971, appears to have noticed that changes in exposure of air pollution correlate with changes in rates of infant mortality.The reduction in air pollution following the switch to cleaner North Sea gas was followed by a rapid fall in the average infant mortality rate in England and Wales, which showed that the widespread belief that high infant mortality is caused by low socioeconomic status must be false.Nine of the 10 councils in England and Wales with the highest infant mortality rates aggregated for the six years from 2009 to 2014 either have an incinerator or are adjacent to a council with an incinerator. The 10th of the above councils adjoins one with a major?cement works. The story of Peter Fleming＊s painstaking research into the causes of Sids is remarkable. A near eightfold reduction in the occurrences of the syndrome and associated family grief between 1989 and 2016 is extraordinary, both for its magnitude and the simplicity of its cause. Peter Fleming, clearly a modest man, is likely to be embarrassed with the awarding of an honour, but if ever there was justification this is it. Arise,?Sir?Peter!"																																																			
"t doesn＊t matter how many winters I endure, I am never less astounded by the arrival of spring. Suddenly, green shoots and the hint of daffodil yellow start breaking through the muddy earth. Birds sing. The air is sweet. It＊s a time of renewal 每 one that is so desperately needed for our planet and our politics.The Earth, our mother, is the body that feeds us, nurtures us, inspires us. In more than three months, Trump and his government have begun a process to remove as many protections for the Earth and for women as they can. They are willing to destroy the Earth and, ultimately, threaten the people she feeds and gives life to, in order to take care of their immediate desires. The long-term consequences are irrelevant in their minds. Many of the terms for climate destruction and violence against women are interchangeable: extraction, rape, plunder, plowing, battery and excavation. But the similarities don＊t end there. Many of those who don＊t believe in climate change are very often the same as those who do not trust the stories and reports of women who have been harassed, battered and raped. Even when more than 97% of climate scientists warn us of the same thing we don＊t believe them.  have come forward to accuse Donald Trump of sexual assault 每 allegations he has denied 每 and we don＊t believe them. It took 58 women coming forward for the stories about Bill Cosby to be believed. And there are still some who deny it. There are parallels between the high stakes scientists face in telling the truth and the potential ruin women face in coming forward to report their stories to families and courts. Or perhaps it is not and never was about believing scientists and women. No, it is clear that land exploiters and rapists actually do know what they are doing. Often they are strategic about it. One only has to read the early Exxon reports on what extraction would do to climate change or listen to the Access Hollywood tape with Donald Trump to hear their swagger and pride in being able to do what they do because they have the power.  Whether it is pulling back EPA regulations and railing against the Clean Air Act or the mad dash for money through extraction and pipelines such as the Dakota Access pipeline. Whether it＊s defunding Planned Parenthood or cutting funding to violence against women programs or reinstating and expanding the global gag rule so that healthcare for women across the world is devastated. All in the name of preventing abortion and being pro-life when their actions and policies are murderous and destructive in every direction. For years I have been fighting rape, battery, incest, female genital mutilation and sex trafficking. The staggering numbers of one out of three women raped and beaten on the planet have occupied my life from morning till night. But the story is even bigger, the mindset more pervasive. We can＊t separate out the pieces of the story.  Humanity is struggling to determine whether we will accept living and dying in a world where 0.1% of the people reign over our Earth, our bodies, our rights in service of their own interests and profit or whether we collectively rise and fight to transform this predatory paradigm. But this morning as I awoke to the softness and generosity of spring, it was so clear and simple. Every struggle we have 每 women＊s liberation, racial justice, economic inequality, immigration rights, gender rights, disability rights 每 happens on the Earth, because of the Earth.  So that＊s why I am rising on 29 April with the climate march. Let our passion and fight for our mother be the energy and trajectory that fuels us and binds us to a larger struggle to end and transform this deadly and exploitative mindset. Let our fight for the mother bring forth a global spring. Now more than ever we need a renewal in our dedication to a world where women, and indeed, all of life, triumph over destruction and the forces of anti-life."																																																			
" love an enthusiast, and an expert. Professor Doug Emlen is both. You can see it when he holds a huge elk antler, turning it and looking at it admiringly, the way a firearms enthusiast would look at a big gun. Well, an antler is a weapon, weapons are Prof Doug＊s things, this is  (BBC2).Emlen likes chameleons, too, because they are the quintessential ambush predator: they sit tight, camouflaged, their eyes can swivel in different directions, and they thwap out their tongues to ambush their prey. But there are varieties of chameleons Doug gets especially excited about: the ones with horns. ※These guys look like little dinosaurs,§ he says, gleefully. ※Think of this like  jousting as these males try and push and pry and twist each other off the branch.§But Emlen is not just a TV person getting the horn about macho predators, and nature＊s epic battles. As a biologist, he has spent years studying the species whose weapons are taken to extremes, piecing together the evidence to explain their evolution. And he has found that, for an arms race to happen, certain conditions need to be in place. By watching male Chilean beetles (very big jaws, very macho) knock each other off trees so they can stay at the sap and get female beetles (small jaws, prettier), Doug concludes that there needs to be a defendable resource (sap = sex) against which fights can take place.Elephants next. Females are fertile for only about five days every four years. So competition for them is intense 每 that＊s condition number two for an arms race, and why male elephants have very big tusks.And for the final evolutionary pressure, it＊s back to beetles, dung ones this time. Doug finds that they 每 and all other creatures with extreme weapons 每 do battle one-on-one. ※It＊s no accident that for 5,000 years of recorded human history the only sort of fight that has ever mattered for honour or status is the duel.§Ah. There＊s another species that has developed extreme weapons: us. And it was hard not to think of the cold war, and what＊s going on now, the moment this began. Does ideology count as a defendable resource I wonder? That elk might as well have been called Kim Jong-un. The only way it can develop its big weapons is to shunt reserves (of calcium) away from the rest of its body, pulling important reserves to allocate to the weapons, so that it is sick, dying even. Antlers, missiles; calcium, money; body, population 每 what＊s the difference? Oh, Kim＊s Antlers don＊t even work, snapped on impact.Emlen explores the parallels between animals arms races and our own further; he visits Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, which is equipped with Minuteman III nuclear missiles. They are the big ones, the most destructive weapons on earth, though Ross, the corporal showing him round, can＊t go into detail. ※We will launch the missiles but the person who has the authority is the president,§ says Corporal Ross in a missile launch training facility. Yeah, thanks for the reminder. A giant golden-haired rogue male dung beetle, with tiny minute man hands but massivenuclear horns, 150 of them just here.So in nature, the really big weapons 每 like the giant claw of the fiddler crab 每 are rarely deployed, they are just a deterrent? Hmmm, not sure that＊s reassuring, when this particular fiddler crab, the Mar-a-Lago variety, shows few signs of following predictable patterns of evolutionary science. Yeah, I know he was a dung beetle, he morphed into a fiddler crab, all right? Watch out for that claw, ladies. Ouch.It＊s fascinating, and terrifying, with a few jolly subplots and anomalies along the way. Like the Jesus Christ birds for whom it＊s the females who are the aggressors and hold the weapons. And the sneaky weaponless male dung beetles who dig secret love tunnels to mate with the big guys＊ females.Donald Jr and Eric gets parts in the story, too. Weapon sizes in some animal populations 每 including elephants, big horn sheep and caribous 每 are decreasing. And the trigger for this change? Trophy hunters, who, in prizing the biggest horns, tusks and antlers are actually inadvertently removing the genes for the biggest weapons. Quite ironic really.But I＊m afraid it＊s only a small part of the story. The big one is still that the males with the biggest and most extreme weapons are the most successful.

"Three boys chase each other and a small dog around a tree at the project in East Chicago, Indiana, under the watchful eyes of 80-year-old Mary Fluellen .※Wash your hands when you get inside!§ says Fluellen, better known as ※Granny§ around the complex. Over the past few weeks residents have  telling them to wash their hands thoroughly and leave their shoes at the door, to avoid spreading lead that has been found in dangerously high levels in soil at the housing project.But such precautionary measures seem futile after years of families living amid the contamination.※We used to have mud fights and play slip-and-slide§ on the wet grass, remembers Anthony Abbey, 33, who grew up in the housing complex. ※You were throwing lead at each other,§ notes Mario Irving.The community of about 1,100 mostly African American residents of the housing project has been reeling since receiving word in the past month that they have to relocate. The tidy two-storey brick units where many have lived for decades will be torn down because of massive levels of lead and arsenic contamination in the soil, deceptively masked by lush green grass and clumps of flowers.There have been concerns about lead contamination for decades, and tests by the  a decade ago found hot spots of serious contamination. But federal and state officials had concluded residents were not at risk until the May release of comprehensive soil test results, which showed more than half the project＊s yards exceeded lead levels that would trigger emergency cleanup, and many also had high levels of arsenic.Many residents say they were unaware of the situation until they received letters in July from the city＊s mayor, Anthony Copeland, noting the findings and stating: ※We feel it is in your best interest to temporarily relocate your household.§Since then, local children and adults have been getting blood tests. Many have come back showing serious levels of lead; others are awaiting their results, and still others have gotten results that are considered safe. But people who have lost all trust in official sources don＊t believe them.Parents and grandparents say they are torn between competing impulses: anxious to move out of an environment that may be causing children irreversible harm, but wary of shattering a community home to many extended families and lifelong friends.※It＊s very tight-knit,§ said Milton Ross, a wiry 62-year-old construction worker who lives with his mother in the complex. ※When I first heard, my heart told Jesus: ＆Wherever we all go, I hope there are a lot of events where we can come back and get together.＊§There have been concerns about lead contamination in the soil here since at least 1985, when a nearby lead smelter shut down. In soil tests released in 2006, the EPA found seriously elevated lead levels in some areas. Those spots were cleaned up, and in 2009 the site was added to the Superfund National Priorities List. The federal government oversaw blood tests of local children. But in 2011 a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released saying that declining numbers of children with elevated blood lead levels led them to conclude the contamination did not pose a public health threat.The EPA cited this finding as the reason it did not more aggressively continue to test the soil, at least not until it had to develop a cleanup plan under with the companies responsible for polluting the area, the DuPont chemical company and Atlantic Richfield Company. released in May showed soil in the majority of yards above the EPA＊s 1,200 parts per million standard for emergency cleanup. The EPA maintains it could remediate the soil in yards and residents could continue living there. But city officials said they think the lead stirred up during remediation would be a risk to residents. And since the city had already decided the complex would be demolished in coming years, officials decided it wouldn＊t make sense to remediate it.Now residents are getting Housing Choice Vouchers that subsidize rental units. But there are ceilings on how much rent the voucher will cover, and many prospective renters struggle to find landlords who will accept the vouchers.City attorney Carla Morgan said that officials are scrambling to find new homes for the 357 families who live in the West Calumet project.While the West Calumet housing complex will be evacuated and torn down, the EPA is testing soil across the rest of the, filled with single-family homes, small businesses, multiple churches and a relatively new but now vacant elementary school. The agency has estimated 723 of 1,271 parcels in the area will need to be cleaned up.※I＊m praying,§ said Jennifer Sims, 57, who lives in her childhood home a few blocks from the housing project. Sims grew up playing in the housing project, and remembers that ※mothers and families lived on the gardens§ growing vegetables in the tainted soil. ※Why did they do this to us?§The impacts of longstanding lead contamination in West Calumet could also stretch to surrounding areas, where many people who grew up there have dispersed.Tyra Taylor, 45, raised her three kids in West Calumet. Her daughter, now 25, has epilepsy and cervical cancer, she said. And Taylor suffers from a long list of health problems including neuropathy, glaucoma and a disorder which causes her to faint frequently. Now living in a rental unit a block away, she thinks the lead and arsenic contamination explain a lot about the family＊s health.※It＊s the lead!§ she says, throwing her arms wide.Like many residents, she is angry that the housing authority and EPA continued to allow residents to live in the project after contamination was suspected and then confirmed.Residents said they never would have moved here if they knew about the contamination, but they said they were left in the dark until just recently.Robert Kaplan, the EPA Region 5 acting administrator, noted that over the years there have been multiple public comment periods, meetings hosted in local libraries and postcards sent out about the soil testing and cleanup plans.※I understand that there are newer residents and people moving in and out, so outreach can be difficult,§ Kaplan said, but ※under the usual Superfund process, everything is public notice ... We received no public comment including from the city.§Many residents attribute the situation to racism; national pundits have compared it to the , where officials let residents drink contaminated water for months.※They think because we stay over here we＊re nothing, we＊re lowlifes, we＊re black and we＊re poor, they treat us like dogs,§ said Irving, who is a single father and a student at Ivy Tech community college. ※They＊re killing us softly.§Morgan said the current mayoral administration cannot be accused of environmental injustice since Copeland has been proactive on the issue, and since city officials are largely African American and from similar socioeconomic backgrounds to the affected residents. The EPA said of residents＊ feelings of injustice: ※Protecting public health, especially in environmental justice communities is a top priority for EPA. That＊s why the Agency has taken many steps over the past several years to keep the residents of the West Calumet Housing Project informed about the work being done in their area to reduce lead exposure.§Meanwhile Taylor prefers to temper her anger with laughter.※If you scratch our arms along a piece of paper, you can write, like a pencil,§ she says. ※It＊s the lead!§ "																																																			
"Conservationists have lodged a formal request for the US government to list giraffes as endangered in a bid to prevent what they call the ※silent extinction§ of the world＊s tallest land animal.A legal petition filed by five environmental groups has demanded that the US Fish and  Service provide endangered species protections to the giraffe, which has suffered a precipitous decline in numbers in recent years.According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, , just 97,500 of the animals exist in sub-Saharan Africa today, a drop of almost 40% since 1985. There are now fewer giraffes than elephants in Africa. Giraffes have suffered from loss of habitat, disease and illegal hunting for bushmeat. They also face the risk of collisions with vehicles and power lines. But the petitioners argue that the species is facing added pressure from ※trophy§ hunters who travel to Africa to shoot their big-game quarry. These hunters overwhelmingly come from the US.According to the groups＊ analysis of import data, Americans imported 21,402 bone carvings, 3,008 skin pieces and 3,744 miscellaneous hunting trophies from giraffes over the past decade. At least 3,700 individual giraffes are thought to have been killed for such items.An endangered species listing would place heavy restrictions on any American hunter wishing to travel to Africa and bring back a slaughtered giraffe. A hunter would have to somehow demonstrate the taking of the giraffe trophy was helping sustain the species. The petition states that the US is ※uniquely positioned to help conserve these tall, graceful and iconic animals§.It adds: ※Considering the ongoing threats to giraffes and their small remaining populations, now is the time for Endangered Species Act protections for this seriously and increasingly imperiled species.§The plight of giraffes, which have necks as long as six feet and tongues that reach 20in, has caught some conservationists by surprise. The peril faced by the animals has somewhat been overshadowed by the poaching crisis engulfing elephants and rhinos as well as high profile controversies such as the  by a Minnesota dentist in Zimbabwe in 2015.But recent surveys have painted a stark picture of decline for giraffes, which now live in increasingly fragmented habitats. The role played by trophy hunters was highlighted in August when pictures emerged of a 12-year-old girl from Utah  beside the slumped body of a dead giraffe. ※When I was doing research on giraffes in Kenya a few years ago, they were quite abundant and no one questioned that they were doing well,§ said Jeff Flocken, North America regional director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw). ※Only recently have we looked at them critically and seen this huge drop, which has been a shock to the conservation community. This is an iconic animal and it＊s in deep trouble.§Flocken said while the US could not do much to prevent the killing of giraffes in Africa, the regulation of trophy imports would be a ※significant§ step in stemming the decline of the species. ※In the past few years, several gruesome images of trophy hunters next to slain giraffe bodies have caused outrage, bringing this senseless killing to light,§ said Masha Kalinina, international trade policy specialist with Humane Society International. ※Currently, no US or international law protects giraffes against overexploitation for trade. It is clearly time to change this. As the largest importer of trophies in the world, the role of the United States in the decline of this species is undeniable, and we must do our part to protect these animals.§ In September, genetic research  that there are four distinct species of giraffe, not just one as long believed. However, the endangered species petition requests protection for all giraffes regardless of sub-species. The Fish and Wildlife Service  in an attempt to conserve the species. Donald Trump＊s sons, who are avid hunters, have been  holding parts of an elephant and a leopard. However, the process of listing endangered species has not been altered under the new administration.Under federal rules, the Fish & Wildlife Service has 90 days to respond to the petition and determine whether a listing may be warranted. It can then take  to assess and decide upon the request."																																																			
"For the fisherfolk of India＊s southern state of Kerala, risking life and limb is part of everyday life.As fish stocks deplete in coastal waters because of overfishing and climate change, fishermen have no option but to venture ever further out to sea on small boats, flimsy canoes and catamarans. These modest craft are prone to accidents, especially during the monsoon season from June to August. The absence of navigational aids, radio communication or safety devices heightens the risks.Radio Monsoon, a collaborative project that grew out of a competition at the University of Sussex, is designed to help, using a low-tech forecast service to ensure safer working conditions among the 30,000-plus fishing families in the area.During its pilot, Radio Monsoon provided daily forecasts in the local language of Malayalam, specifically tailored for 10 fishing villages along the 80km Thiruvananthapuram coast. These areas are particularly vulnerable to bad weather and natural disasters. Based on data from India＊s national meteorological department and the centre for ocean information services , as well as local knowledge, Radio Monsoon＊s forecasts are disseminated through social media, loudspeakers placed in harbours, and by word of mouth.Fishermen can also access forecasts over a phone line supported by an internet server. Their feedback is collected regularly and relayed to the forecasters so that the information can be adapted to their needs.Maxmillan Martin, who is from Kerala and is now a research associate at the University of Sussex, first had the idea for Radio Monsoon in collaboration with friends after . The group 每 a retired teacher, a journalist, a user interface designer and a social media expert, all from Kerala 每 came up with a narrowcast system whereby forecasts recorded on to CDs would be played in the harbour. ※It was a very low-tech intervention but the fishermen loved it and the local forecasters did too,§ says Martin. ※It worked but we went on with our lives.§Martin, who has a background in geography, resurrected the idea while doing his PhD at the University of Sussex, entering it into a competition for innovation funding. A full-blown pilot followed in 2014, and ran on a ※shoestring budget§ until 2016, when funds ran out.Team now plans to relaunch and expand the project, monitoring its impact on fatalities and the search and rescue operations that currently save about 3,000 lives a year.Before Radio Monsoon, there was no widely used local and regular marine weather information service for local fishing communities. With families reliant on the money made from fishing hauls, a culture of risk-taking emerged.※Once, my boat capsized and I hit my head. I had to swim and reach the shore,§ recalls Sebastian Kristudasan, 40, a fisherman in Kerala. ※In such situations, if someone is nearby, they will save the fisherman; we save ourselves or we are gone.§Fishermen usually venture 70-80km from shore, says Kristudasan, adding that it can be difficult to navigate back if they go out too far. ※Long ago, people could navigate looking at [the] stars. Now we don＊t do that. GPS can help us coordinate. If there is no GPS, we go to a distance where we can see the shore and the mountains.※Beyond that, we estimate the distance by using our hands [the distance between the tips of outstretched hands being one fathom or six feet].§Wilson Franklin, another local fisherman, says: ※In June and from then on, it is do-or-die trips for us. The sea faces terrible storms. You can die, or lose your gear, you can escape on some other land, or suffer an accident while returning. Or you can come back safe. You have to careful during these three months. By September the sea becomes calmer.§Martin said fishermen do not always heed advice, especially since their livelihood depends on them going out to fish whatever the weather. ※They told us they just take their gear on to the boats and nothing for safety, because they believe they just need to be able to swim. If they are good swimmers, then they can do it; if not, the attitude was ＆Well, that＊s too bad.＊ They are not really afraid because it＊s just part of their lives. The way they perceive risk is totally different than how we do.§"

"Australia will need to review its participation in the Paris agreement on climate change if  follows through with his threat to withdraw from the treaty, according to the chair of the Turnbull government＊s backbench committee on environment and energy.Craig Kelly told Guardian Australia on Wednesday he＊d predicted immediately after Trump＊s election that the Paris climate deal was ※cactus§ and he stood by that assessment.Trump on Tuesday night Australian time  to unravel a number of Barack Obama＊s regulatory measures to combat climate change, including eliminating the clean power plan, which sets limits on the amount of greenhouse gases that power plants emit.The latest executive order is seen as a prelude to the US following through with the campaign commitment to withdraw from the Paris deal.Australian conservatives are watching events in the US closely.Kelly said he was aware of the new executive order, and if Trump went the extra step and withdrew from the Paris agreement: ※I think we have to review it.§The former Liberal senator , who now sits on the crossbench, holds the same view.※It is clear America intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement and it would be folly for Australia to be part of it,§ Bernardi said. ※I don＊t think we should subsume our national interest to international bodies.§Bernardi this week sparked a rebellion inside the government by  on the basis the country＊s legal system was deficient.The disallowance motion prompted a number of Liberals to express opposition to the extradition treaty.If Trump withdraws from the Paris deal, Bernardi will likely use the development as a recruitment drive for his new  movement, which will put pressure on conservative MPs in the government.Kelly, who chairs the government＊s backbench committee on climate and energy, has been campaigning internally for months, arguing that the federal renewable energy target should be frozen at its current level.The Sydney Liberal backbencher said regardless of what the US ultimately did, he had concerns about what the Paris deal could achieve.Kelly said even if you accepted that fiddling with ※the CO2 knob§ could influence climate change, he had doubts that countries could meet their Paris commitments ※without a technological breakthrough§.Asked whether a majority of his Coalition colleagues would be in favour of quitting the Paris deal in the event Trump pulled out, Kelly argued ※it would be a close run thing§.He said government MPs were under pressure from voters who believed renewable energy targets were responsible for higher power prices.The prime minister has signalled Australia will stay the course if the Trump administration follows through with its threats to quit the Paris deal.Turnbull  it would take four years to withdraw from the agreement after ratification."																																																			
"The world＊s most widely used insecticides would be banned from all fields across Europe under draft regulations from the , seen by the Guardian.The documents are the first indication that the powerful commission wants a complete ban and cite ※high acute risks to bees§. A ban could be in place this year if the proposals are approved by a majority of EU member states.  and other pollinators are vital for many food crops but have been declining for decades due to habitat loss, disease and pesticide use. The insecticides, called neonicotinoids, have been in use for over 20 years and have been linked to serious harm in bees.A fierce battle has been fought between environmental campaigners and farming and pesticides groups. The latter argue the insecticides are vital for crop protection and that opposition is to them is political.The EU imposed a  on some crops in 2013. However, the new proposals are for a complete ban on their use in fields, with the only exception being for plants entirely grown in greenhouses. The proposals could be voted on as soon as May and, if approved, would enter force within months.The 2013 ban went ahead after those nations opposing the measure, including the UK, failed to muster enough votes. However, since then, the UK government seems to have softened its opposition, having rejected repeated requests from British farmers for ※emergency§ authorisation to use the banned pesticides.※The amount of scientific evidence on the toxicity of these insecticides is so high that there is no way these chemicals should remain on the market,§ said Martin Dermine, at Pesticide Action Network Europe, which obtained the leaked proposals and shared them with the Guardian. ※PAN Europe will fight with its partners to obtain support for the proposal from a majority of member states.§ A , from Avaaz, has gathered 4.4m signatures.There is a  that bees are exposed to neonicotinoid pesticides in fields and suffer serious harm from the doses they receive. There is only a little evidence to date that this harm ultimately leads to falls in overall bee populations, though results from major field trials are expected soon.However, the European commission (EC) has decided to move towards implementing a complete ban now, based on risk assessments of the pesticides by the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa), published in 2016. Efsa considered evidence submitted by the pesticide manufacturers but the EC concluded that ※high acute risks for bees§ had been identified for ※most crops§ from  and , both made by Bayer. For , made by Syngenta, the EC said the company＊s evidence was ※not sufficient to address the risks§.Paul de Zylva, at Friends of the Earth, said: ※The science is catching up with the pesticide industry 每 the EU and UK government must call time on neonics. Going neonic-free puts farmers more in control of their land instead of having to defer to advice from pesticide companies.§However, Sarah Mukherjee, chief executive of the Crop Protection Association, which represents pesticide makers, said: ※We are disappointed with this [EC] proposal, which seems more of a political judgement than sound science.§ She said the Efsa assessments were based on what the CPA sees as unworkable guidance that did not have formal approval from EU countries: ※The proposal is based on an assessment using the unapproved  and perfectly illustrates the consequences of using this guidance.

"his week, I learned that Sirocco 每 media superstar, comedy legend and one of the world＊s  - has . The , who lives wild on a remote New Zealand island, evaded a recent search by scientists who wanted to capture him for a routine health check. Today is Sirocco＊s 20th birthday 每 or ※hatchday§ to be precise 每 but no one can say for certain whether he is alive or dead. Is he an ex-parrot or is he just resting? Is he out there pining or has he passed on?Despite this being the biggest parrot story since , Sirocco＊s disappearance seems to have ruffled few feathers. The media has been slow to pick up on his disappearance, and the bureau responsible for policing the world＊s parrots 每 Interpolly 每 has yet to file a ※missing parrot report§. But why should we care that a big, green, dumpy parrot has gone Awol? Allow me to explain.First and foremost, Sirocco is one of the rarest, most unusual parrots on the planet. Once so common they could be shaken from the boughs of New Zealand＊s trees like apples, k芋k芋p身s took a hammering after human settlers haphazardly introduced predatory non-native species such as stoats and rats. Large, flightless and tasty, k芋k芋p身s were easy pickings. At their lowest ebb, in 1995, there were just 51 left alive. Now, thanks to an , there are 154. Sirocco is one of them.Secondly, Sirocco is a comedy genius. The frisky fellow rocketed to fame when he tried to mate with the zoologist Mark Carwardine , prompting co-host Stephen Fry to comment, ※You are being shagged by a rare parrot. When you have the chick, I want you to call it Stephen.§ It was post-watershed TV gold: a moment of innocent parrot porn that has since titillated more than 7 million viewers on YouTube (beat that, Snowball).Thirdly, Sirocco is a Kiwi national treasure (impressive since he＊s not an actual Kiwi) whose life story bears all the hallmarks of a genuine rock＊n＊roll star.There were the difficult formative years, when chick-hood illness saw him prised from the nest to be reared by strangers. A bold move that undoubtedly saved his life, it was the start of an unnatural addiction that continues to blight his life: Sirocco became hooked on humans.As an adolescent on the remote , he eschewed female k芋k芋p身s, preferring instead to serenade the researchers that stayed there with his booming, bass-heavy love song ＃ night after night after night. When it became clear he would never father chicks of his own, conservationists dreamed up another way for him to help his species. Sirocco became New Zealand＊s official ※spokesbird for conservation§. Since then he＊s visited the New Zealand parliament, and now alternates jet-setting around to meet his human fans, with periods of wild respite.The good news is, I am certain that Sirocco is still alive. I know this because he＊s still posting regular updates to his 13,600 followers on Twitter () ＃ which is ironic given that he can ※boom§, ※skraaark§, ※ching§ and make all manner of weird noises, but he can＊t tweet. , fans have speculated that he is having a midlife crisis 每 unlikely, as k芋k芋p身s can live well past 70, making Sirocco a whippersnapper 每 or that he has gone to steal a birthday kiss from Mark Carwardine. The truth, however, may be more mundane. This is not a poly-gon: rather a polly-in-hiding.When I spoke to Andrew Digby, science adviser for the K芋k芋p身 Recovery Programme, he told me that Sirocco is probably alive and well on the same predator-free island where they left him, but has inadvertently ※gone dark§ because his radio transmitter has failed. All k芋k芋p身s are fitted with them, but 5% of the electronic devices go on the blink each year. They hope to track him down later this year.For me, it＊s entirely in keeping with Sirocco＊s hectic, superstar lifestyle that he should choose to take a break from the limelight. My prediction is that he＊s taking some time out to recharge his creative juices before making a spectacular comeback next breeding season. In the meantime: happy birthday, Sirocco."																																																			
																																																			
" Fish are being killed, and prevented from reaching maturity, by the , new research has proved.Some young fish have been found to prefer tiny particles of plastic to their natural food sources, effectively starving them before they can reproduce.The  每 tiny particles of polymer-type materials from modern industry 每 has been thought for several years to be a peril for fish, but the study published on Thursday is the first to prove the damage in trials.Microplastics are near-indestructible in natural environments. They enter the oceans through litter, when waste such as , packaging and other convenience materials are discarded. Vast amounts of these end up in the sea, through inadequate waste disposal systems and sewage outfall.Another growing source is , tiny particles of hard plastics that are used in cosmetics, for instance as an abrasive in . These easily enter waterways as they are washed off as they are used, flushed down drains and forgotten, but can last for decades in our oceans.The  has been hard to measure, despite being a growing source of concern. Small particles of plastics have been found in seabirds, fish and whales, which swallow the materials but cannot digest them, tracts.For the first time, scientists have demonstrated that fish exposed to such materials during their development show stunted growth and increased mortality rates, as well as changed behaviour that could endanger their survival.Samples of perch, still in their larval state, were shown not only to take in the plastics, but to prefer them to their real food. Larval perch with access to microplastic particles ate only the plastics, ignoring their natural food source of plankton.The study, published in Science on Thursday, found that the fish born into an environment rich in microplastics 每 defined as tiny pieces of less than 5mm in size 每 had reduced rates of hatching and development to maturity.The perch studied also ignored the chemical signals that would normally warn them of the presence of predators, the researchers found.These particles are now found in abundance across the world＊s oceans, and are often common in shallow coastal areas, where they wash in from waste dumps and sewerage systems.※This is the first time an animal has been found to preferentially feed on plastic particles, and is cause for concern,§ said Peter Ekl?v, co-author of the study. ※Larvae exposed to microplastic particles during development also displayed changed behaviours and were much less active than fish that had been reared in water that contained no microplastic particles.§Environmental campaigners have been calling for a reduction in the waste allowed to drift from rivers into seas and oceans, and for an end to the use of artificial . Greenpeace  against microbeads early this year, and .However, the study suggests that damage has already been done, and preventing the leakage of more microplastics into the oceans should be a matter of urgency, as once they are in our seas they are almost impossible to get rid of.Perch exposed to microplastics in the study were eaten by pike four times more quickly than their naturally-reared relatives, when the predators were introduced into their environment. All of the plastic-exposed fish in the study were dead within 48 hours.This suggests that the impacts of microplastics are likely to be far-reaching and long-lasting, beyond the immediate effects on the fish＊s digestive systems, which was previously the main cause of concern.  may be causing differing behaviour in the fish, and inhibiting their evolved responses to danger, through mechanisms not yet fully understood.The study adds to research that has found coastal fish species suffering marked declines in recent years, while the amount of plastic litter in the oceans has increased.※If early life-history stages of other species are similarly affected by microplastics, and this translates to increased mortality rates, the effects on aquatic ecosystems could be profound,§ warned Oona L?nnstedt, another of the report＊s authors.

He＊s an intolerant and small-minded individual, who is despised by many.※If he comes here, people will take to the streets to protest against his deplorable values, which fuel such hatred and division.§Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now, also a member of the Stop Trump coalition, said: ※We know Trump is now scared to come to the UK on the state visit which  foolishly offered him, because he will face one of the largest protests in history.※This month＊s visit, if it happens, is a way of him sneaking in the back door in the hope that he can save face for himself and May. ※But we＊ll oppose him whenever and however he comes to the UK because Trump is very bad news on some of the most important issues humanity faces: climate change, migration, inequality, corporate regulation. ※We won＊t allow Trump＊s presidency to be normalised, and we＊ll make sure Theresa May pays a political cost for supporting Trump and his politics of hate.§Simon Bullock, a climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth, another member of the Stop Trump coalition, said: ※It would be no surprise if Donald Trump arrived in the UK with little fanfare to try and avoid the huge public protests that a state visit is likely to generate.※The US withdrawal from the Paris climate treaty is an international disgrace which puts the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the globe into jeopardy. ※Theresa May must make it perfectly clear that there will be no trade deal with the US while President Trump refuses to face up to his international responsibilities on cutting emissions.§Lindsey German, the convenor of the Stop the War Coalition, said: ※Trump＊s sneak visit here is as unwelcome as his proposed state visit. He has endorsed the rightwing fundamentalist regime in Saudi Arabia, dropped the mother of all bombs on Afghanistan and the US-led coalition is responsible for many civilian deaths in Mosul. ※He is a threat to world peace and should be stopped. His travel ban on people from six Muslim countries only helps stoke racism.※The protests earlier this year have forced him to arrive by stealth to avoid the opposition to him coming on to the streets.

"Authorities in Hong Kong have announced what they say is  of about 7.2 tonnes of ivory tusks with an estimated street value close to HK$72m (?7m).If the size of the haul is verified, it will replace the current record held by Singapore for a seizure of 7.138 tonnes of ivory tusks in 2002. The EU＊s environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella, told the Guardian: ※The authorities of  did a great job with this massive ivory seizure. It indicates that ivory trafficking continues at shocking levels. But it showcases how coordinated enforcement action brings results. Our EU action plan against wildlife trafficking is a significant part of this coordination.※Arresting wildlife criminals is a priority for us and we will continue to work with countries all over the world to clamp down on these transnational criminal activities.§Hong Kong customs inspectors found the cargo on Tuesday when they searched a Malaysian shipment declared to be containing frozen fish at the Kwai Chung custom house.The owner of a trading company and two staff members were arrested after the tusks were found hidden beneath frozen fish cartons in the 12-metre (40ft) container.Yannick Kuehl, the East Asia director of the conservation group Traffic, warmly congratulated the Hong Kong authorities for the groundbreaking seizure. ※But it is vital for a full and thorough investigation to take place to find out who was orchestrating this massive movement of contraband,§ he added.Ivory hauls of 500kg or more are thought to indicate involvement of organised crime gangs, according to Cites guidelines, and Hong Kong has long been viewed as , partly because of its legal ※worked§ ivory-carvings market, .Between 2014 and 2015, imports of worked ivory pieces from the EU rose from 1,572 to 10,671 pieces, according to data from the Hong Kong government＊s agriculture, fisheries and conservation department.Daniela Freyer, of the Pro  campaign group, said the seizure announced today was ※an alarm call for the immediate shutdown of Hong Kong＊s ivory markets once and for all.※Further delays of a ban on ivory would be deadly for Africa＊s elephants,§ she added. A  is under way, with a phase-out of the domestic ivory trade within five years being debated by Hong Kong＊s legislative council. China has said that it will end domestic ivory trading before 2018.※No doubt Hong Kong＊s geographic location, coupled with the currently relatively lenient penalties in place for anyone convicted of wildlife crime, are reasons behind the shipment coming through the port,§ Kuehl said. ※The case for increasing penalties has never been stronger.§Under Hong Kong law, wildlife smuggling is punishable by a fine of up to HK$5m, while trafficking contraband can trigger a maximum prison sentence of seven years.

"※You told us to buy diesels!§These days the average diesel driver is not a happy camper. Hot on the heels of , we now have the government telling us diesels are not a green choice after all. Sadiq Khan, London＊s mayor, is blaming diesel cars for poor air quality in the capital and .At the same time, the government is still encouraging us to buy diesels. The vehicle excise duty for a car registered after 1 April 2017 is still based on how much carbon dioxide it produces. This tends to push buyers behind the wheel of a diesel, which usually produces less CO2 than an equivalent petrol.While diesel engines produce less CO2, they do emit other forms of air pollution 每 especially ※sooty particulates§. In layman＊s terms, these are unburned bits of tarry nastiness. That is what we are breathing in when we live in a city. Good news and bad news then: diesels are slightly better at saving the planet 每 or at least killing it more slowly 每 but they＊re choking our kids.How did we get into this mess? In political terms, it comes down to a difference of opinion between two Labour politicians. More generally, it says a lot about how the public, politicians and experts talk to one another.For the political history, we need to look back to 1998 when his integrated transport white paper, A New Deal for Everyone. He wanted to use fuel duty to encourage us to buy cleaner fuels. The white paper said: ※We are moving towards a fairer treatment of diesel and petrol, based on the energy and carbon content of these fuels. This will mean that the duty on diesel should be higher than on petrol. We began this process in March 1998: duty on diesel is now 1p a litre more than unleaded petrol, and we intend to increase this differential in future years.§The white paper was pretty clear. The government half-liked diesel because it produced less CO2, and low-sulphur diesel was better than nasty ordinary diesel. But air pollution wasn＊t just about CO2. The other pollutants chucked out by diesel meant that, on balance, the tax regime should be pushing people towards petrol. In Prescott＊s world, there was a hierarchy of sinfulness. Walking and cycling were very good. Unleaded petrol was slightly better than low-sulphur diesel. Smelly old diesel was the fuel of Satan.The  and Alistair Darling＊s budget of 2009 unpicked all of this. From 2000, the fuel duty rates for petrol and diesel were made the same, and have remained so ever since. In his 2009 budget, Darling replaced the flat rate of vehicle excise duty with rates graduated by CO2.This reversed Prescott＊s idea. Instead of nudging people towards unleaded petrol, the budget of 2009 pushed us towards diesels because of their lower CO2 emissions. Reducing CO2 was seen as more important than tackling air pollution in cities. The government of the day presumably thought that vehicle technology would improve to make diesels cleaner.Something else was happening. It is something that often happens when a politician has a bright idea about a new policy. Picture the scene in an office somewhere in Whitehall. The minister bursts in to Sir Humphrey＊s office in a quiver of excitement.※I＊ve had a great idea,§ says the minister. ※We＊ll reduce carbon dioxide by getting everyone to buy diesels. I was having dinner the other night with a chap from Volkswagen who was telling me all about it.§Sir Humphrey ums and ahs. ※Actually, minister, it＊s not quite so simple. On the one hand, diesels are good for reducing CO2. On the other hand, they＊re not so good for air pollution in cities.§The minister laughs. ※The public don＊t vote for ＆one hand/other hand＊ arguments. They want their policies to be simple to understand. The sort of thing you can write on the side of a bus.§That is where we are today. Politicians and the public like simple policies where any problem can be solved by building a wall, leaving the EU or banning something. But we live in a complicated world that does not lend itself to simple solutions. We lurch from one well-intentioned policy to another as we discover the unexpected consequences of simple soundbite policies.Sometimes the answer really is ※on the one hand ＃ on the other hand ＃§"																																																			
"Coal dust released from Adani＊s Queensland coal port after  appears to have caused ※massive contamination§ of sensitive wetlands, an academic expert says.A vast swathe of the Caley Valley wetlands has been blackened by coal-laden water released from nearby Abbot Point port after Debbie＊s torrential rains inundated its coal storage facilities last month.Satellite imagery of the coal spill last week prompted an investigation by the  Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (EHP), which said the port operator appeared to have acted in line with a temporary licence to release the excess water.The caveat was that the licence did not ※authorise environmental harm§, an environment department spokeswoman said.Norm Duke, a principal research scientist at James Cook University＊s TropWater unit and an expert in diagnosing contamination of wetlands, said an aerial image of the area showed ※there＊s undoubtedly going to be environmental harm§. ※The image shows me a massive contamination of an area that I＊m very familiar with,§ Duke told Guardian Australia. ※That＊s not an area they should be dumping their stuff in.※I＊m surprised [they were allowed to do so] 每 in some ways it would be almost better going into the sea rather than dropping it into somewhere it＊s just going to cause long-term damage.§Duke, who has done extensive research on contamination of mangroves from oil spills, said he had ※never seen anything as bad as this for coal dust§.The spread of coal dust over a ※huge§ area of the wetlands risked creating a ※double whammy§ of harm that would have dire implications for local flora and fauna, from fish and birds to molluscs and crabs, he said.First, the sediment would raise the level of mangroves where ※if you change the elevation even by a few millimetres, some plants and animals will not be able to live there because the tidal regime will change dramatically§. This could then be compounded by the potentially toxic effects of coal dust. The extent of both problems could be established almost immediately with site visits, Duke said. But a further problem could emerge months later in the dry season, when fine coal dust could suffocate plants, he said.※We are looking at something nobody＊s going to clean up,§ Duke said. The department launched an investigation after it became aware of satellite imagery last Thursday apparently showing sediment-laden water flowing from Abbot Point＊s settlement ponds into the adjacent wetland, a spokeswoman said.The investigation was into ※whether there has been any unauthorised releases of water§ into the wetlands.※Initial monitoring results indicate releases to Caley Valley wetland were in accordance with§ the conditions of a temporary emissions licence [TEL] granted to Abbot Point, which allowed the release of water with up to 100mg per litre of ※total suspended solids§, she said.※In the event of major rainfall and flooding, mines and associated sites can apply to EHP for a temporary emissions licence, which is a permit that temporarily relaxes or modifies the conditions of an environmental authority.※A TEL does not authorise environmental harm.§The spokeswoman said the investigation was continuing, ※including accessing historical satellite imagery to compare wetland colour and depth fluctuations§.A spokesman for Adani said the company believed it had acted ※within the requirements of the temporary emissions licence§.Peter McCallum of Mackay Conservation Group said the spill in 5,000-hectare wetlands that were home to more than 40,000 shore birds showed ※the lack of capacity Adani has to operate in a sensitive environment§.The group has written to Queensland＊s environment minister, Steven Miles, asking how the government intended to rehabilitate the wetlands and whether any prosecutions for environmental damage would follow.The Palaszczuk government came to power in 2015 having promised to scrap an earlier plan to allow Adani to dump dredge spoil from the port expansion on to the Caley Valley. The plan is now to dump spoil on a disused industrial site near the port and the wetlands.Adani has directly controlled the running of the port since September, when it bought out previous operator Glencore.It bought a 99-year lease on the port in 2011 and says it has invested more than $1.8bn in the existing terminal.

The event was part of what has been touted by the administration as ※energy week§, although the week was instead dominated by the healthcare debate and the president＊s tweets about a TV host＊s face. ※America will be allowed to access the vast energy wealth located right off our shores,§ Trump said. ※And this is all just the beginning 每 believe me. The golden era of American energy is now under way. And I＊ll go a step further. The golden era of America is now under way. Believe me.§ Trump said the US had an ※extraordinary energy abundance§, including ※more than 250 years＊ worth of clean, beautiful coal§. This bounty had been neglected due to Obama-imposed restrictions, the president said, adding that sweeping away various regulations would bring about ※American energy dominance§. ※We will be dominant,§ said Trump, whose administration has lifted a ban on new coal mining on public land, crafted an executive order calling for more offshore drilling and approved the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. ※We will export American energy all over the world, all around the globe.§The president said he ※didn＊t take any heat§ over the pipeline approvals, despite subsequent climate-themed protest marches having attracted about . On Thursday, the state department  permits for the New Burgos pipeline, which will run close to Penitas, Texas, and cross the border into Mexico. Trump said the pipeline, which will deliver 108,000 barrels of refined petroleum a day, would ※go right under the wall, right?§ ※You know, a little like this,§ he added, with an undulating hand motion. Trump＊s speech, which did not mention climate change, was witnessed by an audience including the energy secretary, Rick Perry, and the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt. Both men have recently dismissed longstanding scientific understanding that carbon dioxide is a primary driver of global warming. Pruitt was part of the effort to persuade Trump to exit the Paris climate agreement and is in the process of rewriting the clean power plan. The fossil fuel industry welcomed Trump＊s speech. Jack Gerard, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, said it was ※critical§ that the US developed offshore oil and gas along all of its coastlines.  ※The US oil and natural gas industry has a long history of safe operations that have strengthened US energy security and contributed significantly to our nation＊s economy,§ Gerard said.  ※It＊s important that the next five-year plan includes the ability to explore our resources in the Arctic, Atlantic, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which would spur investment and economic activity, could create thousands of jobs, and provide billions in government revenue.§"

The  is also poised to resume vaccinating badgers in Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire this summer.Badgers have been trapped, injected with a vaccine and released by a growing number of wildlife groups as an alternative to England＊s badger cull, which .

Some scientists believe culling causes ※§, where badgers roam more widely, potentially spreading more bovine TB across the countryside.Derbyshire Wildlife Trust aim to vaccinate more than 100 badgers this year after so far vaccinating 30 badgers, including 12 cubs. They restarted their programme after the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust chair and veterinary surgeon, Dr Sue Mayer, secured the vaccine from a Canadian company.※Unicef now say all country needs for human TB vaccine can be met so we wanted to start vaccinating badgers as soon as we could,§ said Dr Mayer. ※Vaccination is a better solution than culling which research indicates can spread the disease further. It＊s also cheaper and avoids the indiscriminate killing of healthy animals.§Tim Birch, who is leading Derbyshire Wildlife Trust＊s vaccination effort, said the Trust was getting ※more and more landowners and farmers§ seeking to join their vaccination effort, rather than support badger culling.※Once farmers see we are reasonable people, they can work with us,§ said Birch. ※We＊re very resourceful and we＊ve built up a real expertise and, through word of mouth, people genuinely respect what we do. We＊ve been getting a lot of interest from farmers saying, ＆We don＊t like the idea of culling, we＊d like you to come on to our land and vaccinate badgers.＊§Derbyshire＊s vaccination programme is currently working with farmers and landowners and groups including the National Trust, the National Farmers Union and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA). Other vaccinators are also working alongside small but growing numbers of farmers: the Somerset Badger Group is vaccinating badgers on 10 commercial farms.An oral vaccine for badgers is still being developed by scientists and critics argue that trapping and injecting badgers is labour-intensive and expensive. But the Wildlife Trusts, which opposes the badger cull, believes it is cheaper than culling and highly effective. In 2014, 11 Wildlife Trusts delivered 317 doses of vaccine across 31.4km/sq of countryside at a cost of ?293 per dose. Volunteers receive government training to become qualified vaccinators, and 80 members of the public are assisting the Derbyshire programme. ※We＊re showing we can use a large number of enthusiastic volunteers and train them up and it＊s way, way cheaper than shooting badgers,§ said Birch. ※The number of enthusiastic volunteers who will do anything to join the programme is really inspiring.

"Biologists and bird watchers in  are closely monitoring a young red-tailed hawk that has 每 against all odds 每 been adopted into a nest full of bald eagles and is seemingly thriving after taking on eagle-like behaviour.The chick was first seen in the nest in British Columbia in early June, said biologists 每 possibly after one of the bald eagles raided a hawk＊s nest to provide food for their young. Surrounded by three eaglets and oblivious to his status as prey, the hawk probably began squawking for food, leading the bald eagles to begin feeding it as one of their own.※My guess is that this little guy begged loud and hard for food 每 not even thinking about the danger,§ David Bird of the  which has been monitoring the nest on Vancouver Island,  ※Food overrides everything in these birds.

Believed to be about three months old, the hawk has grown to full size and is in excellent health. The next few weeks will prove crucial to the hawk＊s development, said Bird, with biologists watching closely to see if he can figure out how to gather food on his own.The young hawk has been seen poking at seaweed close to the eagle nest 每 a typical foraging behaviour for bald eagles. But he＊s also been observed swooping to pick up pinecones and sticks, a behaviour often seen in young hawks as they hone the skills needed to hunt rodents and rabbits from high above.

It reminds us that, as part of this system, we are precious, too.Yet all around us is self-destruction. Senior doctors and health charities warn that  over the next five years, at a cost to the NHS of ?16.74bn. They are asking urgently for a crackdown on cheap alcohol and further restrictions on the advertising of booze, to at least help to avert the problem.The problem, however, seems existential to me.

Shock tactics follow a clear pattern: wait for a crisis (or even, in some instances, as in Chile or Russia, help foment one), declare a moment of what is sometimes called ※extraordinary politics§, suspend some or all democratic norms 每 and then ram the corporate wishlist through as quickly as possible. The research showed that virtually any tumultuous situation, if framed with sufficient hysteria by political leaders, could serve this softening-up function.

Amid hyperinflation or a banking collapse, for instance, the country＊s governing elites were frequently able to sell a panicked population on the necessity for attacks on social protections, or enormous bailouts to prop up the financial private sector 每 because the alternative, they claimed, was outright economic apocalypse.The Republicans under Donald Trump are already seizing the atmosphere of constant crisis that surrounds this presidency to push through as many unpopular, pro-corporate policies. And we know they would move much further and faster given an even bigger external shock. We know this because senior members of Trump＊s team have been at the heart of some of the most egregious examples of the shock doctrine in recent memory., the US secretary of state, has built his career in large part around taking advantage of the profitability of war and instability. ExxonMobil profited more than any oil major from the increase in the price of oil that was the result of . It also directly exploited the Iraq war to defy US state department advice and make , a move that, because it sidelined Iraq＊s central government, could well have sparked a full-blown civil war, and certainly did contribute to internal conflict.As CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson profited from disaster in other ways as well. As an executive at the fossil fuel giant, he spent his career working for a company that, despite its own scientists＊ research into the reality of human-caused climate change, decided to fund and spread misinformation and junk climate science. All the while, , ExxonMobil (both before and after Exxon and Mobil merged) worked diligently to figure out how to further profit from and protect itself against the very crisis on which it was casting doubt. It did so by exploring drilling in the Arctic (which was melting, thanks to climate change), redesigning a natural gas pipeline in the North Sea to accommodate rising sea levels and supercharged storms, and doing the same for a new rig off the coast of Nova Scotia.At a public event in 2012, Tillerson acknowledged that climate change was happening 每 but  was revealing: ※as a species§, humans have always adapted. ※So we will adapt to this. Changes to weather patterns that move crop production areas around 每 we＊ll adapt to that.§He＊s quite right: humans do adapt when their land ceases to produce food. The way humans adapt is by moving. They leave their homes and look for places to live where they can feed themselves and their families. But, as Tillerson well knows, we do not live at a time when countries gladly open their borders to hungry and desperate people. In fact, he now works for a president who has painted refugees from Syria 每 a country where  of the tensions that led to civil war 每 as Trojan horses for terrorism. A president who introduced a travel ban that has gone a long way towards barring Syrian migrants from entering the United States.A president who has said about Syrian children seeking asylum, ※I can look in their faces and say: ＆You can＊t come.＊§ A president who has not budged from that position even after he ordered missile strikes on Syria, supposedly moved by the horrifying impacts of a chemical weapon attack on Syrian children and ※beautiful babies§. (But not moved enough to welcome them and their parents.) A president who has announced plans to turn the tracking, surveillance, incarceration and  into a defining feature of his administration.Waiting in the wings, biding their time, are plenty of other members of the Trump team who have deep skills in profiting from all of that.etween election day and the end of Trump＊s first month in office, the stocks of the two largest private prison companies in the US, CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America) and the Geo Group, doubled, soaring by 140% and 98%, respectively. And why not? Just as Exxon learned to profit from climate change, these companies are part of the sprawling industry of private prisons, private security and private surveillance that sees wars and migration 每 both very often linked to climate stresses 每 as exciting and expanding market opportunities. In the US, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) incarcerates up to 34,000 immigrants thought to be in the country illegally on any given day, and 73% of them are held in private prisons. Little wonder, then, that these companies＊ stocks soared on Trump＊s election. And soon they had even more reasons to celebrate:  Trump＊s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, did was rescind the Obama administration＊s decision to move away from for-profit jails for the general prison population.Trump appointed as deputy defence secretary Patrick Shanahan, a top executive at Boeing who, at one point, was responsible for selling costly hardware to the US military, including Apache and Chinook helicopters. He also oversaw Boeing＊s ballistic missile defence programme 每 a part of the operation that stands to profit enormously if international tensions continue to escalate under Trump.And this is part of a much larger trend. As  in March 2017, ※President Donald Trump has weaponised the revolving door by appointing defence contractors and lobbyists to key government positions as he seeks to rapidly expand the military budget and homeland security programmes ＃ At least 15 officials with financial ties to defence contractors have been either nominated or appointed so far.§The revolving door is nothing new, of course. Retired military brass reliably take up jobs and contracts with weapons companies. What＊s new is the number of generals with lucrative ties to military contractors whom Trump has appointed to cabinet posts with the power to allocate funds 每 including those stemming from his plan to increase spending on the military, the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security by more than $80bn in just one year.The other thing that has changed is the size of the Homeland Security and surveillance industry. This sector grew exponentially after the September 11 attacks, when the Bush administration announced it was embarking on a never-ending ※war on terror§, and that everything that could be outsourced would be. New firms with tinted windows sprouted up like malevolent mushrooms around suburban Virginia, outside Washington DC, and existing ones, such as Booz Allen Hamilton, expanded into brand new territories. , Daniel Gross captured the mood of what many called the security bubble: ※Homeland security may have just reached the stage that internet investing hit in 1997. Back then, all you needed to do was put an ＆e＊ in front of your company name and your IPO would rocket. Now you can do the same with ＆fortress＊.§That means many of Trump＊s appointees come from firms that specialise in functions that, not so long ago, it would have been unthinkable to outsource. His National Security Council chief of staff, for instance, is retired Lt Gen Keith Kellogg. Among the many jobs Kellogg has had with security contractors since going private was one with Cubic Defense.According to the company, he led ※our ground combat training business and focus[ed] on expanding the company＊s worldwide customer base§. If you think ※combat training§ is something armies used to do all on their own, you＊d be right.One noticeable thing about Trump＊s contractor appointees is how many of them come from firms that did not even exist before 9/11: L-1 Identity Solutions (specialising in biometrics), the Chertoff Group (founded by George W Bush＊s homeland security director Michael Chertoff),  (a surveillance/big data firm cofounded by PayPal billionaire and Trump backer ), and many more. Security firms draw heavily on the military and intelligence wings of government for their staffing.Under Trump, lobbyists and staffers from these firms are now migrating back to government, where they will very likely push for even more opportunities to monetise the hunt for people Trump likes to call ※bad hombres§.This creates a disastrous cocktail. Take a group of people who directly profit from ongoing war and then put those same people at the heart of government. Who＊s going to make the case for peace? Indeed, the idea that a war could ever definitively end seems a quaint relic of what during the Bush years was dismissed as ※pre每September 11 thinking§.nd then there＊s vice-president , seen by many as the grownup in Trump＊s messy room. Yet it is Pence, the former governor of Indiana, who actually has the most disturbing track record when it comes to bloody-minded exploitation of human suffering.When Mike Pence was announced as Donald Trump＊s running mate, I thought to myself: I know that name, I＊ve seen it somewhere. And then I remembered. He was at the heart of one of the most shocking stories I＊ve ever covered: the disaster capitalism free-for-all that followed Katrina and the drowning of . Mike Pence＊s doings as a profiteer from human suffering are so appalling that they are worth exploring in a little more depth, since they tell us a great deal about what we can expect from this administration during times of heightened crisis.Before we delve into Pence＊s role, what＊s important to remember about Hurricane Katrina is that, though it is usually described as a ※natural disaster§, there was nothing natural about the way it affected the city of New Orleans. When Katrina hit the coast of Mississippi in August 2005, it had been downgraded from a category 5 to a still-devastating category 3 hurricane. But by the time it made its way to New Orleans, it had lost most of its strength and been downgraded again, to a ※tropical storm§.That＊s relevant, because a tropical storm should never have broken through New Orleans＊s flood defence. Katrina did break through, however, because the levees that protect the city did not hold. Why? We now know that despite repeated warnings about the risk, the army corps of engineers had allowed the levees to fall into a state of disrepair. That failure was the result of two main factors.One was a specific disregard for the lives of poor black people, whose homes in the  were left most vulnerable by the failure to fix the levees. This was part of a wider neglect of public infrastructure, which is the direct result of decades of neoliberal policy. Because when you systematically wage war on the very idea of the public sphere and the public good, of course the publicly owned bones of society 每 roads, bridges, levees, water systems 每 are going to slip into a state of such disrepair that it takes little to push them beyond the breaking point. When you massively cut taxes so that you don＊t have money to spend on much of anything besides the police and the military, this is what happens.It wasn＊t just the physical infrastructure that failed the city, and particularly its poorest residents, who are, as in so many US cities, overwhelmingly African American. The human systems of disaster response also failed 每 the second great fracturing. The arm of the federal government that is tasked with responding to moments of national crisis such as this is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), with state and municipal governments also playing key roles in evacuation planning and response. All levels of government failed.It took Fema five days to get water and food to people in New Orleans who had sought emergency shelter in the Superdome. The most harrowing images from that time were of  每 of homes and hospitals 每 holding up signs that said ※HELP§, watching the helicopters pass them by. People helped each other as best they could. They rescued each other in canoes and rowboats. They fed each other. They displayed that beautiful human capacity for solidarity that moments of crisis so often intensify. But at the official level, it was the complete opposite. I＊ll always remember the words of Curtis Muhammad, a longtime New Orleans civil rights organiser, who said this experience ※convinced us that we had no caretakers§.The way this abandonment played out was deeply unequal, and the divisions cleaved along lines of race and class. Many people were able to leave the city on their own 每 they got into their cars, drove to a dry hotel, called their insurance brokers. Some people stayed because they believed the storm defences would hold. But a great many others stayed because they had no choice 每 they didn＊t have a car, or were too infirm to drive, or simply didn＊t know what to do. Those are the people who needed a functioning system of evacuation and relief 每 and they were out of luck.Abandoned in the city without food or water, those in need did what anyone would do in those circumstances: they took provisions from local stores. Fox News and other media outlets seized on this to paint New Orleans＊s black residents as dangerous ※looters§ who would soon be coming to invade the dry, white parts of the city and surrounding suburbs and towns. Buildings were spray-painted with messages: ※Looters will be shot.§Checkpoints were set up to trap people in the flooded parts of town. On Danziger Bridge,  on sight (five of the officers involved ultimately pleaded guilty, and the city came to a $13.3m settlement with the families in that case and two other similar post-Katrina cases). Meanwhile, gangs of armed white vigilantes prowled the streets looking, as one resident later put it in an expos谷 by , for ※the opportunity to hunt black people§. was in New Orleans during the flooding and I saw for myself how amped up the police and military were 每 not to mention private security guards from companies such as Blackwater who were showing up fresh from Iraq. It felt very much like a war zone, with poor and black people in the crosshairs 每 people whose only crime was trying to survive. By the time the National Guard arrived to organise a full evacuation of the city, it was done with a level of aggression and ruthlessness that was hard to fathom. Soldiers pointed machine guns at residents as they boarded buses, providing no information about where they were being taken. Children were often separated from their parents.What I saw during the flooding shocked me. But what I saw in the aftermath of Katrina shocked me even more. With the city reeling, and with its residents dispersed across the country and unable to protect their own interests, a plan emerged to ram through a pro-corporate wishlist with maximum velocity. The famed free-market economist Milton Friedman, then 93 years old, wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal stating, ※Most New Orleans schools are in ruins, as are the homes of the children who have attended them. The children are now scattered all over the country. This is a tragedy. It is also an opportunity to radically reform the educational system.§In a similar vein, Richard Baker, at that time a Republican congressman from Louisiana, declared, ※We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans. We couldn＊t do it, but God did.§ I was in an evacuation shelter near Baton Rouge when Baker made that statement. The people I spoke with were just floored by it. Imagine being forced to leave your home, having to sleep in a camping bed in some cavernous convention centre, and then finding out that the people who are supposed to represent you are claiming this was some sort of divine intervention 每 God apparently really likes condo developments.Baker got his ※cleanup§ of public housing. In the months after the storm, with New Orleans＊s residents 每 and all their inconvenient opinions, rich culture and deep attachments 每 out of the way, thousands of public housing units, many of which had sustained minimal storm damage because they were on high ground, were demolished. They were replaced with condos and town houses priced far out of reach for most who had lived there.And this is where Mike Pence enters the story. At the time Katrina hit New Orleans, Pence was chairman of the powerful and highly ideological Republican Study Committee (RSC), a caucus of conservative lawmakers. On 13 September 2005 每 just 15 days after the levees were breached, and with parts of New Orleans still under water 每 the RSC convened a fateful meeting at the offices of the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC. Under Pence＊s leadership, the group came up with a list of ※§ 每 32 pseudo-relief policies in all, each one straight out of the disaster capitalism playbook.What stands out is the commitment to wage all-out war on labour standards and the public sphere 每 which is bitterly ironic, because the failure of public infrastructure is what turned Katrina into a human catastrophe in the first place. Also notable is the determination to use any opportunity to strengthen the hand of the oil and gas industry. The list includes recommendations to suspend the obligation for federal contractors to pay a living wage; make the entire affected area a free-enterprise zone; and ※repeal or waive restrictive environmental regulations ＃ that hamper rebuilding§. In other words, a war on the kind of red tape designed to keep communities safe from harm.President Bush adopted many of the recommendations within the week, although, under pressure, he was eventually forced to reinstate the labour standards. Another recommendation called for giving parents vouchers to use at private and charter schools (for-profit schools subsidised with tax dollars), a move perfectly in line with the vision held by Trump＊s pick for education secretary, . Within the year, the New Orleans school system became the most privatised in the US.And there was more. Though climate scientists have directly linked the increased intensity of hurricanes to warming ocean temperatures, that didn＊t stop Pence and his committee from calling on Congress to repeal environmental regulations on the Gulf coast, give permission for new oil refineries in the US, and green-light ※drilling in the §.It＊s a kind of madness. After all, these very measures are a surefire way to drive up greenhouse gas emissions, the major human contributor to climate change, which leads to fiercer storms. Yet they were immediately championed by Pence, and later adopted by Bush, under the guise of responding to a devastating hurricane.It＊s worth pausing to tease out the implications of all of this. Hurricane Katrina turned into a catastrophe in New Orleans because of a combination of extremely heavy weather 每 possibly linked to climate change 每 and weak and neglected public infrastructure. The so-called solutions proposed by the group Pence headed at the time were the very things that would inevitably exacerbate climate change and weaken public infrastructure even further. He and his fellow ※free-market§ travellers were determined, it seems, to do the very things that are guaranteed to lead to more Katrinas in the future.And now  is in a position to bring this vision to the entire United States.he oil industry wasn＊t the only one to profit from Hurricane Katrina. Immediately after the storm, the whole gang of contractors who had descended on Baghdad when war broke out 每 Bechtel, Fluor, Halliburton, Blackwater, CH2M Hill and Parsons, infamous for  每 now arrived in New Orleans. They had a singular vision: to prove that the kinds of privatised services they had been providing in Iraq and Afghanistan also had an ongoing domestic market 每 and to collect no-bid contracts totalling $3.4bn.The controversies were legion. Relevant experience often appeared to have nothing to do with how contracts were allocated. Take, for example, the company that Fema paid $5.2m to perform the crucial role of building a base camp for emergency workers in St Bernard Parish, a suburb of New Orleans. The camp construction fell behind schedule and was never completed. Under investigation, it emerged that the contractor, Lighthouse Disaster Relief, was in fact a religious group. ※About the closest thing I have done to this is just organise a youth camp with my church,§ confessed Lighthouse＊s director, Pastor Gary Heldreth.After all the layers of subcontractors had taken their cut, there was next to nothing left for the people doing the work. Author Mike Davis tracked the way Fema paid Shaw $175 per sq ft to install blue tarps on damaged roofs, even though the tarps themselves were provided by the government. Once all the subcontractors took their share, the workers who actually hammered in the tarps were paid as little as $2 per sq ft.※Every level of the contracting food chain, in other words, is grotesquely overfed except the bottom rung,§ Davis wrote, ※where the actual work is carried out.§ These supposed ※contractors§ were really 每 like the Trump Organization 每 hollow brands, sucking out profit and then slapping their name on cheap or non-existent services.In order to offset the tens of billions going to private companies in contracts and tax breaks, in November 2005 the Republican-controlled Congress announced that it needed to cut $40bn from the federal budget. Among the programmes that were slashed: student loans, Medicaid and food stamps.So, the poorest people in the US subsidised the contractor bonanza twice: first, when Katrina relief morphed into unregulated corporate handouts, providing neither decent jobs nor functional public services; and second, when the few programmes that assist the unemployed and working poor nationwide were gutted to pay those bloated bills.New Orleans is the disaster capitalism blueprint 每 designed by the current vice-president and by the Heritage Foundation, the hard-right think tank to which Trump has outsourced much of his administration＊s budgeting. Ultimately, the response to Katrina sparked an approval ratings freefall for George W Bush, a plunge that eventually lost the Republicans the presidency in 2008. Nine years later, with Republicans now in control of Congress and the White House, it＊s not hard to imagine this test case for privatised disaster response being adopted on a national scale.The presence of highly militarised police and armed private soldiers in New Orleans came as a surprise to many. Since then, the phenomenon has expanded exponentially, with local police forces across the country outfitted to the gills with military-grade gear, including tanks and drones, and private security companies frequently providing training and support. Given the array of private military and security contractors occupying key positions in the Trump administration, we can expect all of this to expand further with each new shock.The Katrina experience also stands as a stark warning to those who are holding out hope for Trump＊s promised $1tn in infrastructure spending. That spending will fix some roads and bridges, and it will create jobs. Crucially, Trump has indicated that he plans to do as much as possible not through the public sector but through public-private partnerships 每 which have a terrible track record for corruption, and may result in far lower wages than true public-works projects would. Given Trump＊s business record, and Pence＊s role in the administration, there is every reason to fear that his big-ticket infrastructure spending could become a Katrina-like kleptocracy, a government of thieves, with the Mar-a-Lago set helping themselves to .New Orleans provides a harrowing picture of what we can expect when the next shock hits. But sadly, it is far from complete: there is much more that this administration might try to push through under cover of crisis. To become shock-resistant, we need to prepare for that, too.

"It is one of the more neglected dimensions of the badger cull, but one that could reignite the controversy surrounding the attempt to control the spread of bovine tuberculosis.Conservationists have long claimed that eliminating badgers from certain areas is likely to trigger an increase in other predators, such as foxes, leading to serious consequences for species and habitats. But the government has refused to publish data showing what impact the cull is having on local ecosystems for fear that the results will be used by animal rights activists to identify the farmers and landowners carrying out the extermination.Now, following a three-year battle, the Information Commissioner＊s Office has told Natural England 每 the government＊s adviser on the natural environment 每 to provide the analysis within weeks or risk ending up in the high court. The ruling will also have significant consequences for the other information that the body is withholding on the grounds of public safety, conservationists predict.A recent report for the Welsh assembly would see numbers of other predators 每 such as foxes, stoats and weasels 每 increase, something that could have a negative impact on ground-nesting birds, notably the chough, a member of the crow family. Research sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and published in 2007 suggested that ※badger culling ＃ is likely to result in markedly higher fox densities. This raises issues relating to the costs of predation on livestock and game, the ecological impact of foxes in conservation terms as predators of ground-nesting birds and hares, and risks to public health as potential vectors of rabies§.In 2011, ahead of pilot culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, the government＊s that ※removing or reintroducing a dominant predator in any ecosystem may have a widespread impact upon a wildlife community, and that the impact is hard to predict§.It called on the government to conduct proper analysis, but Natural England has until now refused to release the analysis, telling the information commissioner that disclosure ※of the withheld information will lead to a materially increased risk of landowners ＃ being victims of intimidation, harassment and criminal damage§. The commissioner has now decided that these fears are insufficient grounds for withholding the information.※This opens the floodgates to a whole range of issues, not just about the cull＊s impact on other predators, but other information it is withholding relating to cost, scientific validity and monitoring,§ said Dominic Dyer, chief executive of the Badger Trust. ※Tens of thousands of badgers are being targeted across the country in a blind cull where no badgers are being tested for TB and where we have very little information on the ecological impact of their removal.§The ruling could be embarrassing for the new Defra secretary, Michael Gove. A failure to have conducted the analysis will trigger a torrent of criticism from both sides. Since the badger cull started six years ago,  to Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, Herefordshire and Wiltshire and is likely to be introduced in Cheshire and Derbyshire later this year. Last year  as part of the cull.The National Farmers Union believes the cull, which needs to kill 70% of the badger population in the targeted areas to be effective, is key to controlling and eradicating bovine TB, the spread of which led to the slaughter of more than 29,000 cattle in England in 2016, with around . Farmers say the disease has cost the taxpayer ?500m in England in the past decade and that this will rise to ?1bn over the next 10 years.But Dyer said that the government was sitting on key data that suggested the cull was not working: ※If you look at the cull zones and the surrounding areas there is .§A failure to have conducted an impact assessment would be a breach of the Bern convention on . As a result, the UK government could see itself dragged through the courts.Dyer added: ※If we find that the government has not done a proper ecological assessment on removing the badgers, it could lead to a challenge under the?convention.§A spokeswoman for Natural England said: ※We are considering the [information commissioner＊s] decision.§The ruling comes amid claims the UK＊s badger population of half a million is under threat. An estimated 50,000 badgers are being killed on the roads each year and as many as 30,000 more could be culled by October."																																																			
"Theresa May will raise the issue of climate change with  this weekend when the pair meet for the first time since she lost her majority in the general election. They will talk at the G20 summit in Hamburg, which runs on Friday and Saturday.The two leaders will hold a formal bilateral meeting, at which the prime minister plans to tell the US president she does not believe the  needs to be renegotiated.Trump caused consternation worldwide last month when he confirmed that he wanted to  from the pact.May was  for not signing a letter sent by several European governments condemning the move 每 though she insisted she had discussed it with him directly.But a senior government official said the prime minister would be ※stressing that the UK remains fully committed to the Paris agreement. She will say that we don＊t see any need for renegotiation 每 we support the Paris agreement because it delivers.§May and Trump are also expected to discuss this week＊s , with the prime minister stressing that it is essential the international community is united in condemnation of North Korea＊s actions.Barry Gardiner, Labour＊s shadow cabinet minister dealing with climate change, called for a more robust approach on climate, saying the prime minister should ※take President Trump to task§ for his announcement that the US will quit the international accord to address dangerous global warming.Gardiner said: ※A Labour prime minister would make clear that the UK stands by the Paris agreement and that America is diminished by the president＊s foolish and shortsighted decision to withdraw.§May and Trump＊s last face-to-face meeting was at the G7 in Sicily, in an unscheduled ※pull aside§ in which Downing street said they ※reaffirmed their commitment to increasing trade between the UK and the US, including a post-Brexit trade deal§.The prime minister was later criticised for failing to sign up to a joined up statement from the G7＊s EU leaders 每 Germany＊s Angela Merkel, France＊s Emmanuel Macron and Italy＊s Paolo Gentiloni 每 saying the Paris accord could not be renegotiated.The trio said: ※We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies.§Downing Street stressed that the UK had responded in a normal way to the situation, and that the other G7 countries, Canada and Japan, had not signed up to the statement either.  Since May＊s last meeting with Trump the US president caused anger in the UK by , Sadiq Khan, following the London bridge terror attack last month.Trump castigated Khan on Twitter, saying the mayor had said there was ※no reason to be alarmed§ by the attack. Khan had in fact said this about the increased and armed police presence in London after the attack.Trump had been due to hold a state visit to the UK over the summer, which was set to be dogged by mass protests. However, this appears to have been indefinitely put back,  he did not want to make the trip if the British public did not support him.While Downing Street has insisted the plans have not changed, Trump＊s arrival was not mentioned in last month＊s Queen＊s speech, as is normal for state visits, indicating has not been fixed for the two-year period covered by the address."																																																			
"nvention is the mother of necessity, warned Thorstein Veblen. So packaged water is now seen as essential by many, and  worldwide, as the Guardian series  has revealed. In the UK, consumers pay . But the true cost is not to our pockets. Most of these bottles are not recycled; instead we waste energy, choke landfill sites and contaminate our seas. By 2050 the ocean will contain more plastic than fish, research suggests. Marine life is suffering, and perhaps human health too as minute pieces of plastic end up on our plates.This is a global problem and the answers will vary accordingly. But the essentials are: using fewer bottles, recycling those that are consumed, and ensuring new bottles contain more recycled material. Clean and readily available tap water is needed 每 particularly important in Asia, which is leading the surge in use 每 and pressure on producers. Consumers, as well as government and business, have their part to play. Simple measures can have a striking impact: the UK＊s 5p tax on plastic bags has led to an estimated 80% fall in use. No great inventiveness is needed. And tackling our plastic addiction is?unquestionably necessary."																																																			
"Not many of the 25 million people enjoying the sea breeze on a cruise ship this year are likely to think about the air pollutants being emitted from the vessel.Mostly running on heavy fuel oil, a medium-sized cruise ship produces around the same volume of air pollutants 每 including greenhouse gases, sulphur, nitric oxides and particulate matter 每 as  going the same distance, estimates the German environmental NGO Nabu.※The standards for the shipping industry are really low compared to what we can see in road transport,§ says Dietmar Oeliger, head of environmental policy at Nabu. ※For a long time, politics served it well. People didn＊t care about emissions on open water.§ Most countries devolve responsibility for regulating the industry to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), says Tristan Smith, shipping and climate change expert at University College London. He adds that many smaller countries do not have the resources to regulate it themselves and some choose not to restrict it 每 after all, the industry is a boon to local economies, bringing in tourists and providing jobs.New  coming into force in 2020 will require cruise ships to reduce their sulphur emissions from 3.5% to 0.5%. In order to comply with the limit, several cruise companies have installed scrubber technology on their ships, which uses seawater to wash the exhausts. While this reduces sulphur in the air, it puts it into the water instead, says Oeliger. ※You take one problem away, but create another.§A better alternative would be to install emission abatement technology, like in road vehicles, and switch from heavy fuel oil to cleaner marine or road diesel, or liquefied natural gas (LNG), says Oeliger.Several companies have already invested in LNG powered ships. Royal Caribbean Cruises will be introducing its first fleet of LNG ships in 2022 and is investing in fuel cell technology, which converts chemicals into electricity. Carnival Group, which owns Aida and the P&O lines, has .But LNG is not without problems. Smith explains that LNG is a high carbon fuel that only makes a marginal CO2 reduction for ships. ※In a decarbonising world, there is no place for LNG as more than a short-term transition marine fuel, and it will need to be replaced by genuine low carbon fuels,§ he said. Alternative energy sources such as renewables and biofuels, as well as battery-powered ships, could be a better solution and some companies have started to explore these avenues. Cruise liner Hurtigruten has ordered a pair of , which will use a battery system to power them. Color Line has also announced plans for a battery powered . Ports in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego also allow ships to plug into the mains when docked, reducing air pollution for residents, though the lack of an international standard plug and high infrastructure costs presents a barrier to mass rollout. Meanwhile Finish cruise company Viking Line is exploring wind power, having partnered with energy company Norsepower to install a  on an LNG-powered ship, helping to cut emissions. As well as reducing fuel consumption and emissions, Fabian Lundgren, project manager and marine superintendent at Viking Line, believes the investment will give the company a competitive advantage. ※In northern Europe, everyone is thinking about environment, so this is also a good push for our marketing 每 I think people will choose us maybe because of the rotor sails,§ he says.But the cost of investing in green technology is high for shipping companies, Lundgren adds, and if companies are forced to move too fast to meet legislation, ※you can kill the cruise industry§.With oil prices low and competition in the market fierce, campaigners warn that cruise companies＊ environmental efforts are too limited. Marcie Keever, oceans and vessels programme director at Friends of the Earth, warns that despite companies＊ sustainability pledges, ※bad behaviour§ still occurs.In December 2016, for example, Princess Cruises was fined a record US$40m (?33m) after it was found guilty of illegally  and covering it up. Likewise Aida, the Carnival cruise line which  as an environmentally conscious company, has been , despite the NGO giving it the top spot in its annual cruise ship rankings. There is a huge opportunity for cruise companies to improve their environmental policies and introduce more clean technology, says Oeliger. Curbing pollution is not just an environmental issue but directly impacts passenger wellbeing too, he adds. ※[Cruise companies] are not shipping containers, they are shipping passengers, and they are responsible for their health,§ he says."																																																			
"Scientists in Canada have been forced to abandon an expedition to the Hudson Bay to research the impact of , after warming temperatures created perilous ice conditions off the coast of Newfoundland.In late May, 40 scientists from five Canadian universities set off from Quebec City on the icebreaker and Arctic research vessel CCGS Amundsen. The expedition was the first leg of a  designed to delve into the effects of climate change on Hudson Bay. The icebreaker was soon diverted. Dense ice 每 up to 8 metres (25ft) thick 每 had filled the waters off the northern coast of Newfoundland, trapping fishing boats and ferries. ※It was a really dramatic situation,§ said David Barber, the expedition＊s chief scientist. ※We were getting search and rescue calls from fishing boats that were stranded in the ice and tankers that were stranded trying to get fuel into the communities. Nobody could manage this ice because it was far too heavy to get through.§Barber, a climate change scientist at the University of Manitoba, and the other scientists did what they could to help the Coast Guard rescue the vessels and carved a path for the tankers. They also took the time to study the ice that surrounded them, discovering that much of it was the multiyear ice typically seen in the high Arctic.It was an unexpected find, said Barber, given the time of year and how far south they were. ※It＊s not something you would expect to see there and not something we＊ve seen there before,§ he said. ※In the high Arctic, climate change is causing the ice to get thinner and there to be less of it. What that does is that it increases the mobility of ice.§The decision to cancel the first leg of the expedition was made after it became clear that continuing north would interrupt search and rescue operations and probably put lives at risk. The irony was not lost on Barber. ※We＊re doing a large-scale climate change study and before we can even get going on it, climate change is conspiring to force us to cancel that study.§ The decision was a costly one, as the project had already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting the scientists and their gear on the vessel. The next leg of the expedition, scheduled to start on 6 July, is expected to go ahead, but the study will probably need to be extended by at least six months and may require more funding, he said. ※It＊s a real mess.§ Barber 每 who has spent decades researching the impact of climate change on sea ice 每 described his week spent on the frontlines of battling a changing climate as a stark reminder of the reality the world is facing. ※We＊re very poorly prepared for climate change,§ he said. ※We pay lip service to the fact that we think we know it＊s coming and society is trying to grapple with the complexity of it, but when it really comes down to brass tacks, our systems are ill prepared for it.§"																																																			
																																																			
"Miguel G車mez Garza was on his final expedition to the Yucat芍n Peninsula to gather information for his book Parrots of  when it happened. He heard a group of parrots in the distance, but their call was like none on record. So he loitered by a tree full of pods that parrots like for lunch, hoping they would come and feed.The wait was worth it. When half a dozen parrots flew over to the tree, G車mez Garza noticed their intense red fronts and the beautiful blue tips on their wing feathers. The plumage set them apart from the two species known to live in the area, which both have distinctive white fronts. ※I could not believe it. The different noise belonged to a different parrot,§ said G車mez Garza, a vet and ornithologist at the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le車n in Monterrey, Mexico.In research published on Tuesday, an international team of scientists describe the new parrot for the first time. Named the blue-winged Amazon parrot, or  in honour of its discoverer, the bird stands 25cm or so tall and has a loud, short and repetitive call that would not sound out of place on the soundtrack to .One of the calls the bird makes imitates that of the hawk, a natural enemy of parrots. While scientists are not sure why the parrot mimics the predator, they speculate that it scares other birds from the surrounding trees, leaving more seeds, fruit and flowers for the parrots to eat.Having spotted the birds in their habitat, G車mez Garza got permission from the Mexican authorities to capture a male and a female for further study. With help from Tony Silva at the University of Florida and Pawel Mackiewicz at the University of Wroclaw, he measured the animals and collected feather and blood samples.Tests on the parrot DNA described in the journal  show that the new species evolved from the white-fronted parrots () that were native to the region about 120,000 years ago. Given their rarity, the tests were performed without harming the parrots. ※I believe this is the first time in recent history that a scientific description has been done without having to terminate its life,§ G車mez Garza said. He added that plans are already being drawn up to protect the species.Mackiewicz said that there were probably no more than 100 blue-winged Amazon parrots in existence, making their conservation a priority.※Globally, parrots face habitat destruction,§ said G車mez Garza. ※The international illegal trade is not as alarming as it was a few years ago, but continues locally with some species. Awareness will be the turning point in saving wild parrots around the world.§"																																																			
"Electricity prices paid by households are about to rapidly increase and the single person who is probably most responsible is Tony Abbott.It has been claimed that in a party room meeting Tuesday afternoon, Abbott was interjecting while Craig Laundy was speaking in favour of a clean energy target. Shouting slogans while someone talks policy is a fitting metaphor for Abbott＊s contribution to the climate change debate.The Finkel report highlights what is currently wrong in Australia＊s energy policy: there isn＊t one. We haven＊t had an effective energy policy since Abbott abolished the carbon price and replaced it with nothing. The result of this has been a lack of investment certainty.This shouldn＊t come as a shock to anyone. It＊s what experts were warning about for years. A failure to tackle climate change will have higher costs in the long run. But it seems that when it comes to energy policy, ignoring experts is what Australia does.Electricity prices have jumped almost 20% in some states, with many others soon to follow. Even before these increases, electricity prices are higher now than when the carbon price was in place.This is the unfortunate price that we pay when we listen to self-interested politicians and ignore experts.You might think that this all has to do with climate change. But while climate change is important, the increase in electricity prices would have happened even if we lived in the fantasy world where climate change doesn＊t exist.Why? Because there is a technological transformation happening in energy, and much like the horse and cart, the VHS cassette and photo development labs, coal is about to be pushed out of the market by something better and cheaper.While you might be able to find those who cling to the past and try and convince people that coal still has a future, it is telling that none of them are investors in electricity generation. Those who have to come up with the money and take the risk are all uninterested in investing in coal.If you want to build a new coal plant you have to think about what is going to happen to electricity prices over the next 20 or 30 years, because that is the time frame that you have to sell over to make back the cost of building the plant.The reality is that renewables and storage is going to be much cheaper than coal in far less than 20 years, so anyone building a coal plant today is never going to make back their money.The problem Australia has is that right at the changeover point when energy production is shifting from fossil fuel to renewables and storage, we have a bunch of very large, very old coal fired plants coming to the end of their working lives.Anyone who has owned an old car knows that there comes a point when maintaining and repairing it just isn＊t worth it anymore. So it is with our ageing coal fired power stations.After the abolition of the carbon price by Abbott and Hunt there was a drought in investment in new generation, including for renewables. Renewables had previously been pushing additional generation into the market. According to many studies, including Mr Abbott＊s own review, renewables were putting downward pressure on electricity prices.Along with the withdrawal of ageing coal assets, the lack of investment in new generation slowly built pressure in the market. The final result was a rapid rise in wholesale electricity prices, a rise that is going to be increasingly felt by Australian consumers.These kinds of problems are very solvable, and all it needs is political leadership and a sensible energy policy. Instead Australia got political self interest in the form of Abbott and the abolition of astute policy.The market for electricity is not the only part of energy policy where we have ignored the experts. We have also had a massive fail when it comes to natural gas.Gas on the east coast of Australia until recently was relatively cheap. In order to increase the price the gas industry has built three large export facilities. This linked the east coast gas price with the world price. The effect was to massively increase the price paid by Australian consumers.Governments were warned well in advance that this increase in gas prices was coming. Yet nothing was done. There appears to have been no consideration by state and federal governments about the impact these higher gas prices would have on industry or electricity prices. Instead governments happily waved through approval of the export facilities.For the last four years energy policy in Australia has been a fact free zone of bad politics and no interest in understanding the issue. The biggest losers are electricity consumers. It is long past time for the government to reengage with experts and start ignoring self-interested politicians.This is not to say that we should blindly listen to experts. There are many good democratic reasons why it might be appropriate to ignore the experts. But if this is the case, people should be able to expect that politicians can clearly explain those reasons. Whyalla being wiped out and  are not sufficient explanations.When you open your electricity bill and it＊s gone up, think of Tony Abbott and the policy instability he helped create."																																																			
" is responsible for one in four deaths among all children under five, according to new World Health Organisation reports, with toxic air, unsafe water, and and lack of sanitation the leading causes.The  found polluted environments cause the deaths of 1.7 million children every year, but that many of the deaths could be prevented by interventions already known to work, such as providing cleaner cooking fuels to prevent indoor air pollution.※A polluted environment is a deadly one, particularly for young children,§ said Dr Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO. ※Their developing organs and immune systems 每 and smaller bodies and airways 每 make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water.§ The harm from air pollution can begin in the womb and increase the risk of premature birth. After birth, air pollution raises the risk of pneumonia, a major cause of death for under fives, and of lifelong lung conditions such as asthma. It may also increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer in later life.The reports present a comprehensive review of the effect of unhealthy environments and found that 570,000 children under five years old die each year from respiratory infections such as pneumonia, while another 361,000 die due to diarrhoea, as a result of polluted water and poor access to sanitation.The WHO estimates that 11% to 14% of children aged five years and older currently report asthma symptoms, with almost half of these cases related to air pollution. It also suggests that the warmer temperatures and carbon dioxide levels linked to climate change may increase pollen levels, making asthma worse.※Investing in the removal of environmental risks to health will result in massive health benefits,§ said Dr Maria Neira, WHO director of environmental and social determinants of health. For example, tackling the backyard recycling of electrical waste would cut children＊s exposure to toxins which can cause reduced intelligence and cancer. In October, the UN＊s children＊s agency Unicef made the  and found that almost 90% 每 2 billion children 每 live in places where outdoor air pollution exceeds WHO limits. It found that 300 million of these children live in areas with extreme air pollution, where toxic fumes are more than six times above the health guidelines.The WHO announced in May that , with virtually all cities in poorer nations blighted by unhealthy air and more than half of those in richer countries also suffering.Research in 2015 revealed that more than 3 million people a year die early because of outdoor air pollution, .  on Monday that air pollution is ※one of the most pernicious threats§ facing global public health today and is on a much bigger scale than HIV or Ebola."																																																			
																																																			
"ar out on Delhi＊s southern and eastern fringes the rows of high-rises suddenly turn skeletal. The population of the Indian capital, already the  by 9 million in the next 15 years; and despite  in new projects, areas such as Noida are a universe of worksites, cranes and workers.The empty towers stretch as far as can be seen 每 which is only about 300 metres. Like much of  on most winter mornings, Noida is blanketed in thick smog and a heavy dust that cakes windows and clogs throats.A comprehensive 2016 study of what is to blame for Delhi＊s poor air identified some obvious sources,such as car emissions, the city＊s coal-fired power stations and rubbish fires both small and . But it also highlighted more unlikely culprits. Dust kicked up by cars along Delhi＊s vast and growing road network contributes between a third and 56% of the most harmful pollutants in the city＊s atmosphere.The city＊s construction sites, and the production of the raw materials that feed them 每 such as bricks and concrete 每 are also an outsized contributor to the foul air that some lung specialists warn is making Delhi hazardous, particularly for children and the elderly.In a country largely under construction 每 by some rough projections,  of the buildings that will exist in India＊s cities by 2030 are yet to be built 每 controlling the dust produced by roads and worksites is an important, but largely neglected, part of clearing Delhi＊s air, according to environmental groups.Landlocked by treeless plains and deserts, Delhi is inherently dusty. ※It＊s one of the reasons we can＊t have air quality standards as strict or high as the US,§ says Sarath Guttikunda, the founder of , an air pollution research group. ※Our annual standard for PM2.5 pollutants is 40 units, but the World Health Organization＊s guideline is 10.§But poor building standards and antiquated practices, multiplied across thousands of worksites, make construction and demolition the third-largest contributor of coarse pollutants 每 strongly linked  to heart disease.At one building site in Chittaranjan Park, an affluent south Delhi neighbourhood, half-covered piles of rubble spill out on to the pavement. No fences have been erected to keep the wind from whipping dust out into the street. Enormous mounds of dirt left in empty lots, or simply dumped at the roadside, are also a common sight.※The Indian construction contractor is trying to maximise his margins,§ says Polash Mukherjee, a researcher with the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment. ※If he＊s constructing his house, he＊s not required to go to a facility by law and dispose of the waste. Unless he＊s forced by government to cover his trucks when he transport raw materials, he won＊t do it.§Builders aren＊t just cutting corners: Delhi simply lacks the capacity to safely process the amount of construction waste it produces. A senior environmental engineer at the Delhi  Control Committee told the Guardian current facilities allow for about 1,000 tonnes of waste to be processed per day, but the city produces an estimated 3,600 tonnes.Run-of-the-mill construction activities take a hefty toll. The process of mixing concrete alone, for example, is estimated to contribute 10% of the coarse pollutants in Delhi＊s air, according to an Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur study. Less polluting methods of producing concrete exist, but cost money. ※Here it＊s often mixed in a pit by manual labour,§ says Mukherjee. ※It＊s cheaper that way, because there＊s such a surplus of labour.§A 2015 study of 19 large Delhi construction sites found the air quality around all of them exceeded safe limits by at least three times, with workers on these sites, mostly daily wage labourers, bearing the brunt. Almost none wear pollution masks, while a handful tie handkerchiefs across their faces to guard against the dust. Naresh Sharma, a cook on a site in Greater Noida, said workers were sometimes issued pieces of jaggery, a concoction of sugarcane and date palm believed to clear the throat and lungs. ※It clears your throat from phlegm, but I don＊t think it prevents damage,§ says Sai Kiran Chaudhari, a leading pulmonologist at the Delhi Heart and Lung Hospital.Two years ago, India＊s environment court issued extensive regulations to clean up the city＊s construction industry, mandating 50,000 rupee (?595) fines for builders who failed to cover their sites in tarpaulin, put up barriers, or sprinkle building materials with water before they were stored or transported. But Mukherjee says construction in Delhi is administered according to complex rules by numerous authorities, and in any case, ※enforcement is very, very lax§.Delhi itself has strong regulations, he adds, ※but the biggest projects, the metros, hospitals or malls, are usually in suburbs outside the city, in Gurgaon or Noida, where those rules don＊t apply§.Even when clear orders are issued, they are routinely flouted. Brick production has been banned in Delhi for environmental reasons, but flourishes in nearby towns such as Dadri, in Uttar Pradesh state. At RR Brickfields, one of the 18 kilns that dot the dry fields around the town, workers including children were collecting finished bricks from a furnace cut deep into the earth. Thick smoke billows from a chimney stack for almost the entire six months each year that the kiln operates. Studies have suggested India＊s brick industry  of India＊s emissions of black carbon, a major contributor to climate change. Since early 2016, brick kiln owners have been required to gain environmental clearance before firing their ovens. ※But in some areas, people bribe officials. Sometimes they produce bricks secretly,§ said the owner of the kiln. He said he was still in the process of applying for a clearance and, despite the apparent signs of industry, insisted his kiln was not one of those operating.Then there is the largest year-round contributor to the city＊s air crisis: the dust thrown up by the more than 9 million cars that grind along Delhi＊s  road network. Dust has always been factor of Delhi life, but the particles released by traffic are particularly toxic, Mukherjee says. ※It mixes up with the vehicular emissions, the industrial pollution,§ he says. Harmful pollutants bind to the dust and settle in the air, when they might otherwise be dispersed by winds.Building more pavements would make ※a big difference§, he says. So would planting vegetation along dividers and road shoulders. ※Those bushes would get covered in dust, but it would prevent the dust from blowing further down the road,§ Mukherjee adds.A significant proportion of Delhi＊s pollution blows in from across the region, including from crop burning in Punjab and Haryana. There is growing awareness that Delhi＊s air problem is really a regional one. Modelling produced for the Guardian by Greenpeace shows that air pollution increases the risk of heart disease for Delhi residents, and the risk of lung cancer by 62% But the air in Amritsar, the Punjab capital, poses its residents a similar risk. The rates in Allahabad, in Uttar Pradesh, are even higher.But lasting change will also involve tackling Delhi＊s local pollution sources, Mukherjee says. ※We know the solutions. We＊ve known them for 30 years,§ he says. ※Implementation is the bane in .§Lung specialists such as Chaudhari are beginning to recommend to some older patients and those with chronic conditions to leave the city. ※At one stage you have to think Delhi is not the place to live, you should look for a better option,§ he says.He says he aims to leave the city before the age of 50. ※I＊m serious,§ he says. ※Next time someone tries to trace me, I might be gone.§"																																																			
"US secretary of defense James Mattis has urged allies to ※bear with us§, noting it would be a ※crummy world§ if Americans retreated into isolationism.Mattis was responding to questions at  about US leadership and commitment to a rules-based international order, in the wake of Donald Trump＊s announcement that his administration will , putting the country in the company of only Nicaragua and Syria. ※As far as the rules-based order, you know, obviously we have a new president in Washington DC,§ Mattis said at the event organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ※We＊re all aware of that. And there is going to be fresh approaches taken.§ He defended Trump, pointing out that the president had just made his first foreign trip, ※straight into the heart of one of the most bewildering and difficult challenges§ in the Middle East. However, the defense secretary did acknowledge a historical ※reluctance§ among Americans to engage with the world.※The 20th century took us out of that,§ he said. ※What a crummy world if we all retreat inside our own borders. How many people deprived of good lives during the Depression? How many tens of millions of people killed in WWII?

A former senior official in the national security council, , said the White House debate did not seem to have been carried out in a very organised way, with no representations from the Pentagon and not much science. ※No one appeared to be in charge of running the debate,§ Schulman, now at the Centre for a New American Security, said on Twitter. ※That matters for a few reasons: no one was ensuring that all perspectives were included.

"he bluffs on Panorama Road offer a wide view of the northern half of Bakersfield, which is one of the few major population centres in California＊s Central Valley 每 perhaps the US＊ leading agricultural motherlode.It＊s a rare bird＊s eye vantage point of this low-slung farm city of roughly 375,000 people, nestled in a bowl created by the Sierra Nevada mountains to the east and part of the  Coast Ranges to the west. On a clear day, the state＊s dominant topographical features put the landscape, and one＊s place in it, in sobering perspective.But clear days don＊t happen all that often in Bakersfield. Emissions from agriculture, industry, rail freight and road traffic together create one of the country＊s worst concentrations of air pollution 每 a condition exacerbated by geographic and climatic conditions that trap dry, dirty air over this southern section of Central Valley like the lid over a pot. fields make up most of the view from the top of the bluffs, and the scent of petroleum is often detectable around the city. Dairies populated by hundreds of thousands of cows are scattered throughout the region, and their smell, too, is hard to miss. Massive warehouses and distribution centres on the outskirts of town bring in diesel trucks day and night from Interstate 5, the major north-south route that runs from Canada to Mexico (Los Angeles is about 100 miles to the south). Freight trains hauling oil rumble through the city, and its many refineries billow smoke into the air.Bakersfieldand surrounding Kern County are the unlucky nexus of this pollution. The American Lung Association＊s  found the city＊s air to be the worst in the United States for short-term and year-round particle pollution, and the second worst for ozone pollution. One of the main indicators of poor air quality is the level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. The  ranks nearby Visalia-Porterville worst in the US.  in one 24-hour period in late January was 40.5 micrograms per cubic metre; over the mountains in somewhat smoggy Los Angeles, that number .Of the wider metro area＊s 875,000 people, about 70,000 are said to have asthma, 40,000 cardiovascular disease, and 27,000 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A  found the health impacts of the region＊s air pollution cost the southern section of the Central Valley, known as the San Joaquin, an estimated $3bn (?2.4bn) 每 or about $1,000 per person per year in a region where about a . Though some improvements have been made in recent years through more stringent air quality standards, cleaner burning engines and efficient industrial machinery, the region continues to struggle with poor air quality and the health problems it brings. Now the election of Donald Trump to the presidency, and his appointment of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) head in Scott Pruitt who is actively , has many worried that the small but steady improvements to the area＊s air quality may all be undone.Gustavo Aguirre Jr is a prominent local activist who works on environmental justice issues in many of the small, underserved and impoverished farming communities that surround Bakersfield. He says progress has been slow in the San Joaquin Valley, a conservative part of the state that＊s heavily influenced by agricultural and oil industry interests, and the Trump administration could further limit that progress. ※The potential of us going backwards 50 or 60 years in air pollution control and mitigation is very scary,§ says Aguirre. The worst air in the United States may soon be getting worse.But the authority tasked with addressing the region＊s air quality issues, the San Joaquin Valley Air  Control District, does not seem too concerned, suggesting it has done just about all it can to alleviate the problem.※Over the last 25 years, air pollution in the San Joaquin Valley 每 from the stationary sources we regulate 每 has been reduced by over 80% with some of the toughest air regulations in place anywhere in the nation,§ says Seyed Sadredin, the air district＊s executive director.These improvements have come through working with farmers to reduce the burning of agricultural waste, funding trade-ins for older farm equipment, and imposing requirements for cleaner burning furnaces and fireplaces, among other measures. Now, Sadredin argues, it is up to the state of California＊s Air Resources Board to better regulate mobile pollution sources 每 the cars, diesel trucks and freight trains 每 that are under the state＊s purview.※The biggest pollution source right now that＊s holding us back is the nitrogen oxide emissions from the mobile sources that make up 85% of the pollution,§ he adds.Indeed, Sadredin has begun calling for revisions to the , a landmark federal law overseeing environmental standards in the US, as a way to reduce or even eliminate the estimated  that have been placed on the valley because of its failure to meet federal clean air standards.A November 2016 air district  directed to the presidential transition team makes the argument that the valley is unfairly punished by the existing provisions of the Clean Air Act, and calls for changes.※We should have a more receptive ear at the EPA, if you read the tea leaves in the coming administration, that would pay attention to the economic devastation that some of these sanctions could cause to poor regions like ours,§ Sadredin says.He＊d prefer to make these changes through new legislation, like the  passed by the House of Representatives last year but was stalled before the end of the legislative session. ※[But] given the political dynamics and the divisiveness in Washington, getting a clean piece of legislation like that may be difficult, so we may ultimately be in a position that I hope we don＊t have to be in, where we have to attach what we need to something that perhaps does more than people like to see by way of changes to the Clean Air Act,§ Sadredin warns.Environmentalists and activists in Kern County worry that such a heavy-handed approach will erode the Clean Air Act, reducing regulations on Bakersfield＊s highly polluting industries.※It takes away the need to meet the standard no matter what it costs, because [Sadredin] wants language in there that reduces responsibility if it＊s economically or technologically unfeasible,§ says Tom Frantz, a local almond farmer and outspoken environmental activist. ※And once you get language like that into the Clean Air Act, you can justify not doing almost anything for technological or economic reasons. You have this huge loophole.※The San Joaquin Valley air pollution control district has claimed repeatedly that they＊ve done all they should be expected to do,§ Frantz adds. ※They have every excuse in the world of why they＊ve done enough. So our real enemy in this, from my side of things, is our own air district 每 which refuses to recognise the health costs of our continuing pollution levels, and is unwilling to do whatever＊s necessary to get it cleaned up.§While the results of the 2016 elections haven＊t been welcomed by all in Bakersfield, last year was a good one for the area＊s air quality. For the first time in nearly 20 years, the valley avoided violation of state and federal regulations for the concentration of : particulate matter that＊s 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller (roughly a 20th of the width of a human hair). These particles are a key measure of air quality because they＊re too small to be stopped from lodging in the lungs, and contribute to a variety of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases.After six years of extreme drought, a series of storms last year is credited with moving enough of the valley＊s air to bring down the PM2.5 measurements. ※The valley we live in has stagnant high-pressure systems that will sit for up to a month, even six weeks,§ Frantz says. ※Any time a low-pressure system comes off the Pacific, it blows out our bad air. If that would happen once a week, we would not have much of an air quality problem.§What also helped, he says, is the drop in prices for both oil and milk, two market conditions that resulted in reduced output from the region＊s refineries and dairies, and thus fewer of their polluting emissions. ※When they pull back a little bit because of low prices, we get a little bit cleaner air,§ Frantz says.But, he notes, those dairies and refineries could soon be operating at greater capacity again 每 and while the region got lucky with rain last year, normal annual rainfall in Bakersfield is just . Without stronger environmental regulations, he warns, Bakersfield could be stuck with its worst-ranked air quality for a long time to come.Some aren＊t waiting for action at the federal level. In the front room of a  in the tiny farmworker community of Lamont, just south of Bakersfield, around 25 community activists from a handful of local organisations have gathered to coordinate their efforts around environmental justice issues in Kern County. Planners at the county are currently working on a new countywide general plan, and  requires them to take into consideration environmental justice issues. Aguirre says the groups have to be strategic about how and where they advance their agenda. ※We＊ve made some progress at statewide level with the governor of California 每 but locally our pollution control district is an ultraconservative, pro-industry air district that says yes to everything from industry and no to the community.§To push back, he＊s working with a nearby community called Arvin to install a set of air pollution monitors throughout this small city to track PM2.5, ozone and other harmful pollutants. Aguirre is hoping to collect data to show local officials that air pollution issues here are much worse than the state and air district monitors report.He says small communities, especially those most affected by the region＊s poor air quality and other environmental issues, have to become more involved in documenting the conditions that pose public health risks. If they don＊t, he argues, nobody else will.※We have to fight,§ Aguirre says. ※Tooth and nail.§Compared to years past, Bakersfield＊s air has improved significantly, according to Bob Smith, a local real estate developer and Bakersfield city council member. ※I think it＊s a success story in a lot of ways,§ he says.Smith argues that state and local regulations have played a large role in reducing air pollution in the city and the valley, as have industrial investments in cleaner technologies. Various state grants and incentive programmes have also helped reduce pollution, offering trade-ins or tune-ups for older vehicles and incentivising the adoption of cleaner burning farm equipment.Now Smith sees the potential for even more improvements. A bicycle advocate who rides through downtown Bakersfield on a new , Smith has been trying to make the case that alternative forms of transportation can help reduce the city＊s air pollution. He helped establish the  in 2013, and also pushed the city to adopt a resolution in support of a  policy that refocuses road planning to accommodate pedestrians, cyclists and other forms of transportation in addition to cars.Walking down 18th street, a mostly sleepy commercial corridor in downtown Bakersfield, Smith points out a cafe he＊s helping to develop, and a 44-unit market-rate apartment project he＊s building a block away. They are two bets on the future of downtown, but also on the future of a more cosmopolitan style of city 每 not a traditional farm town renowned for its trucks and cowboy hats.But while Smith is optimistic about a greener future for the city, he also notes that its population  by more than 100,000 people from 2000 to 2010 每 one of the fastest rates of growth in the country. As more people move to the region, addressing pollution from vehicles and homes becomes even more important. Getting more people on bikes, or at least out of cars, will surely only help."																																																			
"Swift, smart and typically self-assured,  to Donald Trump＊s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords confirmed a near-faultless debut on the international stage for France＊s new president, analysts said. ※Make our planet great again,§ Macron, a diplomatic novice not yet 40, exhorted the world, recycling Trump＊s own slogan in an unprecedented address partly in English from the Elys谷e Palace soon after the US president had informed the world he was withdrawing from the global agreement on Thursday.

Macron is determined to ※rehabilitate the role of the president§, Gomart said, after what many saw as the vulgarity of Nicolas Sarkozy and the exaggerated normality of Fran?ois Hollande.※So what we see is a convergence between this young president who is the incarnation of a form of modernity, and these symbols that resonate with the French, these references to France＊s history,§ Gomart said. ※Don＊t forget parliamentary elections are not far away.§French and international media had a field day with the , in which the 39-year-old French leader squeezed his much older US counterpart＊s hand so hard that Trump＊s knuckles whitened and he was eventually forced to relinquish his grip.Macron later admitted the move had ※not been innocent§ and was ※a moment of truth§, describing Trump, Putin and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo?an, as men who see relationships ※in terms of a balance of power§ and to whom it was vital ※not to grant even small concessions§.Much was also made of his public admonishment of Putin on Monday. With the Russian president at his side in the gilded splendour of the Palace of Versailles, Macron warned France would show ※no weakness§ if chemical weapons were used in Syria, would be ※constantly vigilant§ on , and expected the  on Ukraine to be implemented.He also said firmly that Russia Today and Sputnik, two Kremlin-funded news outlets, had behaved ※like agents of influence and propaganda§ that had repeatedly ※spread serious untruths§ about him during his election campaign.Polls suggest the approach is proving effective with French voters. Macron＊s new political movement, La R谷publique En Marche, is on target for a 30% share of the national vote in next month＊s elections 每 a 10-point advance since his arrival in the Elys谷e last month.An Ipsos poll this week suggested the cross-party movement could win between 395 and 425 seats in the lower house of parliament, comfortably above the 289 it would need to secure an absolute majority in 577-seat national assembly.But there were suggestions on Friday that Macron＊s style may have backfired in one respect: the  that alongside intense EU pressure on Trump over the climate accord, agreed in the French capital in 2015, the younger leader＊s tough stance could just have confirmed Trump in his intentions.Macron＊s words ※irritated and bewildered§ the US president, the paper quoted unnamed White House aides as saying, and may have helped inspire his comment on Thursday that he ※was elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh 每 not Paris§.

"Global steel giant ArcelorMittal is failing to meet minimum environmental standards at its massive plant in central Bosnia, a Guardian Cities investigation has learned.The vast Zenica steelworks is operating without valid permits and a number of pledged improvements to reduce emissions from the factory have not been made [see footnote].When Lakshmi Mittal bought the Zenica plant in 2004, the Indian billionaire promised to make ※all appropriate investment in the protection of the environment§. But a decade on, much of this work has not been completed. Bosnia suffers from some of the world＊s highest levels of air pollution, with Zenica among the worst affected.Most winter days, the sky over ?ahiza ?ehi?＊s house is filled with plumes of acrid black smoke. ?ehi?, who is now retired, lives in the shadow of the steelworks, where she worked all her life.As she speaks, a huge cloud of thick dust drifts overhead. , the world＊s largest steelmaker and owner of this ?eljezara plant, has thus far failed to deliver on promises to reduce pollution from the steelworks＊ vertiginous chimneys and smokestacks. ※Sometimes there is so much dust you cannot believe it,§ ?ehi? says as she shuffles around her garden, which backs directly on to the factory perimeter fence. Regimented rows of plums, peaches, pears and strawberries are covered in a thin film of grey ash. ※In addition there is some kind of glittery dust,§ she says. ※Sometimes I even find it inside my house. I bring it in on my shoes.§Smail Sivi? lives a few doors down. On sunny days, Sivi? and his wife used to drink coffee in their backyard. ※Now if you are outside for 10 minutes, everything changes and turns into black,§ he says. ※Like somebody has sprinkled black pepper. It is killing us.§Zenica is a city of around 100,000 dominated by steel. The local football team is named  每 ※steelmaking§. The prevailing wind often carries carries fat reels of smoke and dust from the towering blast furnaces and needle-thin chimneys that puncture the skyline. On a bad day, even drawing a breath .Downtown, electronic displays erected atop the slate-grey communist-era apartment blocks measure the amount of sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the air [see footnote]. In 2015, levels of this toxic gas 每 which comes from burning coal 每 exceeded EU safe limits 166 times. Locals have  ArcelorMittal＊s failure to introduce environmental improvements that were pledged when the steel giant bought the plant over a decade ago.The Zenica steelworks first opened at the tail-end of the 19th century, when Bosnia-Herzegovina was a restive part of Austro-Hungarian empire. Under , production boomed. Workers were recruited from all over the former Yugoslavia and even further afield.Production ground to a halt during the , which began 25 years ago this April. In 2004, , one of the world＊s richest men,  during the postwar privatisation drive. The deal was widely welcomed in Zenica 每 in a city devastated by war and hardship, many saw this as a chance for work, a chance to return to normality.But prosperity has not returned to Zenica. The steelworks employed around 22,000 people in 1991, but barely a 10th of that figure work in ?eljezara today. Many complain that their jobs are insecure and have come at huge cost to the local environment.In the 2004 privatisation agreement Mittal Steel, now ArcelorMittal, committed to make ※all appropriate investment in the protection of the environment§. In documents submitted to the Bosnian Federal Ministry in 2008, seen by the Guardian, the steel giant promised to undertake a series of expensive measures to reduce emissions. This work was to be completed by the end of 2011.More than five years after that deadline, many of these improvements have not been finished or, in some cases, even started. The huge basic oxygen furnace (BOF) still operates without secondary dedusting, which is in contravention of Bosnia＊s Environmental Protection Act. There has been no desulphurisation of the coke oven. The plant has been operating without some of the required environmental permits since December 2014; others lapsed in November 2015.ArcelorMittal states that permits are expected to be in place ※very soon§, and that in the meantime it is entitled to continue operations. It also says the rise in SO2 emissions since the plant restarted can be attributed to the town＊s ageing central heating system, and to locals burning coal to heat their homes.But while estimates suggest Zenica households use around 50,000 tonnes of coal each year, the steelworks consumed about 16 times that 每 815,098 tonnes 每 in 2014 alone, according to statistics released by Bosnia＊s federal ministry for environment and tourism [ArcelorMittal have asked us to make clear that one third of the coal consumed by ArcelorMittal Zenica is used for the voluntary supply of heating to the city. Further, that he 545,888 tonnes of coal consumed in the coke plant contains 0.9% sulphur, and the 269,210 tonnes of coal consumed in the power plant for the voluntary supply of heating to the town contains 3.5% sulphur 每 this coal, with a higher sulphur content, is supplied locally as part of an agreement with local authorities.].Air pollution is a major problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The country has the world＊s . Rates of lung diseases are among the highest in the world. Bosnia loses a staggering  each year due to the air pollution. In Tetevo, a ribbon of ageing houses and grassy escarpments abutting the Zenica steelworks, residents have been warned not to eat locally grown broadleaf vegetables or .Many locals believe the air pollution causes disease. Both ?ahiza ?ehi? and her husband, Asim, have had cancer. Many of her neighbours have had similar health problems. ※There are people with pulmonary cancer, breast cancer; many have digestive tract cancer,§ ?ehi? says. ※Almost every house has lost at least one person due to cancer. It wasn＊t like this before.§Samir Lemes joined the environmental group  in 2009. The previous year, his father had died and he was worried about the effect the environment was having on his two children. ※Every winter we are coughing, contracting the flu and similar health problems, which I blame the pollution for,§ says Lemes, who is now Eko Forum＊s president.In 2015, Eko Forum filed criminal complaints against ArcelorMittal and the federal authorities, citing the continuous high level of air pollution 每 the first formal accusation of environmental crimes in Bosnia. In January 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Bosnia＊s federal ministry of environment, this time by the authorities of the city of Zenica itself. Both cases are ongoing.A spokesperson for ArcelorMittal said: ※If any case does proceed, we will vigorously defend our record, based on strong, factual evidence.§Lemes wants ArcelorMittal to fulfill the promises made when the multinational took over the steelworks. He is not alone; in Zenica＊s centre, graffiti on the walls carries stark messages: ※We want filters,§ read one.Lakshmi Mittal, who also owns an address in Kensington and a large stake in Queen＊s Park Rangers football club, is one of the biggest investors in postwar Bosnia. ArcelorMittal, the company of which he is both chairman and chief executive, is the . Professor Smail Durmi?evi? from the Institute for Public Health has spent his career looking at the impact of air pollution in Zenica, and believes the level of SO2 is dangerous. But due to a lack of resources 每 and, he believes, political will 每 no detailed studies have been conducted on the connections between the air in Zenica and diseases such as cancer. ※Society doesn＊t encourage us to do this job. I have been aware of this situation but nobody seems to care,§ he says.Leme? claims ArcelorMittal has been able to take advantage both of Bosnia＊s complicated state structure (there is no single office to deal with the environment) and of fears that the company could close the steelworks.※We have one big corporation that is much more powerful than the state,§ Leme? says. ※When the state tries to impose any kind of pressure over them, they just say that they will leave and over 2,000 people will be without a job. The problem is that the state believes these threats.§A few hundred yards from the edge of the steelworks, Samir Kubat＊s young family live in a squat, cramped house. Kubat, a veteran of the Bosnian war, is stocky and well-built with strong, dark features. His youngest son is noticeably paler, with an incessant, hacking cough.※During the winter, every week I have to take him to see the doctor,§ says Kubat, who became involved with Eko Forum after his best friend died of lung cancer. As we speak, the roof of a large, box-shaped furnace in the middle-distance opens, and a volcano of thick, red-orange smoke billows up into the sky.A spokesperson for ArcelorMittal said the company is ※extremely proud of our record of investment in ecological improvements§. The company has invested 45m in environmental improvements in Zenica since taking over the plant, and told the Guardian the filtration system on the basic oxygen furnace is due to be in place by the end of 2018: ※The company continues to take every possible technical step to reduce coal consumption in our power plant boilers.§On concerns about the link between air pollution and ill-health, the company said: ※Unfortunately we are witnessing increases in all forms of cancer all over the world ＃ We are working hard to reduce our emissions, but ArcelorMittal alone cannot solve the increase in cancer.§ Regarding the allegation that it responds to state pressure by threatening to move jobs out of Zenica, the company said it was ※completely groundless§, and went on: ※From the beginning, we have been open and transparent about the significant environmental challenges we are addressing in Zenica. They are rooted in the history of the plant, which was built at a time when no attention was paid to ecological factors. The factory was then largely disused for almost 17 years following the war in the 1990s, creating further unique technical challenges. The antiquated city heating system, and the area＊s specific geographical and meteorological environment are also significant factors. ※We have always been honest in explaining that these problems will take considerable time to resolve. We are determined to do so, but improvements can only be achieved through co-operation from all parties.§It also pointed to its investments and 45m spent on environmental improvements, as well as ※a new contract for almost 20m recently signed to secure the future of the blast furnace for the next 15 years. Discussions are in progress for a major joint venture with the local authorities to finally resolve the city＊s heating problems. These are hardly the actions of a company ＊threatening to close down＊. We believe our actions speak for themselves in demonstrating our strong commitment to building a long-term, sustainable future for steelmaking in Zenica.§It added that the steelworks ※will be fully aligned with EU standards§ before Bosnia joins the European Union. Right now, the prospect of the EU admitting this fractured Balkan state seems remote.Meanwhile, many young people are leaving Zenica in search of work 每 and clean air. Among them is Kanita Bili?, a talented teenage athlete who moved to Germany last spring. ※I want to run for a living, and in Zenica it is not possible,§ she says. ※I cannot even breathe when I am running. Sometimes it is so polluted [there] that I feel pain in my chest.§Two months after she left, Bili? won her first competition gold for the acclaimed VFB Stuttgart athletics team. Bili? would like to train in Zenica again 每 but only when she can breathe."																																																			
"he life of a  mule deer is a tough one. In order to survive, thousands of the deer undertake an arduous 150-mile migration twice a year to find food. Manmade and natural hazards abound on this two-month trek.※It＊s not just about getting from point A to B, they have to forage all along the way,§ said Matt Kauffman, a University of Wyoming zoologist. ※These animals are slowly starving to death all winter. If winter is long enough or they are held up, the animals will die.§Migrating animals can wander on to highways and be flattened by trucks, or tumble through frozen lakes. Fences, mining operations and other obstacles also provide a challenge. But for the mule deer, there is no choice 每 they must follow what Kauffman calls the ※green wave§ of young, lush vegetation from the mountainous greater Yellowstone area to the brush of Wyoming＊s interior as the seasons change. They either move or starve. This  is the longest in the contiguous US and, despite having occurred for thousands of years, was only fully discovered by researchers in 2011. Its epic length is rivaled only by the ※path of the pronghorn§, a journey that takes America＊s fastest land mammal on a biannual trudge to and from Grand Teton national park in search of water.These migration routes take the animals through a patchwork of public and private land. The importance of publicly owned national parks was recognized long ago, but these crucial wildlife corridors linking protected areas are only starting to be understood and valued.But the nascent movement to safeguard wildlife corridors 每 vital for animals as diverse as wolves, bears, elk, tortoises and ground-dwelling birds 每 is now at risk. In recent years, congressional Republicans have pushed for federal land in the western states to be handed over for development. With Donald Trump now in the White House, these ambitions could come to fruition.A bill put forward by Jason Chaffetz, a Utah congressman, to sell off 3.3m acres of federal land  following uproar from conservationists and the outdoor recreation industry. But with Trump voicing support for greater oil and gas drilling on public land, wildlife corridors risk being disrupted or even severed. ※When a migrating mule deer hits an energy development area, they tend to speed up or try to detour around them,§ said Kauffman. ※This affects their access to food and makes migrations more difficult. As these corridors become less viable, they can be lost.※Selling off public land would risk that. We are are at the infancy of understanding wildlife corridors, but we are starting to make progress. It looks like that could all be wound back.§The deer and pronghorn that roamed the western states before white settlers arrived may no longer be in the tens of millions, but these species are currently at little risk of extinction. Still, their abundance could be severely hit if their corridors are lost, which raises concerns for recreational hunters, as well as ecologists who study the network of life in the west.Wolves and bears require reliable access to prey species. Unlike hoofed animals that have well-worn, repeated pathways, wolves and bears disperse to adjoining lands depending on the dynamics of their groups. Young male wolves, for example, tend to leave groups in order to establish new ones elsewhere. The reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone in 1995 has created a ripple effect 每 wolves have moved through a network of protected areas as far as Washington state.While most landowners are happy to allow deer or elk pass through their land, wolves or bears aren＊t quite as welcome given their tendency to devour livestock. The population of grizzly bears in the Yellowstone region has rebounded sixfold since it was placed under federal protection in 1975. Surrounding states, pressured by landowners concerned about bears exiting the national park, have successfully persuaded the federal Fish and  Service that the species should be delisted to allow them to be hunted.Conservationists are increasingly turning their attention to private landowners to help promote and secure wildlife corridors. In a single 20-mile search for food, a species may cross land overseen by the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and privately owned ranches.※It＊s a real mix,§ said Mark Elsbree, vice-president of the , which works to buy private land to avoid bottlenecks in migration routes. ※Private landowners are generally interested in wildlife habitat but as the properties are sold, the generations turn over, we risk losing that connectivity. New migration routes keep coming up on our radar and we need to act upon that.§In 2015, the Conservation Fund purchased a 364-acre property at a notorious bottleneck for the mule deer＊s Red Desert-to-Hoback route, near the city of Pinedale, Wyoming. The fund then switched its attention to the greater sage grouse, known for its elaborate mating rituals and for being in the middle of a struggle between its protection and land development.The sage grouse has been known to move up to 100 miles at a time, between its sage brush winter habitat to open meadows used to rear young. The species has lost almost half of its habitat since European settlers arrived, with 45% of its remaining domain on state and private lands.In February, the Conservation Fund scooped up 100,000 acres of sage grouse habitat in Idaho, Wyoming and Colorado, but risks remain. Senate Republicans are attempting to end federal involvement in sage grouse protection, which could allow the states to open up more habitat for drilling.※The pinch points for migration typically exist on private land,§ said Elsbree. ※But if federal lands were to change hands, then the very platform upon which species survive will be compromised.§Climate change provides another threat to wildlife corridors.  showed the stark implications for nearly 3,000 species in North and South America. Many are already retreating northward to cope with warming temperatures, although a pathway isn＊t always evident. According to a study , only 41% of US land area is currently connected enough to allow species to move to more bearable climes. Some will have nowhere to go, either hemmed in by human constructions or simply a lack of livable space. ※The bottom line is that species will need to move or adapt, or die,§ said Brad McRae, a senior landscape ecologist at the Nature Conservancy. ※More and more people are understanding that wildlife needs protection outside distinct national parks, especially with climate change,§ said Elsbree. ※It＊s important that we look at the whole system. If lands are sold and developed, we could lose some migration routes. We need to avoid that happening.§"																																																			
																																																			
"Air quality in the Indian holy city of Varanasi is ※the most toxic in the country§ according to research that reveals the extent of the pollution crisis across northern .There has been a growing awareness of the dangers of the smog that envelopes Delhi in the winter months, but a report released on Monday by three environmental groups highlights the extent of the problem across the north Indian plains, where levels of harmful airborne particles are routinely higher than in the capital.According to 2015 data from the Central  Control Board (CPCB), Varanasi and Allahabad, both located in India＊s largest and most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, did not record a single day of ※good§ air quality in the more than 220 days that measurements were taken.※Good§ air indicates an Air Quality Index score below 50. Anything above 100 每 ※moderate§ 每 is considered to be dangerous for children, the elderly and people with respiratory conditions.The report＊s lead author, Aishwarya Madineni, said the levels recorded in Varanasi appeared to regularly breach 150, when the air is classified as ※unhealthy§ and begins to affect the general population.The researchers found that levels of airborne pollution in Varanasi finer than 2.5 micro-metres 每 the most harmful variety because they can reach deep into the lungs and breach the blood-brain barrier 每 were routinely double the safe limit in October and November 2015.Levels of coarser particles finer than 10 micro-metres were triple the safe limit in 2016 and had increased by more than one-third since 2010, the research showed.A 2016 World Health Organisation study found that half of the world＊s 20 most polluted cities were in India, starting with Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh.Allahabad and Delhi were also listed as suffering from toxic levels of fine pollution in the WHO report but Varanasi was not measured.The spiritual capital, which draws hundreds of thousands of Hindu pilgrims to the banks of the Ganges river each year, had just one monitoring station capable of measuring the finest pollution particles, and even that station had ※huge gaps in the data§, Madineni said.The pollution＊s cause in Varanasi is much the same as in Delhi: a mix of dust kicked up by traffic and construction sites, vehicular and industrial emissions, smoke from private diesel generators and open fires lit by poorer residents.Uttar Pradesh is also home to at least 18 coal-fired power stations, the emissions from which can travel hundreds of kilometres and diminish air quality across the region. Among six cities in Uttar Pradesh highlighted in the report, only two 每 Kanpur and Agra 每 had more than 12 ※good§ air quality days each year. Child specialists cited in the report said there had been an eight-fold rise in respiratory illnesses in Varanasi and the degrading air quality seen as the main cause.Rates of asthma and patients reporting breathlessness in the city had also increased by up to 25%, according to RN Vajpayee, a pulmonologist and chest physician cited in the study.Air quality in Delhi  in the past three months, leading to emergency shutdowns of power stations, construction sites and schools. A 2015 study has shown that about half the capital＊s 4.4 million schoolchildren have had their lung capacity  because of the pollution."

Police rarely allow protests in , but small-scale demonstrations are usually dispersed quickly and without mass detentions. The response in Chengdu was severe given the size, although exact numbers for the protest are unknown.Some reported being stopped and questioned by police simply for wearing pollution masks in the same neighbourhood as the demonstration, according to social media posts, with at least a dozen being detained.

"Action to combat the UK＊s air pollution crisis has been delayed again after the government rejected a proposal to deliver an effective action plan within eight months.Environmental lawyers ClientEarth inflicted a  last week 每 its second in 18 months 每 when the high court ruled that ministers＊ plans to tackle illegal levels of air pollution in many UK cities and towns were unlawfully poor.The court gave the parties seven days to agree on the next steps, but the government rejected the proposal from ClientEarth. The case will now return to court at a future date when the judge will determine what happens next.Air pollution causes over 40,000 early deaths and at least ?27.5bn in costs every year in the UK, according to the government＊s own estimates, and was called a ※§ by MPs in April. An earlier government plan to tackle air pollution was declared illegal in April 2015 and ministers were ordered then to produce a new strategy, which it did in December. But that new plan was also found to be illegal last week.※We are disappointed that we have been unable so far to agree on the timetable for the new plan, or on the future role for the court in overseeing compliance with the order,§ said ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews. ※We have made our written submissions and await the court＊s decision.§ Aaron Kiely, at Friends of the Earth, said: ※How many times must the government fail? And how many deadlines do they need? There is a simple and deadly fact underscoring this case 每 40,000 people are dying early from the harmful effects of our illegally dirty air. If this isn＊t enough to get the government to do whatever it takes, including really drastic measures to reduce traffic, what is?§After the most recent court defeat, prime minister Theresa May said: ※There is more to do and we will do it.§ A spokeswoman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said on Wednesday: ※Our plans have always followed the best available evidence. We have always been clear that we are ready to update them if necessary and we will set out further measures next year. We cannot comment on ongoing legal proceedings.§In last week＊s judgment against the government, Mr Justice Garnham said it was ※remarkable§ that ministers knew they were using over-optimistic pollution modelling, based on flawed lab tests of diesel vehicles rather than , but proceeded anyway.The existing government plan is for clean air zones 每 in which polluting diesel vehicles are charged to enter city centres 每 in just six UK cities.

"A group of leading economists warned on Monday that the world risks catastrophic global warming in just 13 years unless countries ramp up taxes on carbon emissions to as much as $100 (?77) per metric tonne.Experts including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and former World Bank chief economist  said governments needed to move quickly to tackle polluting industries with a tax on carbon dioxide at $40-$80 per tonne by 2020.A tax of $100 a tonne would be needed by 2030 as one of a series of measures to prevent a rise in global temperatures of 2C.In a report by the , which is backed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, they suggest poor countries could aim for a lower tax since their economies are more vulnerable.The aim of a tax on carbon would be essential to meet the targets , they said.The call for action will sting European leaders, who have presided over a carbon trading scheme since 2005 that currently charges major polluters just 6 (?5.20) for every tonne of carbon they release into the atmosphere.The European scheme, which issues firms with carbon credits that can be traded on a central exchange, has come under fire for allowing heavy energy users to avoid investments in new technology to cut their emissions. and allowing the price to fall to a level that makes it cheaper for companies to pollute than change their behaviour.Stiglitz and Stern said prices should rise to $50-$100 by 2030 to give businesses and governments an incentive to lower emissions even when fossil fuels are cheap.The Trump administration  in the United States, saying it would cost jobs. Washington＊s refusal to adopt a tax has deterred Brussels from moving to a more substantial charge on emissions, which would have the effect of increasing energy costs, at least in the short term, and imposing higher costs on European manufacturers.The European Union＊s  (ETS) is the world＊s biggest scheme for trading greenhouse gas emissions allowances. It covers 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 30 countries, whose carbon emissions make up almost 50% of Europe＊s total."																																																			
"Seabirds are enticed into eating plastic debris because it smells like their food, according to scientists. found that drifting plastic waste accumulates algae and gives off a smell very similar to the krill that many marine birds feed on. The findings could explain why certain birds - including albatrosses and shearwaters - which rely on their sense of smell for hunting, are .Matthew Savoca, the study＊s lead author at the University of California Davis, said: ※Animals usually have a reason for the decisions they make. If we want to truly understand why animals are eating plastic in the ocean, we have to think about how animals find food.§The rate of plastic pollution is steadily increasing worldwide, with  estimating that about eight million metric tons of plastic - enough to cover every foot of coastline in the world - is enters the oceans annually.It is known that birds and other marine creatures, including turtles and fish, ingest plastic. This can lead to damage to internal organs, gut blockages or build-ups of chemicals from the plastics in the animals＊ tissues. Previous studies have shown that some birds feed their young bits of waste - presumably mistaking it for food.To investigate what attracts birds to debris, the scientists put beads made from the three most common types of plastic - high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene - into the ocean at Monterey Bay and Bodega Bay, off the California coast.The beads were sewn into mesh bags and tied to buoys to avoid any of them being eaten by wildlife.Three weeks later, the beads were collected and the smell they gave off was analysed at the UC Davis Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science, where scientists normal focus on the chemistry behind the flavour and fragrance of wines.The plastic was found to give off a sulfur compound, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), linked to the algae which coated the floating plastic. The same team had previously shown that DMS is the chemical cue that triggers certain seabirds to forage for krill - or as the scientists put it ※the birds＊ version of a dinner bell§. It is this cue that is being hijacked by the plastics. In a second piece of analysis, using data from 55 studies and 13,315 birds, the scientists showed that seabirds that track the scent of DMS to find prey - a group known as tube-nosed seabirds and which includes albatrosses, petrels, and shearwaters - are nearly six times more likely to eat plastic than other birds.  could be better protected in future, the scientists argue, by creating plastics that do not accumulate algae as readily in the sea.Berry Mulligan,nternational marine programme officer at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: ※While research such as this is raising the alarm about plastics in our oceans, it is hard to realistically estimate the magnitude of the problem for seabirds at a global level. Seabirds are one of most threatened groups of birds in the world, but untangling the effects of multiple threats to seabirds is a challenge, one which underlines the importance of ongoing research such as this which helps determine vulnerability of different species.§The findings are published in the journal Science Advances."																																																			
"A global chemical company has been fined for poor operational practices that killed one of its employees and seriously hurt another when they were overcome by a toxic vapour cloud.Cristal Pigment UK Ltd was sentenced at Hull Crown Court on 8 November for two incidents that occurred within less than two years at Europe＊s largest titanium dioxide plant at Stallingborough in north-east Lincolnshire.The company, which was formerly known as Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, is part of the Cristal Group, a leading international producer of titanium chemicals. Titanium dioxide is widely used as a cheap white pigment but the European Chemicals Agency recently consulted on plans to declare it a .The court heard that, in the early hours of 5 March 2010, there was a build-up of titanium tetrachloride 每 an intermediate in the process to produce titanium oxide - within a vessel. The chemical came into contact with water creating a violent reaction, which ruptured the vessel. The liquid came into contact with the air creating a large toxic vapour cloud.One worker was showered with the corrosive liquid and . His colleague was covered by the vapour cloud, surviving his injuries but with irreversible lung damage.The vapour cloud poured out from the site, blew out across the river Humber and closed down shipping lanes for several hours, until the incident was brought under control by the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service.An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found the company had deviated from normal operating procedures, which led to the dangerous build-up of the chemical. Parts of the plant and its procedures were poorly designed and the company had not established robust safety management procedures and systems of work to assess and control risk and to ensure these were actually followed.The following year, on 27 July 2011, there was another uncontrolled release of a toxic vapour during the cleaning of a redundant vessel.The vessel, which is normally connected to the chemical production plant, was being replaced. The old vessel was removed and stored, for around three-years, with several tonnes of residual titanium tetrachloride.The HSE＊s investigation found that Cristal had poorly managed the design and installation of fabricated plates to seal the vessel before carrying out the cleaning process. The plates were incompatible, incorrectly designed and used inappropriate sealants that could not contain the gas created during the procedure, releasing a toxic vapour cloud.Cristal Pigment UK pleaded guilty to breaching sections 2(1) and 3(1) of the  for the 2010 incident and also regulation 4 of the  for the 2011 incident.It was fined ?2.4m for the first case and ?600,000 for the second, with ?37,868 costs.After the hearing, HSE inspector Brian Fotheringham noted that, if the wind had been blowing in the opposite direction the 2010 incident ※could also have caused a local disaster§.※However, the company still did not learn lessons from the 2010 incident and had another significant release of the same toxic gas just over a year later,§ he said. ※This case must act as a reminder to the industry that there can be no room for complacency when dealing with such dangerous chemicals.§When asked why the prosecution had taken so long to conclude, the HSE noted that the incident very complicated and required input from a large number of specialist disciplines. The judge himself had said that ※no criticism can, or should, be made for the delay. The investigation has been a mammoth task for the HSE.§Rob Sarracini, Cristal＊s Stallingborough site director, said the company was ※extremely sorry for the failings that took place§ which had a significant impact on many of the plant＊s employees.※Our plant in Stallingborough is a highly complex and specialized manufacturing process. Immediately following the incident, we worked closely with the HSE, cooperating fully. Following both the HSE＊s and our own investigations, it was found that there were deficiencies and we accept responsibility for these failings. We have taken the learnings and made significant improvements in many areas of our site.§"																																																			
"n Sunday, the capital city of one of the world＊s fastest growing economies was effectively shut down in an emergency act. The reason was not terrorism, but air pollution. The  was judged so great that traffic was ratioined, coal-fired power stations closed and diesel generators suspended. This was a?brave and sane decision in the world＊s largest democracy.Right now Delhi is the world＊s most polluted city. But air quality is at crisis levels in cities around the world. More than , and 2 billion in areas where outdoor pollution exceeds health guidelines. Half of Delhi＊s schoolchildren have permanently impaired lung capacity, thanks to the air they breathe.India＊s capital city is telling people to stay away or work from home, but offering no compensation to those who cannot, or whose livelihood suffers. This can only be a short-term solution; it hurts those who can least bear it. Although the prime minister Theresa May will have been sheltered from the worst of the choking smog , arriving in Delhi should have been a powerful warning about the effects of privileging growth over environmental concerns. Citizens of rich countries are sometimes too relaxed about such things when air pollution afflicts the richest cities as well as the poorest. That?London has not yet been closed down in?similar fashion to Delhi is only through lack?of?courage on the part of the government.Air quality in London has hit levels worse than those in Delhi and Beijing. Earlier this year, annual air pollution limits were breached in just a week.  and there must be immediate action, even if that means drastic measures to curtail traffic.The causes of air pollution differ around the world, from coal-fired power plants to agricultural burning. One constant is traffic. Older cars and diesel engines produce particulates that clog up the lungs and may enter brain tissue, and nitrogen oxides that affect breathing. Car manufacturers were forced to admit last year that they had flouted tests on their diesel emissions. But the bigger question is why in a shortsighted attempt to reduce greenhouse gases by a tiny amount (diesel cars do more miles to the gallon) the risks were ignored, and customers persuaded that diesel cars were actually greener.Now that the consequences for air quality are clear, it is time to rebalance taxation and regulation in favour of petrol, which is cleaner though producing more carbon, and urgently incentivise electric cars. In London , the new mayor, to his credit has taken a strong line on air pollution, in contrast to Boris Johnson＊s tactics which amounted to unconvincing denial and attempts to silence scientists. Mr Khan should move faster still on banning the most polluting vehicles 每 he would find public support in inner London.Air pollution shames us all. From Beijing to Los Angeles,  to Manila, the air we breathe in cities has deteriorated so much that it is no longer safe for children. Adults who grew up breathing cleaner air are more resilient in the face of polution. But when a child＊s lungs are damaged, they are damaged for life. The next generation already carries the burden of our inaction. This is a problem we know how to solve. Cut down coal-fired power, cut out diesel in cities, encourage electric cars and public transport. India should follow the declaration of emergency with long-term action, not just this short-term fix. Richer cities, London foremost among them, should be ashamed that they, with all their resources, have failed their children for so long. The high court judges were right. The?government can and must act?now."																																																			
"It sometimes feels as if we are living in the elephant＊s darkest hour. China may be closing down its domestic ivory trade and the EU getting to grips with smuggling, yet the poachers continue their bloody business. Meanwhile, forests are being destroyed, herds＊ migration routes are being blocked, and humans and elephants are  for land, food and water.So this is a good time to point out that humans have plenty of selfish reasons to make space for elephants. It＊s not a question of giving them a free lunch: they can pay their own way.Researchers at the universities of Utah and Chicago  that elephants have evolved a superior DNA repair mechanism to get rid of cells that have cancer-causing mutations. This could help scientists develop novel drugs to treat cancer or even prevent it from developing. An elephant＊s hearing range is closer to a human＊s than any animal used to model hearing in medicine 每 particularly the mouse, whose peak hearing sensitivity is at the upper range of ours. We lose our high-frequency hearing over time, which means that the mouse ear is even less useful in the study of ageing and hearing loss. Understanding the mechanics of how the elephant ear detects sounds in the range of 20Hz could inform new hearing-aid designs. Elephants have the ability to detect sounds that travel through the ground as seismic ※cues§, such as other elephant calls. They achieve this through vibration-sensitive cells in their feet and trunk. Humans have similar vibration-detecting cells (as do all mammals) in the hand, foot, lips and even the gut.  at Stanford University School of Medicine has shown the potential for elephant-inspired vibrational hearing aids.Not only do elephants have a similar lifespan to humans; they also experience cardiovascular problems and age-related diseases such as osteoarthritis.  may help us to understand how our own bodies change over time. Elephants are the only animals that have the ※extended knee§ posture that humans have, as well as a similar heel-to-toe pattern of walking.Humans, killer whales and pilot whales are the only species known to undergo menopause. Studying what may be delayed menopause in elephants could provide new insights into our own fertility and ageing.But perhaps you care about the environment more than human health? Here too, elephants are pulling their weight.You＊ve heard the slogan, ※Plant a tree, save the Earth§? You could also say, ※Save an elephant, save the Earth§. Elephants have been planting trees for thousands of years, depositing partially digested seeds and rich manure every time they produce dung. The seeds of many species must pass through the gut of an elephant in order to germinate. Without elephants, they would disappear.Believe it or not, an elephant＊s predilection for knocking down trees is healthy for old-growth forests. The open spaces that are created allow other plant species to grow and provide food that many other animals rely on, large mammals and insects included. The modern conservation problem for elephants is that they are often living in human-dominated landscapes where they are no longer free to migrate. In this situation, the forest isn＊t able to recover quickly enough from their depredations.Although it isn＊t known exactly how they can detect underground sources of water, whether through smell or through sensing the vibrations from artesian wells, in times of drought elephant dig wells and provide a life-saving source of water for themselves and other animals.On a more esoteric level, we should consider keeping elephants around because:The more we take the time to understand elephants, the more insight we gain into our own natures.  on the intelligence scale, as they exhibit self-recognition, use tools, have language (using not only verbal but visual and olfactory cues as well), show empathy and have long-term memories. On top of all that, they are extremely similar to us socially. Looking at an elephant can be like looking in the mirror. Not least when it comes to taking care of the elderly. An elephant＊s long life in the wild comes to an end when they lose their last set of six molars and are no longer able to eat. Sometimes a young bull will help an older bull by chewing branches and other food for the elder and then feeding him. It＊s a humbling reminder that we too need to take good care of our own seniors.Who wouldn＊t want to be able to share the cuteness of such a closely aligned species with the next generation?

"The federal government would consider any strategies to prevent further shark attacks off Australia＊s coast, ※In light of the recent shark attack the commonwealth would welcome any proposal to protect human life first and foremost,§ the federal environment minister, , told the West Australian.This could include culling or introducing new drumline technology.The new Labor state government said on Tuesday it would not deploy drumlines to try to catch the shark responsible, which is believed to be a great white.※We made it clear in opposition that we don＊t see the merit in automatically deploying drumlines because they don＊t actually make our beaches any safer,§ the fisheries minister, Dave Kelly, told reporters on Tuesday.Kelly said the new Labor government wanted to promote individual shark deterrents and hoped to announce a new policy in the next few weeks.Last year while in opposition, Labor proposed a $200,000 subsidy scheme for personal shark deterrent devices.Under the plan, 1,000 devices such as Shark Shield would be available with a $200 state government subsidy.Fatal shark attacks appear to have increased significantly in the state＊s waters. Of the 24 known deaths in WA in the past century, 14 have been since 2004, including two in the same week last June.Laeticia, 17, died from massive blood loss after she was attacked on Easter Monday by the shark while surfing with her father while on a family holiday in Esperance.Kelp Beds at Wylie Bay remains closed until further notice and fisheries staff will continue water patrols."																																																			
"The true impact of air pollution has been obscured by the failure to consider people＊s exposure as they move around during the day, according to a new study that has mapped the hotspots of New York＊s air pollution based on where people gather for work or recreation.The  cites air pollution as ※the world＊s single largest environment and human health threat§ but laments that the problem has not previously been ※considered spatially and temporally§, with most studies basing a person＊s pollution exposure on where they live.Using information obtained from cellphone towers, the researchers were able to build up a picture of millions of New Yorkers＊ movements over the course of 120 days. They used a formula that charts population density as well as pollution levels to look at how people＊s exposure to , an airborne particle linked to an array of health problems, varies according to where they typically congregate during the day.The researchers found that areas of midtown and lower Manhattan, which have some of the highest PM2.5 levels, saw large numbers of people exposed during the day, but less so at night. Conversely, areas of southern Brooklyn with high PM2.5 levels peaked in pollution exposure at night as people returned to their neighborhoods after work. Areas of Queens near LaGuardia airport remained elevated throughout the day.Concentrations of PM2.5 also vary throughout the day and affect the identification of hotspots, depending on factors including power generation and traffic.※Air pollution is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses but we have previously presumed that people exposed are at home all the time,§ said Dr Marguerite Nyhan, lead author and a researcher in environmental health at Harvard University, although all the research was conducted at MIT＊s Senseable City Lab.※We know that＊s not a true assessment of exposure as more people are exposed as they go from home to work and when they are socializing. We found that lots of people are being exposed in central Brooklyn and Queens and lower Manhattan, where people work and recreate. ※But that＊s not the way cities are typically regulated for air pollution 每 they just look at highly polluted areas rather than the amount of time people spend in them.§Disregarding population shifts throughout the day, PM2.5 air pollution in New York is greatest in midtown and downtown Manhattan, parts of the Bronx and areas of Queens and Brooklyn that meet the East River. These areas have PM2.5 levels that are around 14 micrograms per square meter 每 higher than the  as acceptable by the World Health Organisation (WHO).According to WHO, worldwide around  as a result of air pollution. The US accounts for around , with most linked to fumes from cars, trucks and other transportation, as well as emissions from power plants. Particles of PM2.5, which are around 30 times smaller than a human hair in width, can worsen asthma and heart disease and are linked to reduced lung function.A  found that annual average PM2.5 levels fell by 16% in the six years to 2014 but warned that air pollutants ※remain at levels that can be harmful to public health, particularly among seniors, children and those with pre-existing health conditions§.Asked whether the city considers peoples＊ exposure as they move around the metropolis, a spokesman for New York＊s mayor, Bill de Blasio, said: ※The city＊s monitoring study is designed to assess outdoor, street-level air pollutant levels across the city. ※So in a sense, the data can be used to assess exposures at residences, places of employment, or parks and other recreation areas. The study is not designed to assess any single exposure setting.§De Blasio has set a goal for  to have the cleanest air of any US city by 2030, pledging to cut PM2.5 levels by 50% in this timeframe by adding electric vehicles to the city fleet, phasing in clean sources of electricity and making buildings more energy efficient.Nyhan said her research, published in , could be used if New York wanted to go down the path of ※low emissions zones§ as . Motorists driving in most areas of Greater London have to pay a daily charge unless their vehicles meet European emissions standards.※If you identify areas of higher exposure, you can implement low emissions zones there for the maximum health benefit,§ said Nyhan, who plans to undertake a similar spatial study in Boston. ※In the last 100 years, air quality has certainly improved but we are still seeing problems in larger cities. We are seeing a transition to electric vehicles but it＊s not quick enough 每 more and more people are residing in cities, which means more people are contributing to and being exposed to pollution in urban areas.§"																																																			
"ssessing the rook population in the  has long been a favourite ritual of my springs. Since the nests are coarse bundles of sticks in the bare treetops it is easy to combine the serious census work with the season＊s wider pleasures: the sounds of first chiffchaffs or blackcaps, the lemon wings of male brimstone butterflies, and the year＊s first glamorous colour from primroses, marsh marigolds and walls of blackthorn blossom.However, by the time I reached the third of my 30 , I sensed that this year would be different. A site that had once held 100 nests was completely empty. Thereafter, each old place revealed the new story of absence. The most telling came in two strips of mainly  that fringe the valley where the rivers  and Yare converge. This is England＊s largest area of lowland grazing marsh and, since rooks are primarily consumers of grassland invertebrates, the whole sea-like expanse of uninterrupted green has traditionally been heaven for the birds.There are six rookeries either side of , which average 283 nests each. In combination and until 2007 they held 1,697 pairs, probably the highest rook density in East Anglia. Ten years later their combined total is 696, a fall of 59%. The most compelling moment was when I reached Thorpe Hall near Haddiscoe, where 340 pairs once nested. Its five-acre alder coppice is probably my favourite rookery anywhere, and in its pomp some of the trees were smothered in a continuous layer of nests. It is the only site where I＊ve found rooks nesting in the tops of hawthorn bushes. Such was their urge to share the raucous, joy-filled traffic that it seemed as if birds would nest anywhere just to be part of it. This spring there is not one.The decline across all 30 rookeries is not so steep, with a fall of  42% from 3,253 pairs to 1,890. It is hard to know exactly what has happened during the 10 years, but I suspect it could be drier springs and summers. One fact, however, is definite: something is amiss with the Yare valley rooks."																																																			
"The first 100 days of President Donald Trump: how has my life changed? First of all, there was the mourning period. Not for me, but for my fellow citizens. I was just mad. And I wasn＊t even maddest at the Trump voters. I understood that the critical battle lines now are not left versus right, but the 1% neoliberal globalisers making off with all of the loot and disembowelling the middle class. So when I saw the campaign, I knew that in the US, just as in the UK, a candidate who said anything at all about people forgotten in the neoliberal race would have a solid chance.No 每 I was mad at my own leftwing tribe. All of January, people on the left would confront me with dazed, grief-stricken expressions, as if they had just emerged from a multi-car pileup on a foggy highway.  I couldn＊t even bear to participate in those conversations. Finally I started explaining my rage to my closest friends.I had been screaming about the possibility of this very moment for eight years, since I published a piece in the  titled ※§ and wrote a book based on it, called  (2007). Under George Bush Jr, the left had been very receptive to the book＊s message about how democracies are undermined by the classic tactics of would-be authoritarians.But once Obama was elected 每 ※one of ours§ 每 I had to spend the next eight years yelling like a haunted Cassandra, to a room the left had abandoned. I had yelled myself hoarse for eight years under Obama about what it would mean for us to sit still while  to take out US citizens in extrajudicial killings; what it would mean for us to sit still while he passed the 2012 National Defence Authorisation Act that let any president hold citizens for ever without charge or trial; what it would mean for us to sit still while he allowed , allowed Guant芍namo to stay open, and allowed hyped terrorism stories to hijack the constitution and turn the US into what finally even Robert F Kennedy Jr was calling .For eight years, under Obama, my audiences were libertarian cowboys and red-state truckers; members of the military and police forces, who were appalled by what they were witnessing; and even conservatives, worried about our legacy of freedom. My usual audience, the shoppers at Whole Foods and drivers of hybrid cars, the educated left, my people, sat smugly at home while the very pillars of American democracy were being systematically chipped away. They were watching  and tending their heirloom tomato patches on weekends in the Hudson Valley, because everything was OK; yeah, he may OK drone strikes, but they can＊t be that bad, since he was one of ※ours§ 每 a handsome, eloquent African American, a former community organiser 每 in the Oval Office. Seduced by the image of a charming black man on Air Force One who talked about ※change§ 每 a white woman in a pantsuit (though highly paid by Goldman Sachs) talking about ※that highest, hardest glass ceiling§ 每 the left slumbered while US democracy was undone brick by brick by brick.So my feeling, the first inaugural month of 2017, as the left , was: you are worried? you want action? that the separation of powers is a joke and the constitution has collapsed around your ears, you point a finger at Trump and say, ※Sudden Catastrophe?§He didn＊t do this. You did this.Your own inaction and willingness to be seduced by two-bit identity politics labels, without actually doing the hard work of being patriots and defending the actual constitution 每 brought us exactly, exactly here.I had sought for eight years to explain to my own people, to no avail, this: it is not that important who sits in the White House if the structures of democracy are strong. If the structures of democracy are strong 每 you can have a madman or madwoman for four years or even eight, and then he or she is gone, and the nation＊s freedoms live.But if you take an eight-year nap snoozing through a systematic dismantling of the structures of democracy 每 freedoms of speech; independence of the press; separation of powers; fourth amendment rights to privacy; and allow the suspension of due process under the guise of ※fighting the war on terror§ 每 hell yeah, some day you will wake up and there will be a crazy man or a strongman in the White House and then nothing you do or say will make a difference any more.So yeah, Month One: I had nightly glasses of red wine to dull my rage at my own feeble delusional kind, and avoided the collective liberal ※mourning conversation§.Month Two: February was the month of OMG! Or else, WTF! I was part of it too, as Pres Trump＊s new-to-us-all methods of exploding Twitter bombs, engaging in scary political theatre, committing daily acts of apparent, um, economic treason, and doing it all at a bewilderingly fast pace, demanded a learning curve from us all. It was a sense of chaos, destabilisation. OMG! He issued a travel ban. OMG! People are held en masse at Newark 每 New York City taxi drivers are boycotting the airport because of the ban! OMG, Uber is profiting on picking up those rides! OMG, now we have to boycott Uber! WTF! He is rounding up immigrants! OMG 每 he is separating families at the border! WTF 每 did ? Isn＊t that illegal? WTF! Are Chinese influence-mongers really lining up at Mar-a-Lago to ingratiate themselves with the president＊s son-in-law? WTF 每  of any budget to keep the air and water clean? OMG 每 did he just say he doesn＊t believe in global warming? There was a stream of statelier edits from Congress, as the nation＊s ※WTF?§ reaction evolved into: can he really do that? Ben Cardin, the Democratic senator for Maryland, proposed a Senate resolution that Pres Trump obey the emoluments clause of the constitution, which forbids bribery (Trump had refused to put his holdings in a blind trust). States began to pass laws, such as those , to fight back against measures that Trump was taking federally. My day-to-day life was spent at our tech company, , training a group of young people to write about legislation, Congress and statehouses, and putting out news stories, blogs and opinion pieces following these developments. DailyClout is incubated in a cool space in Manhattan called Civic Hall, which is funded by Microsoft, Google and Omidyar Networks, where we are surrounded by others 每 mostly idealistic millennials 每 who are also building exciting new tools for new kinds of civic engagement.Month Three: in March, we all began to see a massive grassroots ※resistance§. I personally don＊t like that term, because you use that term to fight a completed fascist takeover; it gives democracy＊s opponents too much power; right now we have a battered democracy on life support that needs defending from those who wish to pull the plug.March was the month that dozens of new entities devoted to mobilising citizen action emerged from the collective shock. There were so many forms of new organising and funding: online candidate training seminars to  grants for new tools to get public and municipal records to people. Existing ※civic tech§ sites such as  and  were joined in March by a slew of new tools and sites put together by this powerful wave of activism. Our collective missions got boosted with jet fuel by the huge burst in ordinary citizens wanting and needing to take action. New platforms ranged from  每 which came out of the experience of volunteers in the Clinton campaign and which sends you political action steps to take in five phone calls 每 to , a similar service, which emerged out of Creative Majority, a Pac that supports Democratic candidates, and , set up by Steve Ballmer, formerly of Microsoft, which compiles and crunches federal, state and local data from government sources. My own life mission didn＊t reorient, since I had cofounded DailyClout＊s platform in 2010. But use of our civic engagement tools skyrocketed. Our first product, called , lets you search a database of live state and federal bills, then pop a live bill into your blog or news articles; it lets you interact with the bills in real time and share them socially. We also created RSS feeds to stream live state and federal legislation right into the websites of local, regional and national news sites, and the websites of elected officials. In March we boosted our blog stream and videos covering new state and federal legislation, and started to report on what people could do locally to push forward their issues. Our sites on social media grew by triple and quadruple digits.I presented these tools in March to news outlets and candidates and campaigns around the country 每 from Maine to Ohio to Oregon. I felt as if I was rediscovering my own nation, as the people in it were rediscovering belatedly how precious and fragile democracy was, and how much it depends on an informed citizenship. We were invited to demo it in a senate office; we visited Congress too, for our first exclusive interview, with Representative French Hill of Arkansas; I had never before been inside the Senate office building, or the Congress＊s Longworth House Office Building. It was uplifting and moving to me. I also saw that elected officials worried about democracy, and wanting to empower real citizens, existed on both sides of the aisle.We got our widget embedding live bills into news outlets totalling 160 million readers. In Q1 of 2017, 113,000 people searched BillCam to look at bills that would affect them 每 that they could now affect in turn. There are still shocking days 每 ,  每 but we stay focused.An amazing thing happened in March. The distinguished technologist George Polisner 每who quit his senior-level role at Oracle in a , covered widely in the US press, in which he demurred from Oracle＊s CEO＊s intention of ※working with President Trump§ 每 had started ※ , a social platform, privacy protected so citizens can organise without fear of a corporate-buyout Big Brother. Polisner and DailyClout joined forces in March. We＊re working to combine Civ.Works＊ power of organising with the power of DailyClout＊s streaming digital updates via RSS feeds, blogs and video, about local and federal legislation. No wonder I feel excited about the future.Am I happy about the present? I feel incredibly energised, hopeful and certain that if enough citizens, in our democracy and worldwide, wake up (as they are) and are able to get hold of real tools to use democracy 每 and those best-case tools are now digital and link to social and digital media 每 we can indeed be in the midst of what another president called ※a new birth of freedom§. Where I live, every day, on the frontlines of this digital revolution, there is every reason to feel in spired. That doesn＊t mean I am ※happy§ about where the nation is 每 I am extremely scared, just as I am scared about the future of Europe in a parallel assault on its democracies.But the biggest threat in the US or the UK isn＊t one political party or candidate. It is people＊s ignorance about their own democracies and their till-now lack of real-life tools to protect them. DailyClout UK and DailyClout EU are next on our list of planned launches: the UK legislative database is totally unsearchable, and the UK Parliament＊s own website ends in dead links when you try to find actual legislation. The EU website tells you with difficulty what bills have passed but doesn＊t show you what is coming up, when you might possibly take action 每 it offers a feed of pointless press releases instead. This lack of legislative transparency and usability had a lot to do, I believe, with the Brexit vote.Months Four, Five and Six will see more and more of these tools 每 from dozens of T-shirt-clad bespectacled tech revolutionaries, coming online. Geeks are the new patriots, and code is the new ※shot heard round the world§.As soon as we sang the first chorus of the hymn, the tears started. ※Here I go again,§ I thought, ※crying in church.§ This was three weeks ago. And the week before, and the week before that, all the way back to last November＊s election.Sudden emotional outbursts are how I＊m able to understand what Donald Trump＊s presidency means to me. I wasn＊t disconnected to these emotions before, but it＊s the unexpected and potent nature that has changed.I＊m in no immediate danger from the Trump presidency. I＊m not fearing deportation, the loss of my healthcare, a racially motivated arrest. I haven＊t been personally attacked online or in the real world. So when I get scared and start crying, I wonder what it would feel like to be in that more vulnerable position, and I＊m more distressed by the damage being done.My lens on Trump stems from work in the climate movement. My vantage point is as executive director of , a global effort to build a social movement that can confront the power of the fossil-fuel industry and accelerate our transition to 100% renewable energy.Trump stands in direct opposition to those goals. As president, he has wholeheartedly taken the side of the oil, coal, and gas industry and is already seeing to it that their agenda is enacted. Previous US presidents and candidates also did business with this industry, but at the same time they decried the threat of climate destabilisation, worked actively to secure international diplomatic alliances leading to an agreement, and achieved some progress from the executive branch.Before Trump＊s election, the climate movement had made some serious progress. Thanks to the good work of movements around the world, the social licence of this industry is on the decline. Investors are pulling their dollars, banks are cancelling loans, and public support for fossil-fuel companies is low.Ditto for the politicians who back them up. Take  45% of his constituents, not unacquainted with his ties to the oil industry, were less inclined to vote for Smith when as chair of the house science committee he failed to investigate ExxonMobil＊s alleged climate cover-up. (350.org is under subpoena from Smith＊s office for our efforts to get the truth out about Exxon.) From the political arena to our energy markets, it felt like the tide was finally beginning to turn in our direction.But then along came Donald Trump to declare climate change a hoax (the only head of state in the world to do so), promising to revive the coal industry (declining in the US, thanks to terrific organising), and appointing known climate-change deniers to head the very offices responsible for regulating the problem.When Trump won, a new kind of despair settled over climate activists. We＊re pretty accustomed to despair already 每 climate grief circles have started up in Australia, home to devastating heatwaves, fires, drought, and a basically  每 but this felt like something new.One week after the election, I was at a gathering with movement leaders across the faith, labour, LGBTQ and reproductive justice movements. We were each asked to write down one hard truth about the election that we hadn＊t yet said out loud. One person wrote: ※The small window of time we had to dramatically reduce emissions may have just closed.§At the very time when we need to be taking great leaps forward, Trump and his allies are dragging us backwards with an ideology that puts corporate power above all else 每 and you＊d be hard pressed to find a set of corporations more desperate to hold on to power than the likes of Exxon, Chevron and numerous coal and gas companies with less brand recognition.At least now there＊s no mystery about what we＊re up against: the full political might of the fossil-fuel industry. Two examples register highly on that score. The first is the appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO  as secretary of state. The second is the construction of the .The Tillerson appointment stands out because even the most cynical and pessimistic among us didn＊t predict that a person at the pinnacle of ※big oil§ would be in charge of diplomacy in the Trump regime. As my colleague Bill McKibben has said, you might as well ask Ronald McDonald to head up the Department of Agriculture. And Exxon isn＊t just any oil company: it has hidden what it knew about climate change, as early as the late 1970s, in order to continue making money on a product it knew was wrecking the planet. It funded climate-denying thinktanks and retained the same firms that helped tobacco companies claim that nicotine isn＊t addictive. It should be bad enough to have the , but the state post provides Tillerson and Exxon with far too much temptation to officially use the US foreign policy apparatus to keep extracting more oil.The night I saw that Trump suggested Tillerson for the post, I burst into tears and crawled into bed. It was a feeling close to panic, in recognition of what might happen and how powerless I felt. Thank goodness I＊m part of a big team, some of whom love battle and were quick to start writing and producing statements denouncing his appointment. Reports came out last week that of all the cabinet members, Tillerson is doing the best job keeping a close relationship to the president. Because this man is used to operating in secrecy, we＊ll have to stay vigilant to understand the moves he＊ll be making.Then there is the remarkable story about the Dakota Access pipeline and the historic resistance at Standing Rock. At no other time has there been this much widespread opposition to a pipeline, for the many reasons pipelines merit our opposition. This represented an alliance of tribes whose rights, livelihoods and lives have been systematically desecrated by the US government and corporations. The camp at Standing Rock itself was a symbol of everything Trumpism cannot be: spiritually grounded, connected to history and land, fundamentally respectful of the rights of nature and peoples, infused with art and music and heart. It moved people to act in solidarity all over the world. Many moved money out of the banks invested in the project.And the resistance worked. The forces at Standing Rock peacefully made sure that the Obama administration put a stop to the construction and allowed further review of the pipeline＊s viability.So it was with cruelty 每 the same cruelty seen in the enactment of the Muslim travel ban and the gamble with the  每 that Trump signed an . At the end of March, . This is why I＊m still crying in church. The minute I start to feel numb, I believe I＊ll lose some hope and resolve.And there is another animating goal. Progressives share so much, but so often our human nature and lopsided structures get in the way. Can we use this moment to be honest with each other in a new and different way, and clear up longstanding disagreements and inequalities that enable us to be aligned behind a common vision? Because I believe we will take power back. And when that happens, we need to enact a very bold agenda that catapults political possibilities far, far away from where Trump has dragged them.This work is already under way: it＊s the work of conversations between unions and environmentalists; large, well-funded organisations and smaller grassroots ones; centrist and more radical activists; and those who believe change comes from disrupting unjust laws and those whose work is to pass just ones.It＊s the work of the , which will take place on Saturday, 29 April in Washington DC and throughout the rest of the country. Its message aspires to the future we＊re trying to build, and it＊s being organised by a diverse cross-section of the entire movement.That tearful day in church ended on a high note. Afterwards, some friends and I went to New York＊s MoMA PS1 museum to see  perform. Rev Sekou is a Pentecostal minister, an author and a gospel and blues musician, who has been active in the . Yes, I went to church twice that day, and no, that isn＊t the norm for me! And when he sang ※What a time to be alive, the revolution has come§, I didn＊t feel like crying 每 I felt like getting back to work.20 January 2017 marked a turning point for the entire world. Since the election results were announced on 8 November 2016 I＊d been feeling mostly numb, unable to process what the impact would be for me, my family and the people I care about. I felt the need to be quiet, to be somewhere quiet. To have space to think.Every step I took felt like walking on eggshells. The first few weeks after the election everyone around me seemed to be unsure, fearful and riddled with anxiety. I was too. Quick to lash out, slow to listen. I had nothing to start from except what I＊d heard during the campaign.And yet, at the same time, I did know what was coming. Perhaps somewhere my cells were reorganising to protect my heart from what was inevitable. More suffering, more uncertainty. More people dying for trying to live. During the campaign, the surrogates for our current president unabashedly attacked Black Lives Matter activists as ※terrorists§ and ※cop killers§. In the aftermath of the election, there were many different responses. Some decided to continue their work as before and felt that not much had changed. Others decided to demonstrate their resistance by doing a direct action at the inauguration. Others shared information about the key players in the incoming administration, attempting to support others in the network to understand more clearly the new political agenda. All of us remain committed to the work of black liberation.During the holidays, my family and I talked over dinner about personal security. I described to them a new set of protocols we would need to begin using in order to ensure our safety, insofar as that was even possible. My parents described their fear of what was to come. A lawsuit filed by a rabid conservative former district attorney hung over our heads as someone charged us and other activists with ※starting a race war§. Indeed, the election of Donald Trump was like a nuclear plume slowly rising over the United States.What I＊ve learned in the first 100 days of this administration is that you can never stop dreaming about freedom. I＊ve spent the past few months being relatively quiet. Listening. Brushing up on my reading about the right wing in the United States and the movement it has been diligently building for the past 30 years. I＊ve taken to a practice of listening more and also listening less. Listening more to what＊s  being said, watching as the various factions on the right joust for power and influence. I＊ve taken stock of the damage, as the right wing now controls the presidency, the supreme court, Congress and the majority of state legislatures. Listening less to voices that refuse to deal with our political reality as it actually is, as opposed to how they want it to be.The low points over the past few months have been many. Executive order after executive order that sought to punish the communities that make America great 每 Muslims, undocumented immigrants, black people, women, queer communities, transgender people. A ※law and order§ agenda that seeks to criminalise anyone who disagrees with the administration＊s aims. An attorney general who . A  who seeks to privatise public education. A secretary of housing and urban development who seeks to slash an already paper-thin budget for housing set aside for those . A who is responsible not just for advising the president, but who, to all intents and purposes, is the one pushing the many decisions that this so-called president espouses on television. And of course, the recent  and . Certainly, we are in for a long fight and not all of us will make it.I comfort my parents who are concerned about . They＊re both in their 60s and have recently retired. And so, while the Affordable Care Act isn＊t perfect, it is what they have and it is what they depend on. And it is what they deserve, what every human being on this Earth deserves 每 to be cared for.And yet I am hopeful. The disorganisation of our political landscape offers abundant opportunities for new strategies and a transformation in the way we care for one another. I welcome the opportunity to be closer to my neighbours, to fight for myself, my family and my loved ones with every fibre of my being. Inside of the quiet, the cynicism dissipates. We have no choice other than to fight back, to take back what was always flawed but still holds the promise of what could be.I remember that the resistance is real and it lives. The day before the president is inaugurated, I join more than  for many, this was their first time on a demonstration. When the president followed orders from his chief strategist to institute a travel ban on Muslims,  and those caught in the crosshairs of such a ridiculous endeavour were given legal support and reunited with their families. I work with the , a prominent voice and political vehicle for the millions of domestic workers in the United States who are still excluded from most federal labour protections 每 and so when the president initially nominated a man for secretary of labour who was , we participated in the resistance to stop him from being confirmed. Representatives returned to their home districts and were forced to face their constituents in ways that they haven＊t had to in decades.And so, while there are many challenges to overcome, it is good to know that we are not alone in attempting to find the solutions necessary to save our lives and the lives of millions who are vulnerable not just in the United States, but around the world. Wherever there is oppression, there is resistance. I＊m happy to know which side I＊m on.I live in the heart of Trump country, in Meigs County, Ohio, a rural county struggling with poverty and addiction. My neighbours are precisely the people the right wing have been preying on and propagandising while the left abandoned them for decades. I wasn＊t terribly surprised to see Clinton had lost. I＊d just published  about why so many people would be voting for Trump. But I wept on election night and then got well and truly drunk, because I didn＊t want to think about what was coming next.My household is bracing for disaster. I wrote a book, , about what a precarious life feels like, but this is the first time I＊ve felt precarity coming in my bones and also had enough income to assuage my fears of: not enough food, not enough warmth, not enough anything on hand to deal with an emergency. I have a garden, as anyone in the country does, but we got serious about it after the election. This is the first year I＊ve thought that food prices will spike enough to make it worth focusing on the garden as a food source, not just a hobby. Increased immigration raids will likely leave food rotting in the fields and shipping costs will probably go up as they do during periods of uncertainty; imported food will be more expensive.And the more the country talked about Russia, the more sense it made to expand the plans we had for a few tomatoes and beans to include asparagus and maybe some root vegetables because they＊ll keep just fine. The logic: oil and power costs tend to spike when Russia＊s doing a thing and we＊re bombing the Middle East. Then we thought: maybe berry bushes. A few fruit trees. And a herb patch. And maybe we should borrow a tiller at this point or buy one? Just now, I＊m mapping out two weeks of my schedule around harvest time so I can be home to do the food preservation. We＊re not about freeze-dried food storage yet; right now people are still only joking about nukes.Besides, this part of the country＊s turning into a rainforest. A decade ago this part of Ohio didn＊t reach such high temperatures. Now summers are lush and humid, while winters are becoming harsher. So it＊s not such a bad idea, if you happen to have the land and the time to get the work done, to be working on sustainability. Partially that＊s environmentalism, but it＊s an economic consideration too. It＊s a thing we talk about over dinner at home or with friends. We also talk about power. Electricity is expensive, so is heating oil, and gas ain＊t free either. Power will only get more expensive as regulations are rolled back and the market is left to its own devices. Water is already a scarce commodity. Might as well put in some solar panels if you can afford it.I spent the weeks between the election and the inauguration mostly glued to Twitter. I tried to help people reason through what had just happened. I impatiently explained the philosophical and historical definition of fascism versus the hyperbolic version. I demanded we all grow up and focus on the important stuff: not what had happened, but what was coming. My audience grew and split into groups 每 people who liked my satirical round-ups of the incoming administration＊s peccadilloes, people who liked that I discussed the reasons we were vulnerable to a demagogue, people who just wanted someone to explain what the hell had happened.I started taking more note of political conversation I heard around me, too, here in rural Ohio, where they went for Trump hard. Consensus seemed to be building that voting Trump hadn＊t worked but as it was a last-ditch attempt anyway, it was worth waiting to see. Nobody quite agreed on what he was supposed to have done or, rather, there were a lot of things. Mostly, he was supposed to have disrupted everything 每 but not exactly like this. He needed to get off that stupid Twitter, anyway, everyone agreed on that. I keep wondering what these people didn＊t learn from the Tea Party.Once the inauguration was over, I largely quit trying to explain anything to anyone online; emotion was riding too high and we were back to breaking news instead of analysis and I was planning a garden, so I started joking that no matter what happened, at least I had fertile land and a defensible perimeter. When the kids weren＊t listening, we talked about what guns to buy.Between the realisation that we were moving into a time of instability and trying to keep up with the daily domestic outrages, I couldn＊t muster the energy to care about who had what ties with Russia. As far as I could tell, nobody knew anything concrete and it was all an expenditure of nervous tension, something tangible to turn like a Rubik＊s Cube. I watched friends I respect come to personal attacks over whether Bernie or Hillary would have been better, instead of concentrating on the task at hand, which was: we damn well did have Trump.If we could find someone to blame, we could avoid blaming ourselves: I watched it all spin around me and decided it wasn＊t for me. I was going to concentrate on writing a book instead, paying closer attention to the world around me. I hoped that maybe by writing it I could answer my own questions: how did we get to this point where we seem incapable of governing? Where is this division and can we heal it? Most important, how is everyone experiencing all this unrest? I have always had a difficult time drawing a line between journalism and activism. I just go places and watch things and I write about them. I am a curious sort and my readers tend to be interested in the same things I am. Which I suppose is why, when faced with a country I hardly recognise, my instinct is to set off around the nation asking people impertinent questions and share what they tell me with everyone else.Three months in, my neighbours who discuss politics in public and voted for Trump seem to be split between unreasonable partisan shills and people who voted for disruption because it was that or more of the same. It seems many people really were hoping that someone with no experience might 每 just maybe 每 do it differently. Only he＊s turning out to be worse than anyone we＊ve ever had so far and now discussion is turning to whether we even have a functioning government any more.It＊s a fight between what I know my country should be and what I see it turning into, which is the plaintive cry of all American millennials. I am 34 years old and I have watched my country poisoned by fear and hate, watched generations before me sell out my future and that of my children, watched us destroy the whole world＊s economy and within months get back to business as usual and record highs in the markets. I do not have youthful hope for America, not now, and certainly not in Trump＊s twisted version of freedom and progress where we hate and fear anyone who isn＊t exactly like us and we have no charity for a fellow citizen. I was no fan of Hillary Clinton either, but at least she was only likely to enrich herself and her friends within reasonable limits. I can understand wanting power for power＊s sake even if I wish leadership looked less like plutocracy. But I cannot, not fathom the intentional hollowing of everything I have been taught to cherish.I got a tattoo recently, for the first time since mid-2015. I get tattooed when I am wrestling with something very difficult, because I prefer to keep reminders than to learn lessons twice.

"yson＊s first Internet of Things fan, the Pure Cool Link, is also an air purifier that claims to be able to turn your pollution- or pollen-filled rooms into clean, hay-fever-free zones within minutes.It＊s the first in the new range of Link devices, which have Wi-Fi and connect to Dyson＊s Link app on Android or iOS, allowing remote control, monitoring and information.The theory behind the filtration is really quite simple. The Pure Cool Link pulls air through a fine mesh filter and fires it out through one of the company＊s air multiplier fan designs.The 360-degree glass HEPA filter can capture up to 99.95% of pollutants - anything over 0.1microns. In the air trapped in the filter there is pollen, spokes, smoke, dust and other irritants. The filter also has activated carbon, similar to that used in cooker hoods, to trap any chemicals in the air, thus removing smells and pollutants.The cleaned air is then piped through to the paperclip-like loop, directing the air forward with force and sucking air through the back of the loop as it does so, amplifying the airflow.There are two ways to control the Pure Link Cool. As with every other Dyson fan, there＊s a small infrared remote for turning on the fan, increasing or decreasing its power, setting it to oscillate or operate on a timer. There＊s also a button for putting it into night mode, which limits the fan strength to four or less and dims the LED display on the front.Pressing the ※auto§ button allows the fan to control itself in response to the quality of the air in the room at the time, turning on and cleaning the air when required.If you choose to the connect the fan to Wi-Fi 每 you do not have to 每 you can also control it using the Dyson Link app for Android or iOS. The app provides information on filter life, telling you when you need to change it 每 which is roughly once a year depending the quality of air in your house 每 and set schedules for it to run on a daily or weekly basis.Users can also get an instant reading of the air quality around the fan and the air quality outdoors, and a chart showing air quality throughout the day or week and how often the purifier was active. There are also air quality targets that you can change, grouped into ※good quality§, ※sensitive to particles and pollutants§ and ※very sensitive to particles and pollutants§, which the machine responds to when automatically cleaning the air.Using it is incredibly simple. Put it in your desired spot, plug it in, connect it to Wi-Fi using the app, which runs through a quick step-by-step guide then either hit the button the remote to set the fan in motion or switch it into automatic.As a purifier it works very well. It＊s quite robust, so moving it from place to place 每say in the living room in the during the day and bedroom at night 每 isn＊t a problem. Appreciatively clearing a small living room of pollen for a hay fever suffer took only around 20 minutes or so and with the purifier set to automatic, it maintained a pollen-free haven even at the heights of suffering.It also removed smells quite effectively and while kept under level four out of 10 fan speed, was quiet enough to not disrupt TV watching or similar. There were occasions where the fan would kick up to level six or so, if not put into night mode, which made hearing dialogue difficult without high volumes.As a fan the Pure Cool Link isn＊t as effective as the Dyson＊s other models. At the same fan speed it seems to push a smaller volume of air, meaning that to cool you from across the room requires it to be turned up pretty high. On level 10, the airflow is relatively strong, but it makes a lot of noise doing it, making it hard to do anything else in the room at the same time. It cannot compete with the airflow of an old Panasonic 60cm, high-quality bladed fan for air flow.The Dyson Pure Cool Link purifier fan costs ?350 for a circular desk model and ?450 for the larger oval tower as tested here, which places it at the high end of the market, in-line with the company＊s other fans, heaters and humidifiers. Air purifiers are available from around ?50 and up.The ?50 filter will need to be changed once a year when the fan is run for 12 hours a day, of which the machine will notify users through the app and display.The Dyson Pure Cool Link is a premium air purifier and fan that delivers. The merits of air purification and the need for it in British homes can be debated, but there＊s no doubt the purifier works. It rapidly cleans the air in any room you put it in, keeps it clean and provides much needed respite for allergy suffers, particularly in the summer months.It isn＊t the best fan in the world, though, making a significant amount of noise when pushed to the limit, but is pretty quiet at low levels and easily quiet enough to not disrupt my sleep.The connected app is really interesting, and gives you a visual readout of what it＊s been doing all day when left in automatic, while the small hand remote makes controlling it from bed or the sofa easy.It＊s certainly a standout statement in any room, but whether that ease of use and design is worth the price depends on how much you value air quality or whether you suffer from allergies. Other purifiers will probably do as good a job for significantly less money, but its likely none do it while looking as good."																																																			
																																																			
"The UK may be on its way out of the EU but more than three-quarters (76%) of people want clean air zones to bring their cities into line with European standards, according to a YouGov poll.The poll comes as new forecasting suggests London will still breach the limits for another 14 years without further action and the mayor of , Sadiq Khan, prepares to make a major speech on pollution-cutting measures on Tuesday. from exposure to pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter, and many more fall victim to illnesses ranging from heart attacks to bronchitis. Dozens of British cities . ※This research demonstrates just how big an issue air quality has become,§ said Dan Byles, the chairman of the Clean Air Alliance, which commissioned the research. ※As awareness of the scale of the problem and evidence of pollution＊s impact on our health has grown, people have become justifiably concerned.§Air pollution is rising up the political agenda in the wake of the VW emissions scandal, and as the health impacts of dirty air become clearer.  linked air pollution to increased mental illness and children for the first time, and last week  that nearly 90 secondary schools in London are exposed to illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide.YouGov polled more than 800 people in Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham and Southampton, where the government plans to  by 2020, as well as in London, where an ※ultra low emissions zone§ is planned. Only 11% of people opposed using taxation and charges to drive polluting vehicles off the roads, and just 17% said they would be less likely to buy from a company that made low-emission vehicles 每 even if this made them more expensive.Toby Peters, the chief executive of Dearman, a clean tech company which supported the poll, said: ※We are clearly at a crossroads and people across the country aren＊t just calling for a change of direction. Many are now willing to back companies and authorities that demonstrate leadership. This will only continue to gather momentum.§Forecasting this week for the Greater London Authority has also found that parts of the capital 每 including the city centre, Heathrow and major roads 每 would still be above the annual limits for NO2 by 2030.The modelling suggests Londoners will have to put up with dirty and dangerous air for much longer than central government＊s environment department, which forecasts the city will be compliant with the limits by 2025.Boris Johnson had proposed an Ultra Low Emissions Zone (Ulez) for central London to come into force in 2020, but in May  he would more than double the size of the zone and try to introduce it earlier. The modelling for NO2 limits is based only on the previous measures outlined by Johnson.Khan said: ※This data is further proof that the lacklustre measures proposed by the previous mayor would not have gone far enough to clean up London＊s filthy air.§The mayor will launch a public consultation on the expanded Ulez at Great Ormond Street hospital on Tuesday, the 60th anniversary of the Clean Air Act.While the UK today mostly suffers problems with NO2, an invisible toxic gas produced by diesel vehicles, the act was brought in to tackle smoke from coal burning that created the ※great smogs§ of the 1950s.The Liberal Democrats have written to the environment secretary, Liz Truss, calling on her to ensure a post-Brexit Britain maintains EU air quality standards.※I urge you to ensure that in coming Brexit negotiations, the UK government follows through on EU agreements to tackle air pollution and enshrines essential limits into British law. Leaving the EU must not be used as a way to water down vital air quality legislation. ※Do not betray the legacy of the Clean Air Act by allowing the UK to become the dirty man of Europe once again,§ says the letter, signed by the party＊s environment and transport spokespeople, Baroness Parminter and Baroness Randerson, and Catherine Bearder MEP.Mary Creagh, the Labour MP and chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, said she feared that outside of the EU 每 without the stick of the UK facing EU fines for breaching air quality 每 the new political reality was that the government would be unlikely to act on air pollution.※A new Clean Air Act is now needed for the 21st century. One that limits diesel pollution and ensures that government, nationally, regionally and locally, prioritises the policies needed to clear the air in our towns and cities.§Other campaigners are also expected to use the anniversary to call for a new Act and for all local authorities to have the ability to create clean air zones.James MacColl, head of campaigns at the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ※60 years on from the Clean Air Act tens of thousands of people are still dying every year from the effects of air pollution. With road transport a major polluter, the government urgently needs to reduce the number of vehicles on our roads.§Harry Quilter-Pinner, a research fellow at the IPPR thinktank said: ※Today, our air may look cleaner but it is both lethal and illegal. This time round it＊s the combustion engine, and in particular diesels cars, vans and buses, which are killing thousands of people up and down the country. As a result, the government should take bold action now to start phasing out the use of diesel cars.§"																																																			
																																																			
" has begun the process of rolling back carbon pollution standards for vehicles following a meeting with automakers in Detroit, Michigan. Trump has directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review fuel efficiency standards that were a key plank of Barack Obama＊s effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The move is a victory for carmakers who have claimed the standards are too onerous and out of step with Americans＊ car buying habits.※These standards are costly for automakers and the American people,§ said the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt.※We will work with our partners at the department of transport to take a fresh look to determine if this approach is realistic. This thorough review will help ensure that this national program is good for consumers and good for the environment.§In an agreement struck with automakers in 2012, the  required that cars run 54.4 miles per gallon of fuel by 2025. This standard, up from 27.5 miles per gallon, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6bn tons over the lifetime of new vehicles and save 2m gallons of oil per day by 2025. In the final month of Obama＊s presidency, the EPA  in a midterm review that automakers are ※well positioned§ to meet the new standard. Trump is ordering a review of this finding, opening the way for a weaker standard to be drawn up. The White House said the new review will ※rely on the best available data and information, which the previous administration ignored§. A White House official said the automakers feel the EPA ※shoved it down their throats§ and that the standards needed to be redone. ※The process was very short-circuited,§ said the Trump official, who spoke anonymously before the president＊s announcement. ※There was a lot of data that was submitted, and I think it is fair to say the Obama EPA just ignored it.§ Trump unveiled the review at an event in Detroit where he met with executives from companies, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat. The president said he was going to ※bring a lot of jobs back to Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania§.Dennis Williams, president of the United Auto Workers union, raised concerns about the environmental impact of more loose fuel efficiency standards. In response, Trump said: ※We all agree with you 100%. One hundred percent. We want you to make great cars, but if it takes an extra thimble of fuel, we want you to do it.§  Former EPA officials and environmental groups have decried the reversal, pointing out that carmakers had previously complained about fuel efficiency standards only to easily meet the requirements due to the evolution of technology. There are already more than 100 car and SUV models that meet standards that stretch beyond 2020, with the Chevrolet Volt, Toyota Prius, Chevrolet Spark and Smart ForTwo already matching the 2025 standard.  American drivers are also set to lose out, with the Obama rules forecast to save an average of $8,000 on gasoline costs for a new car. ※We need to put clean car standards in the fast lane to keep our air clean and our climate safe,§ said Michael Brune, executive director of environmental group, the Sierra Club. ※Donald Trump and the automakers are endangering the health of our children and families by abolishing lifesaving vehicle emissions protections that cut down on dangerous smog pollution and asthma attacks.§Kristin Igusky, climate program associate at the World Resources Institute, added: ※There＊s no doubt that the current standards are reasonable and achievable. In fact, the industry as a whole has surpassed the vehicle standards , while creating jobs and selling more vehicles than ever.§Carmakers welcomed the review. Mitch Bainwol, president and chief executive of trade lobby group, Auto Alliance, said:By restarting this review, analysis rather than politics will produce a final decision.§ Trump＊s rolling back of fuel efficiency standards is set to be followed by further actions to dismantle climate policies enacted by Obama. The administration is set to lift a moratorium on coalmining on federal land and start to unpick various climate rules, including the Clean Power Plan, which imposes emissions limits on the states. Trump is also mulling whether to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord. On Wednesday, an  took out ads in Washington DC publications to urge Trump to stay in the deal and work towards a low-carbon economy.

One reason is that effective, practical environmentalism is anathema to the very essence of the leave campaign. Dealing with the environmental challenges of the future 每 be they climate change, the destruction of nature or deadly air pollution 每 requires countries to collaborate, cooperate and yes, at times, compromise.It＊s hard to see where such principles fit into a leave campaign predicated on a sensationalised fear of the other and ideas about British exceptionalism, and victory bonfires of ※red tape§.

"The survival of the  hinges on urgent moves to cut global warming because nothing else will protect coral from the coming cycle of mass bleaching events, new research has found.The study of three mass bleaching events on Australian reefs in 1998, 2002 and 2016 found coral was damaged by underwater heatwaves regardless of any local improvements to water quality or fishing controls.The research, authored by 46 scientists and , raises serious questions about Australia＊s long-term conservation plan for its famous reef, which invests heavily in .The researchers said the findings of their paper, Global Warming and Recurrent Mass Bleaching of Corals, applied to coral reefs worldwide.Its publication comes the same day its lead author, Terry Hughes, is due to embark on an aerial survey to confirm the extent of another mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef.It is the , which suffered its worst ever damage in 2016 when .The study, which was unable to take in the effects of the latest event, warned a fourth mass bleaching event ※within the next decade or two§ gave the badly damaged northern section of the reef a ※slim§ chance of ever recovering to its former state.Hughes said the latest event, which was notable for having nothing to do with the warming effect of El Ni?o weather patterns, highlighted how research on mass bleaching, even when fast-tracked, was unable to keep pace with the reef＊s current state.※It broke my heart to see so many corals dying on northern reefs on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016,§ Hughes said.※With rising temperatures due to global warming, it＊s only a matter of time before we see . A fourth event after only one year would be a major blow to the reef.§Hughes said he hoped coming weeks would ※cool off quickly and this year＊s bleaching won＊t be anything like last year§.※The severity of the 2016 bleaching was off the chart.§Hughes, the convener of the National  Bleaching Taskforce, said the study clearly showed the need for climate change action in Australia＊s reef conservation plan.He said it also showed the folly of Australian and Queensland government support for one of the world＊s largest coalmines, , which will export coal in ships through reef waters.This was not only because of the , but also from dredging and marine traffic through the reef.※In its weakened state, the reef cannot afford the Adani mine,§ he said.The publication of the research comes the same week as Queensland government officials meet with Unesco officials in Paris to appeal for more time to make good on conservation efforts to ward off an . It also coincides with a visit by the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to India to lobby Adani to proceed with its mine plan.The study found that 91% of coral on the reef had suffered from bleaching over the past two decades.The researchers concluded that ※local management of coral reef fisheries and water quality affords little, if any, resistance to recurrent severe bleaching events: even the most highly protected reefs and near-pristine areas are highly susceptible to severe heat stress.§※On the remote northern Great Barrier Reef, hundreds of individual reefs were severely bleached in 2016 regardless of whether they were zoned as no-entry, no-fishing, or open to fishing, and irrespective of inshore每offshore differences in water quality.§Likewise, past exposure to bleaching, or relative resistance among certain corals to minor bleaching, gave no protection in the face of severe heat stress, the study found.Local protection of fish stocks and improved water quality ※may, given enough time, improve the prospects for recovery§.※However, bolstering resilience will become more challenging and less effective in coming decades because local interventions have had no discernible effect on resistance of corals to extreme heat stress, and, with the increasing frequency of severe bleaching events, the time for recovery is diminishing.※Securing a future for coral reefs, including intensively managed ones such as the Great Barrier Reef, ultimately requires urgent and rapid action to reduce global warming.§Bleaching comes when heat stress forces corals to expel tiny photosynthetic algae, which leaves them stark white.Prolonged heat stress will kill the corals, but death rates take at least six months to confirm.The researchers said fast-growing coral took 10-15 years to fully recover while longer-lived corals ※necessarily take many decades§.This kind of ※sustained absence of another severe bleaching event (or other significant disturbance) ＃ is no longer realistic while global temperatures continue to rise§, they said."																																																			
"A major new study has linked air pollution to increased mental illness in children, even at low levels of pollution.The new research found that relatively small increases in air pollution were associated with a significant increase in treated psychiatric problems. It is the first study to establish the link but is consistent with a growing body of evidence that air pollution can affect mental and cognitive health and that children are particularly vulnerable to poor air quality.The research, , examined the pollution exposure of more than 500,000 under-18s in Sweden and compared this with records of medicines prescribed for mental illnesses, ranging from sedatives to anti-psychotics. ※The results can mean that a lower concentration of air pollution, first and foremost from traffic, may reduce psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents,§ said Anna Oudin, at Ume? University, who led the study. ※I would be worried myself if I lived in an area with high air pollution.§Prof Frank Kelly, at King＊s College , said the research was important. ※This builds on existing evidence that children are particularly sensitive to poor air quality probably because their lifestyles increase the dose of air pollution they are exposed too - ie they are more active - and that developing organs may be more vulnerable until they fully mature.§Air pollution in the UK is above legal limits in many cities and estimated to cause 40,000 early deaths a year, though this only includes illnesses such as lung disease, heart attacks and strokes. The EU and WHO limit for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is 40mcg/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre), but levels can reach many times that in polluted cities like London. The researchers found that a 10mcg/m3 increase in NO2 corresponded to a 9% increase in mental illness in the children. For the same increase in tiny particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), the increase was 4%.One striking aspect of the new research is that  has low levels of air pollution, but the researchers still saw the link even below levels of 15mcg/m3. ※Sweden is not a country that suffers from very bad air quality, said Kelly. ※This suggests that other countries and cities have an even bigger challenge, as they will have to make significant improvements to their air quality so that it is even cleaner than Sweden＊s.§It is not possible to say from this study what would happen to rates of mental illness at higher levels of air pollution, but Oudin said they could rise: ※In all the air pollution studies I have been involved in, the effects seem to be linear.§This type of research cannot prove a causal link between the air pollution and increases in mental illness, but there is a plausible mechanism. ※We know air pollution can get into bodies and brains and cause inflammation,§ said Oudin. Animal studies indicate that inflammation is associated with a range of psychiatric disorders. There have also been several earlier studies that found associations between  and . ※This study adds to evidence that air pollution may have detrimental effects on the brains of children and adolescents,§ the Swedish researchers said.In May, the Guardian revealed an unpublished air pollution report that demonstrated that  and that four-fifths of those are in deprived areas. In May, a WHO report concluded that  in the world＊s cities, while a report in September found  around the world from air pollution.

But these giant floating playgrounds leave an enormous environmental impact.Many large ocean liners , which can stand at more than three stories tall and span the length of two school buses. This equipment, along with smaller auxiliary engines, can emit dangerous levels of sulfur dioxide. Curbing these emissions could prevent 14,000 premature, air pollution-related deaths and .According to a newly released Friends of the Earth＊s (Foe) , cruise line companies are mostly doing a poor job at reducing air and water pollution.Foe＊s report card, the sixth from the US nonprofit, assigned 17 cruise lines and their 171 ships a grade between A and F in four categories: sewage treatment, water quality, air pollution reduction and transparency. Some companies, like Disney Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line, earned an A in at least two categories. But most of them, such as Carnival Cruise Lines and Silversea Cruises, scored on the low end. Crystal Cruises and Costa  received mostly Fs.※The industry represents itself as a benefactor for the ocean, but we think that＊s not the case with all of these lines,§ said Marcie Keever, oceans and vessels program director at Foe. ※We want passengers to know they can make a change with their dollars.§Foe isn＊t alone in criticizing the environmental impact of cruise ships. While international rules are in place to regulate pollution, advocacy groups say these efforts aren＊t nearly enough. Residents in port cities,  plans to accommodate more cruise ships.The 2016 report card is the first since a dispute emerged between Foe and the Cruise Line International Association (Clia), which represents cruise companies in North America, over how Foe analyzed data. In 2014, Clia announced that it would to produce the scorecard, and its members followed suit. That prompted Foe to add ※transparency§ to the 2014 scorecard and give every company an F.Since then, one company has had a change of heart. By supplying data to Foe, Disney Cruise Line is the only company that got an A for transparency in the 2016 scorecard. Disney didn＊t respond to requests for comment.Clia hasn＊t changed its stance since 2014. In a statement to the Guardian, Clia called the report card ※unscientific§ and contended that Foe used ※outdated sources§.※Once again, it is regrettable that Foe has issued a report on the cruise industry that is misleading and inaccurate,§ the industry organization said.Foe found much of its information for the report online, Keever said. The sources included contractors who have installed waste treatment technologies and air purifiers on the ships. Keever said many of the ships from its 2014 scorecard remain in the fleets, so the information Foe had collected in the past should still be valid. But she admits this method of information gathering has its drawbacks.※I＊m sure this has mistakes,§ she said. ※Which is why we were hopeful [the cruise lines] would get back to us.§The new scorecard shows that companies have made the biggest improvement in reducing their air pollution by using newer technology. They made that switch in response to, which requires all ships sailing within 200 nautical miles of the US and Canada coastline to use cleaner fuel or install technology that reduces the sulfur content in emissions.Clia said its members have invested $1bn in new technologies and cleaner fuels, as well as $8bn to build ships fueled by natural gas, which are .While Foe gave companies higher grades of Bs and Cs instead of Ds and Fs from previous years for pollution control, it maintains that more can be done. For example, a scrubber that is commonly used to remove sulfur dioxide from a ship＊s smokestacks does not remove other particulates from the diesel engines, Keever said, adding that she would like to see cruise companies use filters that can do a better job of cleaning the exhaust.※We wanted to give them credit for installing technology that gets them part of the way, but they can be doing better,§ she said.The companies demonstrated the least improvement in their sewage treatment systems, said Keever. An average cruise ship carrying 3,000 passengers and crew generates 21,000 gallons of sewage a day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Many cruise lines are using outdated systems to filter their sewage, resulting in minimally treated sewage being dumped into the water, according to Keever. However, Keever praised Royal Caribbean for installing advanced technologies in 24 of its 25 ships that essentially use more filters.But installing new technologies doesn＊t mean cruise companies are using them, especially when they are further out in the sea and difficult to monitor, Keever noted.Foe hopes that pressure from advocacy groups and consumers will prompt cruise lines to provide more data and demonstrate improvements.※We＊re hopeful that Disney＊s willingness to respond to our information requests points to the beginnings of a sea change [by cruise companies to be] transparent about environmental responsibility,§ Keever said."

"Residents in tiny Uniontown, , are locked in a legal battle against a company that has dumped millions of tons of coal ash there and then filed suit for defamation against those protesting against the act.The residents formed a group, Black Belt Citizens Fighting for Health and Justice, to fight the placement of a landfill filled with the coal ash in their town that they say threatens their health and constitutes a racial injustice. Uniontown is 91% black, and is among the poorest communities in the nation: half the residents live below the poverty line.The company that owns the landfill, Georgia-based Green Group Holdings, has slapped four of the residents with a $30m lawsuit for defamation, objecting to the way they describe life on the edge of the 1,200-acre Arrowhead landfill.On Thursday morning the American Civil Liberties Union 每 whose co-founder was a Uniontown native 每 filed a motion in federal court to dismiss the suit, saying it goes against ※the very core of the first amendment§.※The residents are making statements of opinion, statements of emotion and passion which can＊t be penalized consistent with the first amendment,§ said ACLU senior attorney Lee Rowland. ※Green Group is using lawsuits to silence their critics.§Thirty million dollars, she said, is ※an unbelievably terrifying number§ in a town where the median per capita income is about $8,000 per year. ※It＊s our goal to ensure that they are not intimidated.§Green Group＊s suit alleges that the Black Belt Citizens group used its website and Facebook page ※in a false and malicious manner§ and that the group＊s leaders, Esther Calhoun and Benjamin Eaton, made ※knowingly false§ statements about the site. Green Group revealed its motives, Rowland said, when the company＊s lawyers approached the four plaintiffs before they sued them, : Green Group wanted access to their electronic devices, access to the group＊s future social media postings, and extensive details about Black Belt Citizens＊ membership, advocacy and communications with other environmental groups. The company also wanted apologies from each potential defendant and required them to withdraw as complainants in a federal civil rights complaint filed with the Environmental Protection Agency. ※It＊s an outrage. I＊m an attorney and I＊ve never seen anything quite like it. The company wants to force the residents not only to agree with them, but to become a mouthpiece for them,§ Rowland said. Officials at Green Group did not immediately return calls from the Guardian, but a statement on the company＊s website references the project: ※We take pride in our operation of the Arrowhead Landfill which, despite being the most inspected landfill in Alabama, has had zero notices of violation since opening in 2007,§ according to Ernest Kaufmann, Green Group＊s CEO.The conflict started in 2009, when the previous site holding the coal ash, in Kingston, Tennessee, suffered a catastrophic dam collapse, contaminating surrounding rivers, lakes and land with arsenic and lead.The Environmental Protection Agency said the disaster posed ※imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health§.Train cars carried the coal sludge 每 four million tons of it 每 south to Uniontown in Alabama. The town＊s historic graveyard sits adjacent to the landfill, and some residents claim that since the coal ash expansion they can＊t find some of the older graves.※They have been out in my ancestors＊ cemetery,§ said Esther Calhoun. The graveyard holds the remains of slaves, and was used as recently as 1996. Calhoun is a defendant in Green Group＊s suit, but she said the company may have miscalculated by bringing such a huge lawsuit against such poor people.※It kind of scares me less than people who have something to lose,§ she said. ※I can＊t even count that high. How can I come up with that kind of money?§She gave a rueful laugh. ※It＊s painfully funny,§ she said. When the wind blows, she said, foul smells waft up from the coal ash. ※My friend lived across the street from the landfill, and I couldn＊t even get to go visit her for the smell,§ she said. ※She didn＊t have air conditioning, so she sat out on her porch. She died recently. It used to be that living in the country you could sit on the front porch, hang your clothes out to dry, barbecue. All that has changed since the landfill.§Another of the defendants, Benjamin Eaton, told AL.com, ※We are tired of being taken advantage of in this community. The living around here can＊t rest because of the toxic material from the coal ash leaking into creeks and contaminating the environment, and the deceased can＊t rest because of desecration of their resting place.§ Now that the ACLU has filed for a dismissal of the suit there will be another month or so of back-and-forth responses with Green Group. Then the federal judge will decide whether to rule on the written motions or hear arguments in court.Rowland, the ACLU attorney, said she is prepared to go to court. ※We have impassioned witness testimony,§ she said. ※We are ready to go.§"

"The explosive wildfire in Canada＊s tar sands region that forced 90,000 people to flee last week is still burning. By Tuesday, ※the beast§ had grown to 230,000 hectares, but had moved into largely unpopulated regions east and south of the town of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Although officials have found 80-90% of the town undamaged, power and water is out, and about 2,400 homes and other buildings have been burned down. Fires in Canada＊s boreal forest are common, burning an average of 2m ha every year. What makes this one unique is its intensity and location in the heart of the tar sands fields. In addition to the estimated $9bn damage to Fort McMurray, the fire will have significant environmental impacts:※It＊s an extremely intense fire, the ecosystem will be massively changed,§ said Ellen Macdonald, a forest ecologist at the University of Alberta.The Fort McMurray area is mixed boreal forest with aspen, spruce and a lot of peatlands and normally quite wet. It＊s been very dry in recent years and the fire was so intense the soil is likely scorched, tree roots burned. It will take longer to recover and probably with a different mix of species, Macdonald said.Despite rains the fire will likely smoulder and have hotspots for months mainly because of the thick peat. In the fall when it usually gets drier, it could flare up into another fire, she said. At a rough estimate, the fire will have resulted in a few million tonnes of CO2 emitted. That compares to Alberta＊s 274m tonnes in 2014 〞 the majority of which is from the province＊s energy sector. CO2 emissions from the fire are not expected to be significant on a global scale ※unless a lot of peat burned,§ said Dr Mike Flannigan, professor of renewable resources at the University of Alberta. ※We will have some rough estimates in a week or two,§ Flannigan told the Guardian.There is little doubt the fire would have mobilised contaminants, with mercury, other heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) deposited on trees and soils, making the smoke potentially more toxic than a normal forest fire. Even worse were the toxins released by burning the 2,400 buildings and their contents. There＊s a lot of stuff like housing shingles, cars, couches and so on that produce a wide range of toxins including mercury, lead and organic compounds, said , a retired aquatic scientist formerly at the University of Alberta.People in Fort McMurray at the height of the fire were likely ※breathing lungfuls of toxins,§ Schindler told the Guardian.The smoke from the fires has travelled across the US to the Gulf coast, 3,400 km away. Fires are a known hazard mainly because small particles can damage lungs. However little is known how the release of contaminants in fires might play into human health impacts, said Dr Merritt Turetsky of the University of Guelph.Those toxins are now in the ash. The first good rain will result in a massive ※toxic surge§ into waterways including the Athabasca river that runs through the middle of Fort McMurray, said Schindler.There are already a lot of contaminants from oil sands production in the Athabasca river and sediments and the runoff from the fire will only make this worse, said Kevin Timoney, an ecologist at Treeline Ecological Research. While a heavy rain is the only way to extinguish the fire, that would be bad for the river.※It＊s very hard to know what the impacts will be on fish and other aquatic organisms,§ Timoney said.Alberta officials say they will be taking water samples in the region to measure any changes. Toxic ash and mountains of waste pose another environmental challenge in Fort McMurray. Some of this should be remediated and not just dumped in landfills, said Timoney.The scale is daunting. In 2011 a similar forest fire destroyed 400 buildings in the town of Slave Lake, Alberta. Ash clogged water treatment and sewer systems. Without electricity for two weeks, more than  had to be disposed of, along with debris cleaned from the streets, and waste from homes, buildings and yards, including fire-damaged concrete from foundations and walkways, vehicles, swing sets and more."																																																			
"Scientists in Britain have raised concerns about Australia＊s  to eradicate carp, saying it poses a serious risk to global food security, could cause ※catastrophic ecosystem crashes§ in Australia, and is unlikely to control carp numbers long term.In a letter published in the Nature Ecology and Evolution journal this week, University of East Anglia researchers Dr Jackie Lighten and Prof Cock van Oosterhout say the ※irreversible high-risk proposal§ could have ※serious ecological, environmental, and economic ramifications.§ The Australian government allocated $15m in the 2016 budget to a national carp control plan, centred around a plan to release the koi herpes virus into the  to kill common carp, or Cyprinus carpio.It followed , which conducted seven years of tests to ensure that native fish, birds, amphibians, and other species in the river system could not contract the virus.Lighten and van Oosterhout say the use of the carp herpes virus should not be compared to the release of the myxomatosis virus to control the rabbit population, arguing: ※compared with the biocontrol of terrestrial vertebrates, the biocontrol of large, highly fecund aquatic animals such as carp adds novel risks.§They argue that laboratory tests ※cannot rule out the possibility of cross-infection§ and that the virus will have ※an enormous evolutionary potential§ once released in the wild, and could evolve to attack other species.They also say that releasing a notifiable disease that attacks the most commonly-farmed fish in the world could impact the global food supply, and that the oxygen loss caused by millions of tonnes of rotting carp killed by the virus in the Murray Darling Basin could ※lead to catastrophic ecosystem crashes§.※[Koi herpes virus] is a highly efficient killer of common carp, and since its initial outbreak and rapid global spread in the 1990s it has caused millions of dollars of losses to the carp aquaculture and angling industries,§ van Oosterhout said. ※Carp is one of the most farmed fish in the world and an important source of protein in lower to middle income countries, so is vital to food security.§The coordinator of the National Carp Control Plan, Matt Barwick, said the concerns raised by Lighten and van Oosterhout were already being examined by the Fisheries Research Development Corporation.Barwick, who has been dubbed ※The Carpinator§ by the agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, and is an enthusiastic supporter of the project, has been given two years to develop the carp control plan and provide a detailed risk assessment to the federal government.That process will include further testing to ensure the virus does not affect other species, and Barwick said there was no evidence from countries where the virus was already present that it had evolved to attack other species.※This virus is now found in almost every river and lake system in Japan, and in another 32 countries,§ he told Guardian Australia.※Despite that, the only species that this virus has been detected to cause disease in is the common carp. In these countries they are sharing a waterway with other species of koi, very closely related to the common carp, and those other species haven＊t contracted the virus.Barwick said he did not believe it would threaten global food security, because all the countries that relied on carp as an aquaculture species already had the virus. Dealing with mass carp deaths after the virus＊s release was a significant problem, he said.Carp was introduced to Australia in the 1800s and makes up 90% of the fish biomass in the river system, to the devastation of native fish species and the general health of the waterways.It is not farmed for food purposes in Australia and cannot be traded with other countries, due to Australia＊s tough biosecurity laws. There is some commercial farming of ornamental koi, which are the same species as the common carp and are therefore susceptible to the virus. Latrobe University senior ecology lecturer Dr Susan Lawler, who is based on the Murray River, said Lighten and van Oosterhout ※don＊t understand the Australian perspective§.※The reason they are terrified of it going wrong is because they don＊t understand how terrified we are that all the native fish in Australia are going to die off because of carp,§ Lawler said. ※There＊s an ecological disaster going on right now.§Lawler said all of the concerns raised in the article, including that the virus could evolve to attack other fish, or that fish could die off in a eutrophic event caused by millions of dead carp, presupposed that native fish were not already dying. ※I am not worried about it because at the moment these fish are dying anyway.§ She agreed that the virus would not kill the entire carp population, and that their numbers would recover, but said that did not mean it wouldn＊t be a long-term solution. ※In my mind, 90% carp biomass reduced to 50% would be a long-term solution.Modelling done by the national carp research project anticipated the carp population would recover to between 30% and 40% of its current numbers after suffering the first mass mortality from the virus. Barwick said secondary control measures would be introduced to keep numbers down. "																																																			
" is likely to worsen existing inequalities in the US, with the poorest areas of the country poised to lose as much as 20% of their income by the end of the century if greenhouse gases are not significantly reduced.By 2100, the economic loss from warming temperatures will be on a par with the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, with states in the south and lower mid-west to be most severely affected, according to new research. Overall, each 1C of temperature rise is forecast to cost the US economy 1.2% in lost GDP, on average.※Unmitigated climate change will be very expensive for huge regions of the United States,§ said Soloman Hsiang of the University of California, Berkeley, one of the authors of the study.※If we continue on the current path, our analysis indicates it may result in the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in the country＊s history.§ While large areas of the south will suffer economically and socially from heatwaves, storms and failing crops, parts of New England and the Pacific north-west will do comparatively well, with balmier conditions reducing deaths from the winter cold and some crops responding well to the extra warmth.Previous research has shown that in some areas of the US, people have experienced seemingly favorable alterations to the climate. But the new study, , warns that unchecked climate change will prove costly for the whole country.※We are finely balanced at the moment but even areas that will do well end up being harmed if the world warms more severely,§ said Robert Kopp, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Rutgers University and another co-author. ※That borderline of net harm marches northwards over the course of the century.§※Climate change will be an amplifying factor in pre-existing economic inequalities. The warmest parts of the country are also the poorest parts of the country.Scientists looked at 116 climate projections and ran thousands of simulations of what would happen to the American economy under different emissions scenarios. Should little be done to constrain heat-trapping gases, temperatures could increase by up to 10F (5C) by the end of the century.By analyzing the impacts on agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy use, climate-related deaths and disrupted working conditions, the researchers found that the poorest third of counties in the US are set to experience an income loss of between 2% and 20% in this worst case scenario.As temperatures rise, some crops do well and cold-related deaths can drop off. But any increase in warmth is linked to rising seas and an increase in violent crime, with many aspects of life becoming hard or even unbearable as the temperatures climb further.Heatwaves , while the output of workers drops as it gets hotter. Energy use for cooling will grow as temperatures rise, while storms and the advancing seas will take their toll on coastal communities. States such as Texas, Louisiana and Georgia are expected to fare particularly badly. But Florida could be worst off of all given its low elevation and vulnerable demographics, Kopp said.※Florida is home to a lot of the hardest-hit counties,§ he said. ※It＊s hot, there are plenty of older people there and they will have a lot of coastal flooding and storms. You end up with Florida being the epicenter of these impacts.§The economic cost of climate change will gather pace as temperatures climb, the study found, with an average 0.6% GDP loss from the first 1C of temperature rise compared to 1.7% of GDP lost once the fifth degree of warming is experienced. Curtailing emissions from power plants, vehicles and agriculture will lessen some of these impacts, however. The research forecasts an average of one death per 100,000 people from climate-related impacts by the end of the century if emissions are radically cut, compared to a toll 10 times higher under ※business as usual§ conditions.Donald Trump hasn＊t acknowledged an economic cost to climate change and has instead pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement and started dismantling various environmental regulations with the stated goal of boosting growth. In his  announcing the US departure from the Paris accord, Trump said measures to reduce emissions would leave ※millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness§.This position has been increasingly challenged by researchers who have found that the cost of addressing climate change will probably be dwarfed by the consequences of rising seas, storms, drought and other maladies. In 2006, the economist Nicholas Stern  for the UK government that warned that at least 5% of global GDP could be lost each year due to climate change. Meanwhile, the US Environmental Protection Agency has  the US faces up to $180bn in economic losses by the end of the century due to drought and water shortages, and  from Stanford and Berkeley researchers found that most countries suffer economic losses once average temperatures move beyond 55F."																																																			
"The findings in your article (, 4 April) are scandalous. We are storing up huge unknowns in terms of the future of our children＊s lung health. We need urgent action. The government must bring in a fair and ambitious Clean Air Act with targets to ensure pollution levels are monitored around every school and nursery located close to busy roads, arming parents and teachers with the information they need to take action to protect children＊s health. Traffic emissions are the main culprit, but we know people bought their old diesel cars in good faith. A targeted scrappage incentive scheme would be a positive step, which could persuade drivers to switch quickly to cleaner vehicles. The Guardian and Greenpeace＊s investigation shows our children＊s lung health demands action now. Your article highlights diesel fumes in London.In Hampstead, north-west , pleas to Camden council to take account of the EU air quality directive and limit developments with massive lorry movements have not been heard. The council accepts that if it complied with the directive it will have to stop developments, and it is just not going to do that. Some 12,500 children go to schools in Hampstead every day, many under the age of seven. Development after development is approved by Camden and government planning inspectors right next to schools where children are exposed to lorry diesel fumes. One such development will see 2,000 lorry movements.Cycle superhighway 11 will shut five out of 10 lanes on the main north-south corridor used by 40,000 vehicles a day. Transport for London confirmed that traffic will fan out into our narrow residential streets causing congestion and pollution, with up to an extra 475 vehicles an hour on one of our roads which has two primary schools with kids aged from two. Parliament passed laws to enable HS2 to pollute our area with 800 lorry movements a day. The continuing assault on air quality by local councils and government authorities shows that they pay only lip?service to improving our air quality.   should be especially concerned as air pollution has been shown to cause a range of adverse effects including obesity, asthma, infant mortality, low birthweight babies, and depressed IQ.All schools keep a record of asthma inhalers brought to school and over two decades ago, the late Dr Dick van Steenis proposed that ※every county conduct a survey of primary schools to ascertain the proportion of children taking inhalers to school, and that any area with high proportions be investigated locally. This would be quick, cheap and effective.§ (Airborne pollutants and acute health effects, The Lancet, 8 April 1995).As far as I know, no council bothered to do so. Perhaps this will change now that  is mayor of London and an asthma sufferer who＊s determined to tackle air pollution, but who seems to have overlooked the impact of incinerator emissions. Will Khan publish the percentages of children in Years 3 to 6 in each London school who bring in asthma inhalers?"																																																			
"His character Jon Snow may fret about the arrival of winter, but  actor Kit Harington has said he was instead confronted by ※terrifying§ evidence of global warming while filming the HBO show.Harington said it was a ※very sad irony§ to film in locations with diminishing ice for scenes where the arrival of winter, and the frosty undead from beyond the Wall, is feared by his character.※We went to Iceland to find snow, because winter is here,§ the actor told . ※We got there and we were lucky to get the snow we did, because in our world, winter is definitely not here. It＊s this weird parallel, the opposite parallel. ※We go out there this year, and the glacier that me and Rose [Leslie, who played his love interest Ygritte] filmed on four years ago, I saw it and it has shrunk. I saw climate change and global warming with my own eyes, and it is terrifying.§Game of Thrones has used several locations in Iceland as backdrop to scenes from beyond the Wall 每 a frigid, snow-blanketed environment where the itinerant Wildings are threatened by the advance of the undead White Walkers. Grjotagja, a cave near the town of Akureyri, is where Snow and Ygritte sleep together, while the Sv赤nafellsj?kull and Vatnaj?kull glaciers are also featured. Vatnaj?kull, Europe＊s largest glacier, is  to be shrinking at a rate of 1 meter (3ft) a year and will probably disappear, along with Iceland＊s other glaciers, within 100 years, a government committee has warned. This rate of decline is shared by many of the world＊s largest ice sheets, with warming temperatures causing them to melt away and ultimately fuel sea level rise.Game of Thrones also films on location in countries such as Northern Ireland, Spain and Croatia. Harington said the show, despite the misery endured by many characters, is increasingly a pleasant distraction from recent real-world events.※There is a lot of chaos in the world right now, whether it＊s implemented by our government, purposeful chaos or not,§ he said. ※It＊s interesting being in a TV show that is not reflecting the world, but at the same time is.※Now, Westeros maybe feels like a nice escapism compared to what you＊re seeing on the news, because the world＊s politics has gotten very, very dark in recent weeks and months.§The  starts in July."																																																			
"It is a fact that  has its fair share of honey-tongued politicians but parliament is about to produce its very own product. in the grounds around Australia＊s Parliament House in Canberra to produce honey for sale in the shop and to give as gifts for visiting dignitaries. The project is the work of Cormac Farrell, an environmental scientist with engineering company Aurecon, in conjunction with the Australian National University＊s Apiculture Society and the Department of Parliamentary Services.Farrell had the hives in Aurecon＊s office space in Canberra but when they moved offices to a premises less suitable for bees, the hives had to find a new home. He said the bees range 5km from the hives so the parliamentary triangle is ideal because Canberra＊s centre is relatively free from pollution and has a good range of plants.※The parliament＊s landscaping crew have been brilliant to deal with,§ he said. ※They maintain the gardens almost completely pesticide free and there are eucalypts, with an understory of tea tree, there is cherry blossom in spring and a big stand of argyle apple nearby.§Farrell said a former MP William Yates, who served in both the British parliament and the Australian parliament, kept bees for a time in the Old Parliament House during the 1970s. Yates tricked the then speaker Billy Snedden by asking for permission to keep bees on April Fools Day. Snedden thought it was a joke and agreed. But today＊s hives will house the latest in bee technology, fitted with sensors to monitor the health of hives as well as the Australian-invented , to allow easy harvest of honey. Farrell is passionate about his bees and is also working with so-called sentinel bee hives at Canberra airport. The bees act as a first response team to detect pests and diseases, which can be picked up immediately in the hives. He says while it might seem weird to some to keep backyard bees in parliament, for his grandparents＊ generation it was normal. ※Bees help people understand how seemingly small things connect through to big things,§ he said.※Our cities are not concrete jungles, we can still have plants and we can produce food, bring some culture and real life to the place.§ "																																																			
"Conniving car makers and their lobbying might, assisted by the 2008 financial crash, were the key factors in producing the diesel-fuelled air pollution crisis the UK is struggling with today, according to key observers of the disaster.Earlier government decisions to incentivise diesel vehicles, which produce less climate-warming carbon dioxide, sparked the problem but were made in good faith. The heart of the disaster is instead a giant broken promise: the motor industry said it would clean up diesel but instead cheated and dodged the rules for years. The result has been that the air people breathe in cities and towns is now heavily polluted with toxic nitrogen dioxide, causing 23,500 premature deaths a year in the UK and affecting many schools. The government, whose inadequate plans have twice been declared illegal, will come up with a new, court-ordered strategy as soon as next week.※We were told by the vehicle manufacturers the [diesel emissions] limits would be met and there was no problem,§ said Greg Archer, who was managing the UK government＊s air pollution research two decades ago, when new tax breaks led to the diesel boom. ※What of course actually happened was those limits were not met on the road, as the car manufacturers started to turn down the after-treatment systems and cheat the tests.§The government＊s chief scientific adviser at the time, Sir : ※I was convinced the [motor manufacturers] could manage the problem. It turns out we were wrong.§The  has set increasingly tough emissions standards for NO2 since 2000, which would have kept levels down. But rather than deliver cars that met these limits in everyday driving, manufacturers created vehicles that passed the tests, conducted in standard conditions on rollers, but emitted pollutants at higher levels once out of the test centre.This sharp practice was motivated by the opportunity to shave costs or avoid the inconvenience of drivers needing to top up pollution-busting chemicals more than once a year. It has led to the bizarre situation where  than heavy trucks and buses, as the latter have always faced strict tests.By the mid-2000s, however, it was clear to air pollution experts that something was very wrong. NO2 levels were rising in cities, not falling, and on-the-road testing was starting to show that diesel vehicles were belching out vastly more pollution than they were supposed to.In 2005, the European commission decided real-world tests were needed to close the loopholes the car makers were exploiting and aimed to put these into force in 2009. But then came the financial crash and falling car sales, leading to ever more intense lobbying against tighter rules from the motor industry. A ※regulatory holiday§ ensued, according to Archer. The tougher tests will finally begin in September, eight years late and only because of the VW ※dieselgate§ scandal, in which the German motor giant was caught red-handed by US 每 not EU 每 regulators. The , approved this week, is stark on the cause of these ※excessive§ delays: the ※choices of political priorities [by national governments], lobby influence and constant pressure from the industry that directed the focus ... to avoiding burdens on industry in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis§.A glimpse of the backroom dealing done by national governments to protect their powerful car makers from greener regulations 每 whether NO2 or CO2 每 was revealed in 2013. , which the UK opposed, in return for British support in sidelining the stricter car regulations: all were duly kicked into the long grass.While VW were caught in outright cheating, virtually all manufacturers have systematically circumvented the intended pollution limits. ※There is strong evidence that vehicle manufacturers have employed a wide range of practices that are, in effect, defeat devices by another name,§ , chair of the UK parliament＊s transport committee, in 2016.The realisation that NO2 emissions are out of control has coincided with the growing realisation of their toxicity: earlier research had concentrated only on the particle pollution from exhausts. ※We have now reached a point where we have reached a high level of NO2 and we have now got health evidence against NO2 每 it＊s perfect storm,§ said Prof Frank Kelly, an eminent air pollution expert at Kings College London.Motor manufacturers were well aware their vehicles were highly polluting on the road, Kelly said: ※The car industry knew that, and they still know that. The car industry really has got a major role in this debacle.§ Even after the VW dieselgate scandal, the vast majority of new .Steve Gooding, director of the motoring group, the RAC Foundation, said: ※The real-world emissions performance of many vehicles has turned out to be a far cry from the hoped-for improvements the standards were intended to deliver. Going forward we need a testing regime we can all trust and cars that meet or preferably exceed the required standard.§The new, more realistic tests will help, but with each nation responsible for approving the cars that its domestic companies produce, the tendency for leniency could continue. The European parliament＊s proposal for an independent, EU-level regulator was rejected this week by centre-right MEPs, including those from the UK＊s Conservative party.※Car manufacturers have consistently failed to hit air pollution limits for diesel cars 每 it is about time prime minister Theresa May put the interests of people＊s health above the interests of the car industry,§ said Anna Heslop, of the environmental law firm ClientEarth, which has  at the high court. ※With the government＊s new air quality plans due before 24 April, she has the chance to prove that she can do this,§ said Heslop. ※Successive governments have got it wrong over diesel and the current government has had seven years to put it right and has done nothing to address the problem.§ClientEarth and others say the  it sold in the UK to emit less NO2, as has happened in Germany and France. The car industry now welcomes the new testing regime it previously lobbied against. ※It is well known that the existing emissions test is outdated, and industry welcomes a new, more robust regime coming this September,§ said Tamzen Isacsson, at the SMMT trade body. ※This will see cars tested on the road for the first time, meaning that the UK will be part of the toughest emissions standards in the world.§Isacsson also noted: ※Industry has invested billions into reducing emissions and has drastically reduced or banished pollutants such as particulates, sulphur and carbon monoxide, while the [latest] diesels are delivering vastly lower NO2 emissions.§ Archer remains unconvinced: ※The car industry continues to be as obstructive as they have always been. Nothing has changed.§But he has seen the start of change at the very top of the motor companies, he said: ※When I talk to people on the boards of the companies, many now see there is a huge change underway, to electric, connected, digital cars and that that transformation is coming very fast.§ With  in value, green car sales rising fast and , it may be the replacement of diesels, not cleaning them up, that finally clears the air."																																																			
"The government must reverse its opposition to new building regulations that ensure homes, hospitals and schools do not overheat as the number of deadly heatwaves rises, according to its official climate change advisers.The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommended the new regulations in 2015 but ministers rejected the advice, citing a commitment to ※reduce net regulation on homebuilders§. Without action, the number of people dying as a result of heat is expected to more than triple to 7,000 a year by 2040, the CCC warns in its annual report on the UK＊s progress on tackling global warming.Earlier in June, Britain experienced its longest period with  since 1976.  in the UK and the number of hot days is rising. On the hottest day of the year in 2016 there were almost 400 extra deaths, while a heatwave in 2006 led to 680 people dying and another in 2003 contributed to the deaths of about 2,000 people. ※What we need from government is a willingness to accept that building regulations, properly done, are not an incubus [problem] 每 they are in fact an opportunity to enable people to build for the future,§ said Lord Deben, chair of the CCC and a former Conservative environment secretary.※It is absolutely essential to recognise that we will not deal with the  unless we have tougher building regulations,§ he said. ※The government has a real opportunity to do that as it is going to have to look at its  [of the Grenfell Tower fire] and I think it is very important that they should take the opportunity to look at them in this wider sense.§The CCC＊s head of adaptation, Daniel Johns, said: ※We said [in 2015] there is a compelling case for a new building standard to avoid new homes overheating. But [the government] response said there was clearly a trade-off here and they were also mindful of . So this is an area where they consider the potential small additional cost that could be borne by developers and what that might mean for the price of houses, being traded off against the potential long term cost for people occupying these properties in the hotter summers and heatwaves in years to come.§The CCC identifies  to heat, as the UK＊s ageing population suffers most in hot temperatures, as well as schools and prisons. The best solutions for keeping buildings cool involve good ventilation at night and shading of windows during the day, said Johns. Air conditioning should not be the first choice, said Deben: ※If buildings are properly built in this country there is very little need for air conditioning. The problem with air conditioning is that it heats the area round about, so it has a disadvantage for the community as a whole. It＊s a constant pushing out of hot air.§Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive at the UK Green Building Council, said: ※The issue of overheating in buildings is of increasing concern. Clearly, there is a risk that our building regulations are no longer fit for purpose without robust protections against overheating.§The CCC＊s annual progress report says that the UK has done well in tackling climate change, cutting emissions by 42% since 1990 while GDP has risen by 65%. But it warns that the transition to a resilient, low carbon economy is in danger of being ※derailed§ by delays in important policies caused by the Brexit referendum and recent general election.※The events of the past year have been, by almost any measure, exceptional,§ said Deben. ※However, it is now time for government, and for parliament, to act.  is happening, not waiting. It is neither justifiable nor wise to delay further.§The UK is on track to miss its legally binding targets for cuts in carbon emissions and the plan to address this, expected in late 2016, will not now be published until autumn 2017. Emissions from energy have fallen, although key policies promoting this end in 2020. But emissions from transport and heating are rising and need to be urgently addressed, the CCC said.Furthermore, the overall state of the UK＊s natural environment is worsening, reducing its ability to withstand climate change. The government target is for 50% of land habitats to be in good condition by 2020, but only 25% currently are, crucial  and the government has repeatedly missed targets to plant 5,000 hectares of woodland a year.Progress to tackle river and coastal flooding has been made, the CCC says, but the widespread  has not been adequately addressed.A government spokesman said: ※The government is a world leader in tackling climate change and committed to meeting the UK＊s targets. Our industrial strategy continues to support our burgeoning low carbon sector which is helping deliver high-skilled jobs across the country.§※We＊ve implemented the majority of recommendations from the first National Adaptation Programme report.§ he said. ※But we agree there is a need to do more.§"																																																			
"n 2014, the World Health Organisation dubbed air pollution the ※single largest environment and human health threat§. With particulate matter and toxic pollutants accounting for  annually, many cities around the globe are gasping for solutions. Engineer Anirudh Sharma has come up with a creative approach. While walking in Mumbai in 2013, the MIT Media Lab student and ※chronic inventor§ noticed that the plumes of diesel exhaust emitted by buses and cars were staining his clothing black. ※I thought: what if we could cleverly recycle all this soot that is making the world dirty, and use the pigment to make something beautiful, like ink?§ Sharma says. He formed a startup called  and has spent the past three years developing an exhaust filter that can capture 95% of the carbon soot from cars, generators and ferries and turn it into ink and paint. The result is , the world＊s first line of art supplies made from air pollution. Following a successful  campaign last month, the startup＊s oil-based paints, markers and spray cans are set to ship in June. Sharma is now travelling to smog-choked cities around the world and challenging 19 street artists to create billboards and murals illustrating the effects of carbon waste, starting in London. Last month, an installation dubbed ※the world＊s first clean air gallery§ appeared in Windrush Square in Brixton, south London, which recently made headlines by surpassing its air pollution limit for the entire year in only . The pop-up featured works by artists from five of the UK＊s most polluted cities (London, Glasgow, Leeds, Southampton and Nottingham) and used Air-Ink products made from exhaust collected over a five-day period. A separate hand-drawn billboard by artist  showing fumes billowing into iconic London landmarks emerged over Shaftesbury Avenue last Monday, and will hang near Piccadilly Circus until 10 April. Other Air-Ink exhibitions and installations are scheduled to follow in Berlin, Singapore and New York until the end of April.  The raw material for Air-Ink is collected through a patented cylindrical device called a  that fits on to a vehicle＊s tail pipe and traps unburned carbon before it is expelled into the air, capturing soot particles as small as 2.5 micrometers across, or a 30th of the diameter of a human hair. Sharma and his team then remove impurities such as metals and carcinogens, grind the purified soot into ink pigment, and mix it with vegetable oil to create bold inks, markers and paints that have Kaalink＊s early adopters buzzing.As part of initial testing for the product, Sharma installed five Kaalinks on Tiger beer delivery trucks in  recently.※We＊re taking something from the street and putting it back into the street in an inspiring and sustainable way,§ Ho said. ※I went through about 10 to 15 markers on this mural, and when I was running low, the [Tiger beer lorries] just went out into central London to collect more ink. ※I don＊t know if it＊s the pollution, but the quality of the ink is really special,§ Ho added. ※It＊s pitch black, really thick and dries incredibly quickly. I have some left over and plan on using it again on my other projects.§ The jet-black ink is also remarkably green. Each 30-millilitre pen contains between 40-50 minutes of Kaalink-captured air pollution, while each six-litre spray can holds 2,000 minutes of diesel exhaust. In the past year, Sharma says that his team has cleaned nearly 1.7 trillion litres of air in Hong Kong and throughout India, where  is based, to harvest 770 litres of ink 每 the equivalent in terms of particulate emissions of continuously driving a standard diesel saloon car for 2.3 years.Considering that the company has only distributed about 75 exhaust filters to friends and family thus far, it＊s an impressive start. Yet Sharma knows that he needs to make the company bigger if he wants a wider pilot scheme 每 such as strapping the steel Kaalink cylinders to taxis, buses or factory chimneys.  ※There＊s a massive potential here,§ he said. ※If each of the 20,000 black cabs in London had our product, we could clean 30 trillion litres of air a year§ And if it leads to more art, even better."																																																			
"n a good morning, from my Beijing tower block, I could gaze across the city to the hills far to the west. On the worst days, when pollution levels , I could barely make out the buildings across the road. The air purifiers in each room were turned up to 11. The filters inside were supposed to last for six months 每 but after just a couple of months, the pristine white folds had usually turned charcoal grey.Even with a mask, 20 minutes outside could leave you feeling nauseous. Friends complained of sore throats and coughs that never went away. It was a running, though unamusing, joke: Airmageddon. The airpocalypse. Beige-jing. But it got inside your head as well as your system. After a spate of especially bad days, my spirits lowered. I longed to see the sky.And then one spring I returned home for a holiday, and turned the corner at the , one of the loveliest I know. Below me lay the Hope Valley, and, to my horror, the smog lay thick in its bottom. It took me a moment to recognise my error. Pollution had become so normal to me that, even at a place I knew so well, and had seen shrouded so often, it had not occurred to me that it was just mist.In primary school my teacher had described climbing up to the hills as a child, and being unable to see Sheffield thanks to the blanket of smog. So many years , it had been unimaginable to us. Now I took toxic air as the norm, like so many in China. I rolled my eyes when headlines shouted about the . It was, by Beijing＊s standards, a pretty clear day.Now I live in London again and note each morning how good it feels to breathe clean air. But I＊ve noticed, too, how unpleasant it can be to walk along Euston Road. And I＊ve started to ask myself why I＊ve regarded illegal levels of pollution as acceptable. It is hard to see how our own attitudes 每 what we notice, what we tolerate 每 shift and how dependent this is on the views of people around us. To begin with, I took Beijing＊s bad days for granted. I lived there for five years before getting purifiers. No one liked the filthy air: but most residents regarded it as inevitable, like bad weather. Masks were seen as at best an eccentricity, at worst an indulgent affectation. The only Chinese people who wore them were warding off infections or trying not to spread them.It＊s hard to pinpoint exactly when things changed. The research was piling up 每 scary data on the : early deaths, heart and lung problems, cancer, diabetes, birth defects. So was the anecdotal evidence: toddlers who developed terrible asthma; the previously healthy friend who found himself waking in the night, struggling to breathe. Soon we were checking an air pollution app each morning, and discussing air purifiers and masks as petrolheads might compare sports cars. Private schools acquired inflatable domes so pupils could exercise without going outside.We could afford to do this. Whether in Birmingham, Beijing or Delhi, pollution disproportionately affects the poor. They are more likely to live in heavily polluted areas (near factories or main roads, say) and are by definition less able to afford even partial remedies. But no one can escape the problem entirely.Politburo members also looked out on a wall of grey, and presumably their sisters and sons were complaining, and their grandchildren too were racked by coughs. In 2015, hundreds of millions of people watched , which laid out the impact of pollution on China in frightening detail. It was a turning point in public awareness 每 and strikingly, while it was eventually censored, it had received at least partial official backing. Some within the leadership had realised that it had to take action, even if there is .That British problems are less severe does not mean we can afford to ignore them. The impact of nitrogen dioxide levels on our health, and especially that of our children, whose developing lungs are so much more vulnerable, . The high court has twice judged the government＊s response to air pollution .Measures such as masks and purifiers may help individuals and even save lives. But they are not enough. The true significance of their adoption in  was that they showed people were recognising the problem. Their popularity helped to reinforce the sense that such concerns were sensible and pressing rather than peculiar or trivial. The real solutions are social 每 taken by city leaders, national governments and international bodies. But they will act only when the rest of us decide we have had enough."																																																			
"A stretch of  off Mexico is the testing ground for a new idea that could protect fragile environments around the world: insurance.The reef, off the coast of Canc迆n, is the first to be protected under an insurance scheme by which the premiums will be paid by local hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.Coral reefs offer a valuable buffer against storm damage from waves but  in recent years, the result of human exploitation and destruction of the reefs, as well as climate change, plastic waste and the .Under the Canc迆n insurance policy, pioneered by the insurance company  and , a US environmental charity, local organisations dependent on tourism will pay in to a collective pot likely to amount to between $1m (?770,000) and $7.5m for the insurance premiums on the policy, and a 40 mile (60km) stretch of reef and connected beach will be monitored. If any destructive storms damage the reef system, the insurer will pay out sums likely to be $25m to $70m in any given year.Any payouts will be used for restoration of the reef, for instance by building artificial structures that can increase the height of the reef in case of storm damage.Corals from the reef can be removed and rested for a period of weeks or months, to help them regrow, at which point they can be safely reattached to their native habitat to regenerate the growth of the reef system. The advantages of such restoration go far beyond the hotels that border the seafront. As well as providing a natural brake against destructive storms, coral reefs provide nurseries for fish when they are growing, and form a vital part of the marine ecosystem. Their health or decline is seen as one of the key indicators of the state of the natural environment globally.The Canc迆n scheme, which is to be run by Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, with backing from the Mexican government, is thought to be one of the first in the world to tie environmental benefits and the provided by natural environmental features to firm monetary costs and rewards. It could provide a model for similar projects in the future, linking the protection and preservation of the environment to payouts in case of disaster.Hotels and private companies are signing up to the scheme at present, and the plan is for a fund backed by the government that will cover the premiums. This is scheduled to be activated in September, with further contracts to be signed in November and December, and full coverage will then begin from next January.※Public-private partnerships are the key,§ said Mark Tercek, chief executive of the Nature Conservancy, in an interview with the Guardian. He predicted that more governments would see the advantages of such an approach when the Canc迆n scheme begins formal operation.※I used to get very frustrated that not enough was happening [to protect the environment],§ said Tercek. ※We have to push business leaders to go further, to stick their neck out to tackle issues beyond the short term.§Tercek said the Canc迆n scheme would provide an example for businesses, governments and insurance firms that would be ※very scalable around the world§.A future target for similar insurance products could be , which also protect the shore against storm damage, and are equally under threat, with many destroyed to make way for housing development or farming, and others in peril from climate change."																																																			
"A son of Cecil the lion has been killed by trophy hunters in Zimbabwe, meeting the same fate as his father whose death in 2015 .Xanda was six years old and had fathered a number of cubs himself. He was shot on 7 July just outside the Hwange national park, not far from where Cecil died, but news of the death only became public on Thursday.The trophy hunt was organised by Zimbabwean private hunter Richard Cooke but his clients, who may have paid tens of thousands of dollars, have not been revealed. Xanda was wearing a GPS tracking collar, fitted by scientists led by Andrew Loveridge at Oxford University, who have studied the Hwange lions for many years.※Xanda was one of these gorgeous Kalahari lions, with a big mane, big body, beautiful condition 每 a very, very lovely animal,§ Loveridge told the Guardian. ※Personally, I think it is sad that anyone wants to shoot a lion, but there are people who will pay money to do that.§※I put the collar on Xanda last October and spent a bit of time following him around,§ he said. ※You have handled them so you feel a personal engagement with the animal.§ But Loveridge does not condemn trophy hunting outright: ※Trophy hunting protects an area about the size of France and Spain combined in . So if you throw trophy hunting out, what happens to all that habitat?§Xanda was the pride male in a group with two adult lionesses and cubs which roamed near the boundary of the national park. ※He was shot 2km from the park boundary, which is a hop and a skip for a lion,§ Loveridge said. The scientists want a 5km no-hunting zone around the park. ※It is something we have suggested for years,§ he said. ※But there is a lot of resistance because a lot of the hunting happens right on the boundary, because that is where the animals are. The photo-tourism operators in Hwange are very keen to have that discussion. They are annoyed that this has happened.§Xanda＊s death poses no immediate danger to the 550-strong lion population in Hwange national park, which spreads over 15,000 sq km, Loveridge said: ※The lion population is pretty healthy, but it would probably be better if it didn＊t happen,§ said Loveridge.The scientist said Cooke is a responsible operator and had a legal quota for the hunt: ※He is very ethical, he doesn＊t cut corners. He has always communicated with us when he has hunted an animal, and given us the collar back. He is not one of the fly-by-night guys.§ Cooke has killed several collared lions in the past, Loveridge said. Cooke did not respond to requests for comment.※I＊ve had a look at the GPS collar data and it all seems to be as [Cooke] says,§ Loveridge said. ※The collar goes to a hunting camp and this is when you know the animal has been shot.§The death of Cecil the lion in 2015, killed by US dentist Walter Palmer, led to widespread criticism of the trophy hunting of lions, which has become a big business with the number  in the last decade. Lions have lost 90% of their overall population in the last century and only about 20,000 remain.Philip Mansbridge, UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said: ※IFAW opposes the cruel and needless killing of wild animals for recreation and encourages enjoyment and appreciation of these magnificent animals within their natural habitats through sustainable ecotourism opportunities. This has proven to be more beneficial for communities living with wildlife.§※The unprecedented global outcry after  was killed just goes to show the vast majority oppose the actions of the minority that enjoy slaughtering these animals for trophies,§ he said. ※These animals deserve our protection, not bullets.§Masha Kalinina at the Humane Society International said: ※Trophy hunters have learned nothing. To stop lions slipping into extinction, it is critical that countries like  focus on keeping as many lions alive as possible. It could follow the examples of Botswana and Kenya, which ban trophy hunting.§Prof David Macdonald, another of the Oxford team, told the Guardian in December that  could provide valuable funds to protect lion habitats.※Of course I understand if people say there are simply no circumstances under which [trophy hunting] will be acceptable to me,§ he said. ※If so, then they have to look for a mechanism of replacing it with something that is acceptable. That might be people putting their money where their mouth is, buying out the hunting interest and replacing it with some sort of international payment for conservation.§Cecil, who was 13 when killed, was believed to have had 13 as of June 2016."																																																			
"The true scale of the slaughter of pangolins in  has been revealed by new research showing that millions of the scaly mammals are being hunted and killed.Pangolins were already known to be the world＊s most trafficked wild mammal, with at least a million being traded in the last decade to supply the demand for its meat and scales in Asian markets. Populations of Asian pangolins have been decimated, leaving the creatures highly endangered and sharply shifting the focus of exploitation to Africa＊s four species.Pangolins are secretive, nocturnal and some species live in trees, making them very hard to count and the total size of the populations in Africa is unknown. But the new analysis, based on data collected by hundreds of local researchers at scores of hunting sites and bushmeat markets across central and west Africa, found up to 2.7m are being killed every year, with the most conservative estimate being 400,000 a year. ※The number is definitely shocking,§ said Daniel Ingram, at the University of Sussex, UK, and who led the research team. ※Pangolins have been hunted out of many areas in Asia and recent analyses show there is a growing international trade between Africa and Asia. If we don＊t act now to better understand and protect these charismatic animals, we may lose them.§Pangolins curl up into a scaly ball when threatened, which defeats natural predators like lions but is no defence against human hunters. The researchers found half the animals had been snared or trapped, despite wire snares being illegal in most of the 14 central African nations analysed in the research.The analysis, , also found that almost half of the pangolins killed were juveniles, an indicator that the populations are being dangerously overexploited as animals are being caught before they can reproduce. This is particularly harmful as pangolins are slow breeding and produce only a single pup every year or two.The new estimates of pangolins killed are likely to be minimum numbers as they included only three of Africa＊s four pangolins, the giant, white-bellied and black-bellied species. The fourth, the cape pangolin, lives in southern and eastern Africa, outside the study area.Furthermore, it is illegal to kill giant pangolins in all the countries, meaning not all the illicit trade in the animals will be included in the estimates. The giant pangolins are particularly sought after and the researchers found the price demanded in urban markets has soared almost six times since the 1990s. They also found hunting of the African pangolins in 2014 was 150% higher than in the 1970s.Richard Thomas, from the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic, said very little had been known about pangolin populations in central and west Africa. He also pointed the ※remarkable regularity§ of major pangolin seizures. In June alone, , each representing many thousands of animals and originating from Africa.A  was passed by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species in September. But Ingram said the enforcement of both international and national laws had to be increased to prevent African pangolins following their Asian cousins on the path to extinction.The demand in Asia for pangolin meat and scales as delicacies and supposed medicinal uses is a major factor in cross-border trade but a significant proportion of African pangolins are eaten locally. Ingram said that measures are also needed to develop alternative livelihoods for African hunters of pangolin, but he believes there is still enough time left to act: ※I am optimistic that something can be done.§ "																																																			
"Two weeks ago, Senator Al Franken (D-MN) had an exchange with Trump＊s Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry about climate change. Perry＊s responses perfectly summarized the Republican Party＊s current position on the subject. The problem is that it＊s an indefensible position.The Republican position is based upon a rejection of established climate science. When confronted with the conclusion that global warming is 100% due to human activities, Perry responded, ※I don＊t believe that ... don＊t buy it.§ But of course it＊s not a matter of belief 每 that＊s what the scientific evidence indicates. There have been dozens of studies quantifying the various contributions to recent global warming. I summarized ten of them in the chart below (), and the answer is clear:That＊s why the latest IPCC report likewise included a best estimate that . During that time, , and there haven＊t been any significant natural warming factors. Perry talked about ※the warming and cooling of our ocean waters,§ but the  due to human-caused global warming.On this issue there＊s a 97% expert consensus whether you survey  or their  or their . And the greater the climate science expertise of those surveyed, . Many Republican policymakers will now admit, like Perry, that humans have ※some impact§ on the climate. That simply represents an acceptance of . They don＊t deserve much credit for finally accepting science that was first established when John Quincy Adams was president.There＊s a chance the less than 3% fringe minority of contrarian climate scientists are right. It＊s a slim chance, given that their research , is , and their , but it＊s not impossible. But that＊s like saying there＊s a chance that if I chain smoke cigarettes for 50 years I won＊t develop lung cancer. Or that I＊ll never get in a car accident, or that my home will never be broken into or catch fire. Those are all possibilities, but people generally don＊t like to take big risks with our health, or important purchases like cars and homes without having an insurance policy.With Earth＊s climate, there is no insurance policy. Either it remains stable and habitable or it becomes increasingly unstable and uninhabitable. In that sense the smoking analogy is quite apt. The more we smoke, the more we increase our chances of developing cancer. The more carbon pollution we dump into the atmosphere, the more we increase the odds of destabilizing Earth＊s climate. We can either take that risk, or we can cut down our smoking or carbon pollution to minimize it. As it stands, climate change may represent humans＊ , and climate inaction is decidedly anti-conservative.Currently, most Republican policymakers don＊t want to take any action to curb America＊s carbon pollution (with the exception of ). Like Rick Perry, they will often cite concerns about economic impacts to justify climate policy opposition. That＊s exactly backwards.In reality, climate inaction is the expensive route, and . That＊s the conclusion not of some tree-hugging environmental group, but . Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions published a report in 2015 finding that investment costs alone in a climate action scenario would be $2 trillion lower than in an inaction, fossil fuel investment scenario. In other words, even if the 97% consensus is wrong, investing as though it were correct would save money. And if the 97% consensus is right, Citi found that slowing global warming would save tens of trillions of dollars more.It＊s not just the Citibank report; there＊s a  that the US government should commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Only 1% of economists disagree. 41% of economists think climate change is already hurting the global economy, 63% think it will by 2025, 89% by 2050, and 97% by 2100.Sadly, today＊s wealthy policymakers won＊t feel the impacts of their climate policy obstruction. Today＊s youth, and  people in  who are  for the problem will most suffer the consequences.America is , one of the world＊s , and has joined Syria and Nicaragua as the only countries . Nicaragua objected that the agreement was . Essentially, Trump and the Republican Party stand alone in rejecting the need for climate action, despite the country＊s responsibility for the problem and resources available to address it. We＊re forcing the rest of the world to clean up our dangerous mess. It＊s a grossly immoral and unethical position.There＊s simply no way to defend the Republican Party＊s climate policy obstruction. The scientific evidence is clear, which is why there＊s a 97% expert consensus. It＊s possible (however unlikely) that those scientific experts are wrong, but risking the stability of the climate on which every living organism on Earth relies on such a long shot is a terrible failure of basic risk management. Moreover, doing so would badly hurt the economy. There are climate policies that , that have bipartisan support and have been . Every other world country agrees on the need for climate action, and yet most Republican Party leaders are unwilling to even engage in the climate policy debate.These are the reasons why . They will eventually pay the political price for this indefensible, immoral stance, much as they lost huge segments of the American electorate due to party positions on civil rights and gay marriage.

"Your editorial on the French elections (), with its encouraging mention of the rise of the higher tax and spend candidate Jean-Luc M谷lenchon, failed to mention possibly his biggest electoral draw: . Prior to the 2012 election, polls showed that over 80% of French across the political spectrum thought that free trade had a negative impact on employment. So it＊s not just immigration that is fuelling ever-broadening support for Marine Le Pen, it is also the fact that she too is an overt protectionist.These trends have obviously not been lost on the unholy trinity of free trade pushers the IMF, WTO, and the World Bank (, 11 April). Having forced nations across the world to accept their open-borders, export-led growth mantra they are now busy crying crocodile tears for the ※left behind§, the inevitable result of their policies. They still rail against protectionism, despite the fact that if it has a progressive end goal, it could enhance the economic and social conditions of the globally disadvantaged.In terms of the relevance of all this to the UK, and at the risk of intruding on public grief, what are the  party＊s views on these under-publicised protectionist trends? The likes of Trump and Le Pen have been able to turn it into a politically potent and successful issue, so why are so many progressives over here absent from this pivotal debate? The attempt by the , IMF and WTO to defend the role of ※free§ trade merely serves to underline their role as advocates of a neoliberal order that impoverishes the many and benefits the few. The call for a ※robust global trading system based on the WTO§ is aimed at locking in countries to a system that removes decision-making from sovereign states and places it instead in the boardrooms of transnational corporations. When their report states that trade is good for growth, what they really mean is that it is good for corporate balance sheets. And when they refer to helping those ※left behind§, they are inviting us to believe in discredited theories of trickle-down economics which holds that what is good for the rich is good for the poor.As we move into the uncertainties of a new post-Brexit trading regime, it is incumbent upon us to develop alternative models to outdated concepts that automatically equate GDP growth with increased wellbeing. And it＊s also time to not only challenge the WTO＊s direction of travel but also to recognise it for what it is and campaign for its abolition, replacing it instead with a consensual model of economic integration based on the needs and aspirations of independent states and their regional priorities. As  preaches protectionism, he would do well to heed his far wiser predecessor, Thomas Jefferson, when he said: ※Peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations ＃ entangling alliances with none.§ We must not lose sight of the downsides to globalisation and world trade. The rampant consumerism which is driving economic growth is certainly lifting incomes for some while also lining the pockets of global corporations. But only recently (, 10 April) you reported that our consumption of Chinese products causes about 55,000 early deaths from air pollution across China every year. While the three organisations say that they want to pay attention to disadvantaged individuals and communities, they will not be able to ※lift up those who have been left behind§ if they are dead. ※We worked together to ensure that the great recession did not become another great depression§, says  of the IMF. The truth is quite the opposite 每 they and their supporters in the US, the World Bank and the WTO, brought about the crash in 2008 with their insistence on deregulation of the finance business. The aftermath of 2008 is still penalising the poor and what used to be the better-off, both in the rich and poor worlds. Doughnut economics is very compelling, but George Monbiot (, 12 April) and, presumably, Kate Raworth, seem not to have encountered A Blueprint for Survival. This remarkable document was published by the Club of Rome, with spadework by MIT, in 1969. It postulated that pollution would end matters if the world proceeded on its continual pursuit of economic growth. That hasn＊t happened, but not for our want of trying. But the important message was how to create a no-growth, vibrant successful economy by pouring all the world＊s efforts into recycling, making things that lasted as long as possible and general encouragement of invention centred on conservation of resources and environment.I and my colleagues teaching general studies in FE spent some enlightening weeks with our students exploring the validity of the proposals. I also wrote to my MP asking what the government＊s attitude was; I got a nondescript reply. And that＊s where matters shuddered to a permanent halt. I do hope Kate Raworth has better luck for all our sakes."																																																			
"onald Trump＊s decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal may have followed months of anguished division amongst his closest advisers, but his administration has proceeded with quiet efficiency in its dismantling of other major environmental policies.The White House, Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency have dovetailed to engineer a dizzying reversal of clean air and water regulations implemented by Barack Obama＊s administration.Unlike the travel ban or healthcare, Trump has faced few obstacles in sweeping away what he has called ※job-killing§ environmental rules that address problems such as climate change, water pollution and smoggy air. ※I＊ve been very concerned by what I＊ve seen 每 this is about people＊s health,§ said Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who was the EPA administrator under George W Bush, and also served as governor of New Jersey. ※They are undermining science and people＊s respect for science. They don＊t seem to care.§Trump＊s agenda has been enthusiastically spearheaded by Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the EPA, who promised in February that he would be rolling back regulations ※in a very aggressive way§. Pruitt has repeatedly decried the economic cost of green strictures, especially on the coal industry, which he said was the target of a ※war§ from the Obama administration.Pruitt, who previously sued the EPA more than a dozen times as attorney general of Oklahoma, and has had unusually close ties to the fossil fuel industry, has helped withdraw or postpone a raft of regulations and has steered the EPA away from climate change work.While every new administration reviews or even reshapes inherited regulations 每 especially those enacted in the dying days of a prior presidency 每 the scale of the current rollback is unprecedented, according to Whitman.※We looked at 60 or 70 rules and we upheld them all, whereas this administration seems to think everything done in the last administration was bad,§ she said. ※This is the president＊s agenda. Scott Pruitt absolutely believes in that agenda, but this is coming from the president.§Pruitt has pointed to  每 ozone levels dropped 17% from 2000 to 2015, while sulfur dioxide fell 69% over the same period 每 as evidence that relentless technological improvements in cars and power plants will continue to reduce pollution.But many former EPA officials have warned against using these improvements as a reason to water down protections. The soon-to-be-rewritten clean power plan, for one, was forecast to prevent 3,600 premature deaths and 90,000 asthma attacks nationally once up and running.※These kind of actions will put a brake on the progress we＊ve seen,§ said Tom Burke, who was EPA science advisor in the Obama administration and is now director of risk sciences at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ※Having worked in fence-line communities and places with contaminated water, I don＊t think people there are saying ＆we are clean enough, let＊s roll things back.＊※There＊s a very obvious shift at the EPA to make it more business-friendly. Maybe that＊s not a bad thing for the business community, but I am very concerned this will impact the health of millions of people.※The EPA＊s mission is to protect public health and the environment, not to protect corporate earnings. It＊s very concerning to see.§ Trump signs a bill repealing an anti-corruption rule that required energy companies to disclose payments to foreign governments. The regulation was scrapped under the Congressional Review Act. The stream protection rule, which prevented mining companies dumping their waste into streams, is axed under the Congressional Review Act. Trump calls it a ※terrible job-killing rule.§ Trump instructs the EPA to rewrite the ＆waters of the United States＊ rule, which expanded the definition of the Clean Water Act to protect the water supply for around 117 million Americans. Many farmers, real estate developers and golf course owners opposed the rule.  On 1 March, governors and attorneys general from several Republican-led states  to Scott Pruitt to request the EPA stop collecting methane emissions data from around 15,000 oil and gas operations. A day later, Pruitt says he has decided to oblige ※after hearing from industry§.  Trump announces a review of vehicle fuel efficiency standards that are designed to push down greenhouse gases and other pollutants. More than a dozen car company chief executives asked the president to revisit an Obama-era decision to mandate improved fuel economy by 2025. Pruitt calls the standards ※costly for automakers and the American people.§  A sweeping  orders a rewrite of the EPA＊s clean power plan, which was Obama＊s centerpiece climate policy, an end to the moratorium on coal mining on public land and the removal of climate change as a consideration when approving federal projects. Pruitt  to halt the use of chlorpyrifos, a widely-used pesticide. The chemical has been linked to damage to the nervous system and last year EPA scientists said a ban was warranted. Household use of the chemical was phased out a decade ago but it is still used in farms across the US.  A court grants an EPA request to delay the implementation of ozone pollution standards that were made stricter in 2015. The EPA intends to review the rules around ozone, which is created when sunlight reacts with pollutants from vehicles exhausts and other sources. Ozone can create smogs and can trigger a raft of health ailments, especially among children, the elderly and those with respiratory problems. The EPA pauses a regulation that curbs the dumping of toxic metals such as arsenic and mercury by power plants into public waterways. The Obama-era rule, set to commence in 2018, would＊ve destroyed jobs, according to Pruitt. The EPA  a US appeals court to halt a challenge by states and industry groups to an Obama administration rule aimed at reducing toxic emissions from power stations. Pruitt, in his previous role as attorney general of Oklahoma, had sued the EPA to stop the rule, which is known as MATS. A three-month pause is put on landfill methane rules so they EPA can ※reconsider certain aspects§ of the regulation. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and is emitted from rotting garbage in landfills, as well as other sources such as agriculture.  The EPA announces plans for a  that would reduce emissions leaks from oil and gas operators. The regulator acknowledges that pollution from the leaks results in ※disproportionate§ harm to children but proposes to go ahead with the suspension of the rule anyway. The EPA, along with the US army, . This would reverse an Obama-era move that expanded federal government protections to the drinking water of around a third of all Americans. Pruitt said the rollback will provide ※regulatory certainty to our nation＊s farmers and businesses.§ The announcement didn＊t reference public health.

" shopper at a supermarket asks for a plastic bag, only to have his head slammed into the checkout counter by the ※green police§ (※You picked the wrong day to mess with the ecosystem, plastic boy§). Another man attracts a spotlight from a green police helicopter for a ※compost infraction§ as he＊s about to bin an orange rind. The green police bust down doors after finding batteries in the trash. They haul people from their homes for installing incandescent lightbulbs.But to the driver who approaches a road checkpoint in his Audi, the green police react very differently. ※Clean diesel? You＊re good to go, sir.§ And they wave him through. It＊s hard to believe, as diesel vehicles find themselves thrust into the spotlight of a global urban environment crisis, that  was made just seven years ago. Air pollution now  每 more than HIV, malaria and influenza combined 每 with emissions from diesel engines among the worst culprits; a  by the Guardian and Greenpeace showed hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren across England and Wales are being exposed to illegal air toxicity levels from diesel vehicles. And yet such was the more or less widely accepted thinking as recently as Superbowl XLIV in 2010 每 namely, that cars running on diesel fuel could be driven with a pure, unclouded conscience.Diesel was touted at inception as a wonder fuel. It was a way of driving cost-efficiently while doing your bit to save the planet. Government, industry and science united to sell us the dream: cars running on diesel would help us cut our CO2 emissions as we eased smoothly into a new eco-friendly age.It was particularly owing to advances in engine technology that the diesel passenger car market was able to blossom in the 1990s, particularly in Europe. Drivers liked the fuel efficiency of diesel engines, which made running costs cheaper than petrol over the long term. Governments, meanwhile, alarmed by rising carbon emissions, began advising citizens to switch to diesels, which were thought to emit less CO2 than their petrol counterparts. Diesel＊s biggest moment in the UK was probably in 2001, when Gordon Brown, then chancellor of the Labour government,  as a deliberate effort to encourage people to switch.The cracks took a long time to appear, but when they did they splintered rapidly. In 2012 came the first major evidence of some truly dreadful health impacts. Nitrogen oxides and dioxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) pumped out by diesel exhausts were fingered as silent killers. The studies multiplied. The European Environment Agency found that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from diesel fumes had caused around  across the continent in a single year. It said the UK experienced 11,940 annual premature deaths from NO2, the second highest in Europe behind Italy. The World Health Organisation , a cause of lung cancer in the same category as asbestos and mustard gas. Then in 2015 came Dieselgate. In September of that year, Volkswagen, which vies with Toyota for top spot in the list of world＊s biggest car companies and a firm that had for years been running its own marketing campaign in favour of ※clean diesel§, rocked the industry by admitting that it had cheated on its emission tests. As recently as last week, David King, the UK government＊s former chief scientific adviser on climate change, admitted ministers had made a huge mistake by promoting diesel. They had trusted the car industry when it said the fuel was clean. ※It turns out we were wrong,§ he said.Cities worldwide have scrambled. The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City have agreed to completely outlaw diesel vehicles from the centre of their cities by 2025. The political leaders that make up the  of global megacities are all taking steps to crack down on diesel vehicles and reduce smog. But other cities, including British ones, are tinkering around the edges; London is proposing low-emission zones and toll charges, but has stopped short of a ban.So is this simply a period of bad PR, or has the backlash against diesel reached a tipping point? Has the one-time wonder fuel become the new asbestos 每 not to say mustard gas? And if this is really the beginning of the end for diesel, how much longer before the pariah is banished from the city for good? Banning diesel is trickier than it seems. The scale of the problem remains enormous. Diesel never made huge inroads into the US, where gasoline remained cheap, and where American automakers focused their innovation efforts on hybrid and electric vehicles. But in Europe, diesel passenger cars remain a major part of the auto industry: astonishingly, they still account for nearly  of all new cars sold across the continent.Meanwhile, a  of the latest diesel cars by the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) says real-world emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) are, on average, seven times higher than safety limits allow. A separate  showed that latest diesel cars produce 10 times the NOx of heavy trucks or buses, which are more strictly regulated than cars.The car manufacturers, too, have a hugely powerful lobby still at their disposal. According to Greg Archer, who once managed the UK government＊s air pollution research, automakers used their influence to ensure a  after the financial crash. They claimed that the Euro 5 and Euro 6 emissions standards, aimed at limiting pollutants from exhausts, led to significant reduction in pollutants. But a  of real-world performance shows those claims were bogus: Emissions Analytics found that 97% of the diesel cars made since 2011 exceed NOx safety limits.Governments were complicit, too. In one particularly egregious case,  to halt a proposed EU cap on bankers＊ bonuses 每 dreaded by the City of London 每 in return for British support to protect the German car industry and thwart a stricter emissions regime.Nor is it easy to persuade drivers to switch. Many motorists are understandably angry that they were encouraged to invest in diesel engines but are now expected to face clean air zones, pollution charges and other restrictions. Many feel that they are, in effect, being punished for what they were told was the smart, responsible choice. Mazyar Keshvari, an MP from Norway＊s right-wing Progress Party, calls Europe＊s anti-diesel pivot ※the biggest swindle§, since many drivers there were  with tax incentives.The UK government is keenly aware of the hypocrisy. The government must publish updated clean air plans by 24 April, but the prime minister, Theresa May, has indicated she does not want to punish existing diesel drivers. She says she is ※very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars, and we need to take that into account§.While national governments wring their hands, it is cities that are taking the lead. In Germany, Berlin has  the oldest, highest-polluting diesel cars from its centre, while Munich is developing a clean air ban that will bring in some form of diesel ban in 2018. The Spanish capital, Madrid, has now introduced  on the roads during smog outbreaks, based on odd or even number plates on alternate days; various other cities have experimented with similar trials.In January, Oslo city council introduced a ban on diesel cars for the first time, halting their use completely for one day (during a high pollution alert). The city also plans to raise the road toll for diesel cars entering the city centre from 33 Krone (?3) to 58 Krone (?5.50) in rush hour.The cities that have moved boldest have been the ones least likely to get too concerned about the fact that motorists, having been told one thing, are now being told another. Some have worried this could lead to a damaging kind of cynicism 每 a more skeptical attitude toward the latest environmental research. But councillor Lan Marie Nguyen Berg of Oslo＊s Green party doesn＊t think that will happen.※It＊s a long time ago now,§ she says of the old pro-diesel incentives. ※Since 2012 we＊ve been talking about how bad (diesel) is for people＊s health, and people are adjusting to the science. In the past year we＊ve seen quite a big change in attitudes. People are well aware of the health implications now. They don＊t think children and elderly people should have to stay in their homes to avoid pollution.§Paris has been typically one of the more aggressive cities. Under mayor Anne Hidalgo, it introduced  to classify cars types and emission levels. Any diesel-run car made before 2000 will not be allowed on the roads inside the French capital. Diesel cars built between 2000 and 2010 could soon be subject to tighter restrictions, as the mayor tries to phase out diesel entirely by 2025. Some French drivers are unhappy. A national campaign group, 40 Million Motorists, says the new system is unfair to poorer diesel drivers who cannot afford to buy a new cleaner car.Romain Lacombe, founder of , a Paris-based organisation that monitors air quality around the world, is not persuaded by their argument. He backs the new system because ※it means the oldest cars will be the first off the road, which makes a lot of sense§.※The stock of [diesel] vehicles will take time to be phased out, but I only see momentum building to move away from diesel,§ says Lacombe. ※There is a rising understanding of how damaging to health diesel emissions are. People are beginning to realise they are the first victim of their own vehicle. It＊s a personal health issue, a life or death issue.§Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has stopped short of an outright ban on diesel, but he has ordered the replacement of the capital＊s current diesel bus fleet with clean alternatives. The mayor＊s office will also enforce a ?10 toxicity charge, or T-charge, on the highest-polluting cars entering the city centre as of October. The measures are part of a wider plan to create an ultra-low-emission zone (ULEZ) in central London from April 2019. Khan has expressly urged drivers to ※ditch dirty diesel§, and has backed it up by urging the UK government to come up with a ※national diesel scrappage fund§ to fairly compensate diesel drivers, suggesting a sum of up to ?3,500 offered for each car or van taken off the road.The black cabs are, in some ways, a litmus test of whether diesel is on its way out. Many of the cabs use diesel, and drivers had initially complained about clean-air restrictions. But the Licensed Taxi Drivers＊ Association (LTDA) now backs Khan＊s idea of a scrappage fund. And last month the government and City Hall both announced a  giving cabbies ?7,500 to buy new electric models built in Coventry. Steve McNamara, general secretary of the LTDA, predicts diesel cabs will be ※a thing of the past§ within six years. Although nearly three-quarters of all the world＊s diesel cars are driven on European roads, bold moves are being made elsewhere, too. Hong Kong has introduced  to help phase out older diesel vehicles. Later this year Seoul will ban all diesels made before 2006 from a .But it is in Mexico City, where mountains surrounding the metropolis help trap a semi-permanent blanket of smog over the city, that mayor Miguel ?ngel Mancera has decided to ban diesel completely by 2025. ※I know it is a good thing for the city,§ Mancera said on a recent visit to London to meet Khan＊s team. ※It＊s something that is absolutely essential to protect the environment. We＊re changing: our taxis have to be electric or hybrid, and our buses are being changed from diesel to new technologies.§The mayor has also pledged to invest more in the public transport system and cycling lanes, and persuaded delivery companies to use their diesel trucks at night to reduce daytime emissions.Will this work in a city where drivers are famously unruly? Mancera points to the 1992 scheme called  (No Driving Today), which forbade the worst-polluting vehicles from being on the roads one day a week; the  have since been tightened to include a Saturday daytime ban for the worst polluters. ※It＊s totally unpopular,§ Mancera says. ※It＊s the most unpopular measure you can make 每 to stop people moving. Some people support it, but another part of the population get really irritated by it.§ But nevertheless, he says drivers will get used to the diesel ban the way they did to Hoy No Circula. ※When it is essential, you just have to do it.§Worldwide, polls suggest citizens of some big cities are beginning to put clean air before convenience. A YouGov poll last year showed 52% of Londoners would support a ban on diesel cars in London＊s city centre; a similar poll in France on a ban on diesel in the centre by 2020 was backed by 54% of Parisians.This is probably how the death of diesel will come about 每 not through regulation, but through consumer disgust. Many auto experts expect  that followed Dieselgate to continue, as consumers turn up their nose and manufacturers correspondingly invest less in new models. ※The regulations will deter people, at least people in big cities, from buying diesel cars at their next purchase if they think they are going to be restricted,§ says professor David Bailey of Aston University.Are car buyers entitled to have any confidence at all in buying diesel, or do we need to get rid of it altogether? Unfortunately it is difficult to determine precisely how the latest breed of diesel cars compare with petrol ones, pollution-wise. Since the Volkswagen scandal, no one has a great deal of faith in emission testing done in the laboratory.A tougher on-the-road testing regime, the ※real driving emissions§ (RDE) tests, is set to begin across the EU in September. ※There is a going to be a tightening up on testing and it will make diesels cars more expensive to make,§ says Bailey. ※It will mean a lot of diesels cars disappearing, because it won＊t be worth it for the manufacturers. ※I think a substantial reorientation will take place away from diesel, part of a larger shift away from the combustion engine toward electric cars in the 2020s.§According to Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, a UK motoring research group, ※the mere talk of action might already be altering buying behaviour§. He points to a . But Gooding also argues that schemes to remove the highest-polluting diesel cars from the roads are impractical, mainly because working out exactly how ※dirty§ a car is remains difficult. ※The issue is not just the age of a car, but where it＊s driven, how far it＊s driven and under what conditions,§ he says. ※Unfortunately, the data needed to target the most polluting vehicles accurately is not easily available.§If smog-choked cities want the shift away from diesels to happen as quickly as possible, they will need the help of regulators 每 and also overcome the indifference of national governments. Oslo still has to convince the Norwegian transport ministry to approve its road toll hikes. Mancera will have to persuade the national government to replace the fleet of federally controlled diesel buses that chunter into Mexico City each day.Yet the prize for hastening the decline of diesel could be huge 每 not least because, with so many big climate battles ahead of us, it would demonstrate that we and our political leaders can fix crises when science identifies them. ※I＊m optimistic we can see the end of diesel vehicles,§ says Berg. ※The end of diesel would be a pretty big change in a relatively short period of time.§"																																																			
"The outlook for America＊s public lands is shifting, with  in a move that could diminish access and result in a sell-off to private interests. President Trump has also ordered Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to consider resizing 27 national monuments, . Currently, national land makes up almost a third of the US, with 640 million acres across the country held in a public trust. We asked readers to tell us what these natural, public spaces mean to them and share their experiences and memories from the parts of America that are, for now, preserved for all Americans.I need the wide open spaces, the solitude and the silence. As a photographer, I crave the open landscapes, wild animals and great skies. This land is where a herd of wild horses roam and live in Utah. I often spend time with them, just soaking up their spirits and the quiet, vastness of the land.I think transferring land to the state level is a huge mistake. The desire for money from these ventures would override everything else. Public lands are public and need to be managed with that in mind so that our future generations will have wild spaces to visit and find themselves in.Public lands are a place to escape the madness and stress that everyday life presents. They are a place to unplug our electronic devices and relax. I am an amateur photographer and I love taking pictures in our parklands, and when I am able to get a picture without masses of people, it delights me. I want my grandchildren to hear the yips of coyotes, the howling of wolves and the wild herds of mustangs and buffalo on the prairies and mountains.I plan on voting for candidates that have these same desires and I know that some of my current representatives have betrayed the views that I thought they shared. I am a hiker, camper, kayaker and bicyclist. I love being in the outdoors as it brings me an inner calm. These lands need to be preserved so that future generations can continue to find themselves, as I have. They should not be mined, drilled or developed in any way. If cattle ranchers need to use the land for grazing, they need to be sensitive to environmental rules and pay their usage fees. It is not their land. It is our land.Unfortunately, I fear that the kleptocracy that we live in has sold our heritage to the highest bidder. Public lands are for  of us to be able to enjoy and use. These lands were set aside for all of us, not just the rich to plunder their resources and pollute. It is yet another symptom of the fall of our representative republic.I am fortunate to live within 2m acres of wild national forest. It is a challenging place to live, with top predators part of the landscape. Scorpions, rattlesnakes, black widows and so on are part of daily life. The incredible beauty that surrounds us, however, makes it all worthwhile. One cannot live here and not be aware of the natural world. It is a gift that has enriched our lives and given sanctuary to the creatures that have been here for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years. We must honor the things that give us life and remind us that we are part of nature, not the owners thereof. Public lands are my escape from a crazy world. I love riding out alone and seeing wildlife or tracks and listening to the wind and my horses＊ hoofbeats, seeing trees, smelling nature, seeing natural beauty.I just rode in those grasslands (pictured above) and had the wonderful experience of seeing two rare Mexican gray wolves chasing elk, right behind us! It was amazing. Nature as it should be.The federal government must allot more money to the forest service, instead of taking money away, then saying the forest service is failing. I want all the lands that are federal lands to stay federal lands.I visit public lands quite frequently to view wildlife and get away from people. The peace and tranquility it brings is awesome. The scenery is what nature intended you to see. Not the hustle and bustle of human traffic that [a transfer to the states] will bring. We need to save these lands for the future of everything that＊s pure. Lands are sacred and should remain as such for the people of the future. Less domestic livestock, no trophy hunting ever. These lands were meant to be pure and provide homes for what wildlife we do have left.It is my go-to place to recover, heal, relax and spend time with my children making memories. If I could, I would spend at least one day a week exploring the land, skiing, fishing, watching the wildlife, including mustangs, elk, deer, wolves, buffalo, etc. It is a place of recovery from crazy, busy lives! These are the open lands where our history lives.Public lands have always played a large role in my life. I grew up in a house that backed up to a park on a dead-end street that offered access to undeveloped forrest along the Chemung river that runs through Elmira, New York. I spent the majority of my youth playing between these two places and going to the many spectacular state parks of the Finger Lakes region. When I was in the Boy Scouts, public lands took on a larger role in my life. With my troop, I hiked and camped all over the public lands of New York and Pennsylvania. Those excursions were where I escaped from the stresses of life and were I learned the most about myself. Their protection is what I want to work for.This picture (above) was taken in Castle Valley, Utah. Three friends and I (far right) camped there below Fisher Towers for two of the most spectacular nights of camping in my life. The splendor of the muddy waters of the Colorado river as it slithered like a snake through the valley will always be with me.Public land has been essential to the formation of my character and overall self. I am an avid hiker and climber and I would not be who I am today if I hadn＊t had the chance to develop a sense of independence and humility through my interactions with the natural world. I live in North Dakota, a state that comprises more than 70,000 square miles of prairie yet has among the lowest proportion of dedicated federal land in the nation. The transfer of federal lands to state oversight means that more of the US will, in time, look like North Dakota, with oil derricks and mining operations located next to, or inside of, park space. The bleeding of public lands for one-time, non-renewable sources of profit feeds a cycle of abuse and waste and degrades the quality of life for those who live on and with the land.The picture above is Cracker Lake, located on the east side of Glacier national park 每 a 15-hour drive from my home. If the distance to Glacier were twice that, it＊d still be worth the annual trip. I grew up in the west and public land was always a short distance away〞and one of the things for which I am most proud of our country. It＊s simply natural to me that much of the land in the west is set aside for public benefit. This picture (above) was the view from an overlook off of Skyline Drive in Shenandoah national park in Virginia. It＊s the first national park my spouse and I ever visited.The large western states that are lobbying for a transfer of federal land to them have not had a history of successfully managing their existing public land, so transferring federal land to them would be rather poor idea."																																																			
" am a professional bodybuilder and was on my way to the gym, around midday, in November 2016, in my home town of Stoke-on-Trent. I typically work out for five or six hours a day, and can bench-press 180kg. As I?approached my car, I saw there were lots of ladybirds on the door and roof. I picked one up to take a?closer look. As a kid, I always loved ladybirds, but these didn＊t look like normal ones; they were a different shape, almost twice as big and black with orange dots. I let them walk over my hand, then brushed them off, got in the car and didn＊t think anything more about it.Not long after, I felt a sharp pain on my left-hand side, around my neck. At the gym I told my mate that something didn＊t feel right. The pain had spread to my left foot and it felt as if it was burning. He told me to get a grip and stop moaning. I did my normal workout and then drove for a couple of hours to Milton Keynes, where I was due to present trophies to winners of a bodybuilding competition the next day.I arrived around 7pm and checked into a hotel. My foot was still hurting, but I thought it might be from all the driving. Later, I?couldn＊t sleep. In the early hours, I looked at my foot: it was very badly swollen and looked like a giant＊s. I?was shocked. I thought maybe I＊d dropped something on it or knocked it at the gym. I knew I had to get to a?hospital, but I couldn＊t walk.I called reception and the concierge helped me out of the room and took me downstairs in a?luggage trolley. I got a taxi to the hospital, where they took an x-ray and did a blood test. They weren＊t sure what was wrong, but advised me to take antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, as they thought I?might be having an allergic reaction. I left the hospital around 7am, with a crutch, made a quick appearance at the bodybuilding competition, then managed to drive home, still in a lot of pain.By the evening my foot was black and a friend rushed me to the Royal Stoke University hospital. After more blood tests and more confusion, a consultant from another hospital was called. He arrived and told me to strip off, so he could examine every part of my body. He noticed that the left side of my groin was swollen. He said my body was trying to fight an infection. I was 31 and very fit. I＊d never been ill in my life.He asked if I＊d touched anything unusual or cut myself recently. I said no. He asked if I＊d been near any chemicals. No. Had I been near any insects? That＊s when I remembered. I thought mentioning the ladybirds would sound stupid, but I told him anyway. He asked me what kind of ladybirds they were 每 did they look different? I explained the colour and the size. He said they sounded like , an invasive species. I＊d never heard of them and was shocked to learn they carry a?fungal disease in their saliva.The doctor diagnosed severe sepsis, caused by a ladybird bite. I?didn＊t even know ladybirds could bite. He told me the saliva had got under my skin and into my system, and I needed to take very strong antibiotics and morphine. There were a lot of nasty side-effects, but?I?was lucky: one out of three people die from the severity of the sepsis I had. There was a?chance they＊d have had to amputate my leg, which terrified me. It would have ruined my life.Afterwards, I couldn＊t walk properly for a long time and was in a lot of pain. I couldn＊t eat 每 my weight dropped from 100kg to 75kg, which for a bodybuilder is a?very bad thing. It really messed me up and it took me a long time to?recover.Since then, I＊ve had a phobia of ladybirds. I don＊t mind snakes or spiders or wasps, and I＊m not scared of any other kinds of insect, but ladybirds 每 I just don＊t want to be near them. I know I＊m so much bigger than they are, but it was such a terrible experience. Before this happened, I used to think they were cute and harmless; I used to play with them as a child. Now, if I?see a?ladybird, I run. As told to Sophie HaydockDo you have an experience to share? Email "																																																			
"With reference to Michael McCarthy＊s article (, 1 April), I am a forest school leader in an urban primary school where forest school is part of the curriculum. Children also attend an after-school club working towards completing the John Muir award, which encourages conservation through exploration. Accredited level one in forest school is a current option for young people aged 14-plus but is not being commonly accessed.Forest school exposes children to nature while having fun and helping them develop physically, socially and emotionally. I have seen the positive impact on children＊s behaviour as well as their interest in, enjoyment of and care for the natural world. The latest excitements have been robins nesting and frogs spawning, both of which have initiated some interesting conversations. Last week＊s school holiday activity was by bus to the countryside. We cooked food, played games, paddled in streams, made and raced boats, climbed trees, created tree faces and generally engaged in nature＊s playground, while observing and respecting habitats. Our latest development as a school is to provide forest school training at levels one to three.Opportunities for children to learn about and engage with?the natural world do exist and with a collaborative approach could be so much more accessible throughout the education system. It does not need to cost a lot of money and from my experience the benefits both to children and nature are definitely worth it. The real problem of air pollution in schools (, 8 April) is not just from external traffic emissions but from bad indoor air quality. The World Health Organisation and many other bodies have confirmed that indoor air pollution is five times more dangerous than external. Hazardous emissions from modern building materials containing formaldehyde, isocyanates and flame retardants cause respiratory and allergic problems. A school in Manchester was recently found to have formaldehyde levels 10 times higher than WHO safe limits. This caused teachers and children to have sore throats, irritated eyes and breathing problems, not to speak of the potential cancer risk. While we should try to reduce vehicle emissions, this is blinding us to the much greater risk from hazardous chemicals built into school and other buildings. These chemicals affect most school buildings across the UK, not just in the traffic hot spots shown in your map (, 4 April). Indoor air pollution in increasingly airtight, badly ventilated houses and buildings is a much greater scandal than traffic pollution."																																																			
																																																			
																																																			
"he sun had risen over fields of oats and gone down on a prairie of stubble, yet still the skylarks sang. Though the world beneath their wings had been transformed, they continued exulting or lamenting in twilight overtime. I listened to two, three, or many voices intermingling at the fading of the day, but whether they sang in the sky or gave their evening show from the ground, I could not tell.Other voices came too, though intermittently. Restless flocks of geese seeking rest crisscrossed between land and lakes. Numbering no more than a dozen at a time, they passed low overhead, their wings making a fuzzy buzz. The birds were muted but not mute; single birds made bleating calls that to me were riddled with anxiety at the approach of night.The bat recorder in my hands stirred, though I heard nothing. For just a few moments, I saw a straight-winged bat fly off into or over a tall hedge, but anything else was beyond my senses. The detector screen came to life. ※Recording＃ finished, recording ＃ finished.§ Days later sonograms on a computer would show that noctule, common and soprano pipistrelles had been making an ultrasonic din as we walked alongside that hedge.The circuit of this bat survey ended where it had begun, in a small copse beside the fields where, by now, the skylarks had fallen silent under a blue-black heaven. Somewhere in the wood, a baby tawny owl that slept in shade and woke at dusk was squeaking for attention.Torches off, we trod carefully as the canopy closed over us, our steps guided by memory and the path of least resistance; if there was no vegetation tapping and raking at our ankles then we must still be on the track. I stopped, turned in a stupid attempt to locate the owl, and became disoriented. A steep-sided, water-bottomed ditch that had been on my right was now ahead, behind, to the left or the right? I was lost and fearful, caught by the impenetrability of total darkness."																																																			
" is on the edge of a financial cliff, with years of cuts and under-investment impacting on the sector＊s stability and calling its long-term sustainability into question. Many have been waiting with bated breath for a long-term government solution to this growing crisis, and while some action has been taken, it has not been anywhere near enough to save the current system, which is completely unsustainable and at real risk of total collapse.An immediate funding settlement of at least ?1bn will help stave the pressing financial issues, but ultimately, this only presents a short-term solution, stabilising the sector for the next year. A one-off payment, no matter how much, will not help to preserve the future of vital social care services, which enable older and disabled people to live with dignity, independently and as active members of their community. If it truly wishes to guarantee the future of the sector, the government must also provide a strategy and long-term agreement on how we, as a society, fund social care, and what care options should be available.With the spring budget looming, it really is now or never for social care. Financial woes can no longer be ignored; the government must resolve the critical issues the sector is facing and finally deliver the funds and long-term sustainability plan it urgently requires. We are writing as representatives of some of the organisations who demonstrated on Saturday in support of the NHS. We were delighted that hundreds of thousands turned out in support of our world-renowned free healthcare system and in opposition to further privatisation and underfunding. Health workers and users from across the country were well represented and demonstrated the scale of opposition to government policies. We fear, however, that this Tory government is determined on further cuts in real terms to our health service, to care of the elderly and to other public services. We would like to place on record our continued opposition to these cuts and to government austerity policies, and to stress that this demonstration was only the beginning of a mass campaign to reverse these inhumane and damaging cuts. We urge  to use his budget this week to fully fund our vital public services. We are not prepared to see the services our parents and grandparents fought for be destroyed.                      When the chancellor commends his budget to the House of Commons this week, he will most likely claim that he is setting Britain on a path to a shared society. But such a claim will only be justified if he announces much-needed support for those who are not just about managing, but just about managing to survive 每 the 49,000 children across the UK with life-limiting conditions and their families. At a time when the number of these most vulnerable children is increasing, government funding for the services they rely on is being cut. Last year local authority funding for children＊s palliative care charities was cut by a staggering 61%. This despite the fact that the cost of delivering lifeline care to these most vulnerable children and families rose by 10% in the same year.?As a first step to rectifying this, we are calling on the chancellor to increase the size of the NHS＊s grant to children＊s hospices and announce measures which remind councils, CCGs and health boards that they have a responsibility to these children and their families who care for them 24/7. We ask this on behalf of our 900 members, including children＊s palliative care charities, hospices and professionals doing their best for seriously ill children, and on behalf of the 49,000 children with life-limiting conditions because their voice goes unnoticed too often. They too deserve a quality of life, however short. Dieselgate has been described as one of the greatest public health scandals in living memory; and last week researchers at MIT estimated an extra 1,200 deaths from the use of VW＊s defeat devices just in Germany. The equivalent figure for the EU is around 5,000. Yet there is no indication that the chancellor has any plans to protect the public from the reckless and illegal policies adopted by car manufacturers (, 6 March). If the government increased fuel duty and vehicle excise duty for diesel cars, then the monies could be used to invest in non-polluting technologies, and the UK could become a world leader in clean energy and green transport. Instead we have an administration that rivals President Trump in its addiction to fossil fuels. Conservatives may well be ※instinctively hostile to the taxation of wealth§ as Matthew d＊Ancona asserts. Not surprising really, as most Conservative politicians are themselves wealthy. But most private wealth is inherited and that inheritance is created not by effort but by asset bubbles, particularly in housing. Failure to tax wealth thus gives a huge advantage to those lucky enough to own assets in parts of the country where asset inflation has been highest, surely no incentive to that other Tory value of hard work.Taxation of wealth on transfer, whether  or on death, is the fairest tax of all. It has no losers, only disappointed expectations. It puts wealth created by public policy back into public benefit. It should also reorientate capitalism away from its current rapid drift towards a new aristocracy, where unjust rewards accrue to those least in need, and calm house price inflation. The debate on inheritance tax (, 2 March) focuses on the wrong issue: the lower threshold for IHT. The real problem is the upper threshold 每 not a precise value set by parliament, but we all know it exists. Above it are so many exemptions, trusts, loopholes, schemes, dodges and scams, that IHT becomes entirely voluntary. Two-thirds of Britain＊s 60m acres are owned by 0.4% of the population, and are largely exempt from IHT. As this land never comes to market, these grotesque perpetual fortunes distort life for the other 99.6% of us. If massive landowners had to pay 40% IHT, like anyone else, it would raise tens of billions per year; 92% of people never pay IHT. It＊s a tax you don＊t have to pay until you＊re dead; and land cannot be hidden or removed to a tax haven; what＊s not to like? The Brexit campaign promised that millions saved from EU contributions could support the NHS. Now the chancellor tells us (, March 6) that he needs to use billions from tax revenues that could have gone to the NHS to deal with ※uncertainties arising from Brexit§. Hmm. ※You can fool all the people some of the time...§"																																																			
"Australian voters would back a new low emissions target over emissions trading as a policy to reduce carbon pollution, but are not sure about including ※clean§ coal in the mix, according to the latest Guardian .The latest survey of 1,785 voters, which follows Tuesday night＊s three-hour Coalition party room meeting in which significant concerns were ventilated about the , also taps significant community concerns about the rising threat of terrorism in Australia.Seventy-four per cent of the sample said the threat level in Australia had increased over the past few years, and 46% believe the Turnbull government should be spending more on counter-terrorism measures.A new clean energy target is the centrepiece of the  by Australia＊s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, handed to the prime minister and the state premiers on Friday.While Coalition MPs spent Tuesday night arguing about the impact of the clean energy target on power prices in the biggest internal Coalition stoush about climate policy since 2009 每 and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said afterwards  whether the Coalition would ultimately adopt the policy 每 Australian voters seem sanguine about the idea.Forty-five per cent of the Guardian Essential sample preferred a low emissions target to carbon trading, while 20% endorsed an emissions intensity scheme. Thirty-six per cent said they didn＊t know which option was best.The voters most likely to prefer a low emissions target were people aged 65+ (51%), Liberal/National voters (51%) and high-income earners. Greens voters preferred carbon trading to a target. Government conservatives, egged on by the Canberra-based lobby group representing the resources industry, are pushing to have high-efficiency coal included the new scheme, but the new poll suggests voters aren＊t sure.Asked whether they thought coal generation with 100% capture and storage should be considered a ※low emission§ energy source under the proposed low emissions target, 27% of the sample agreed, 29% said no, and 44% of the sample weren＊t sure.In an interview with Guardian Australia this week,  if governments went on to legislate a clean energy target that ※incentivised§ new coal-fired power stations.He also pointed out that modelling commissioned as part of the review did not predict any construction of new coal-fired power. ※Under the modelling, none came in,§ the chief scientist said.But with internal pressure mounting from conservatives, the prime minister used question time to insist Finkel had proposed a clean energy target which ※does not penalise coal, [and] does not prohibit the construction of a coal-fired power station or indeed a gas-fired power station§.Turnbull said: ※What he seeks to do there is to provide incentives for lower emission technologies including, but not exclusively, renewables.§Frydenberg repeated that sentiment after the internal debate at special party room meeting. ※Dr Finkel has made it very clear he is not putting in place any prohibitions on coal or any form of generation capacity§.※He is putting in place incentives for lower emission generation. It is not a price on carbon or a tax on coal. Indeed, it has similarities to what John Howard put forward back in 2007§.Voters most likely to think coal should be in the mix were Coalition supporters (36%), men (33%) and older people. People most likely to have the contrary view were Greens voters (55%), people under 24 (37%), and South Australians (35%), with that state having a high proportion of wind energy. With the energy fight expected to drag on for many weeks as the government finalises its response to the Finkel review, this week＊s Guardian Essential poll has Labor still ahead of the Coalition in the national political contest on the two party preferred measure, 52% to 48%.The gap between the major parties , but within the poll＊s margin of error, which is 3%. This week＊s two party preferred result was the same as last week.The apparent narrowing of the gap between the major parties has come at a time when terrorism has been firmly back in the headlines, both domestically and internationally.The survey asked voters whether they approved of the way Turnbull was handling the terror threat. Forty-seven per cent approved of the prime minister＊s handling of the issue, down 9% since October 2015, and 24% disapproved, up 7%.The questions in 2015 were put to voters during the Turnbull honeymoon 每 shortly after he took the Liberal party leadership from Abbott.Voters most likely to approve of Turnbull＊s handling of the issue were Liberal/National voters (68%) and people aged 65+ (61%). Men (51% approve) were also more likely to approve than women (45%).Interestingly, the group most likely to disapprove of the prime minister＊s approach were voters signalling their intention to vote independent or other (38%), followed by Labor voters.Forty-six per cent thought the government should be spending more on anti-terrorism measures, which is up 7% from when the question was previously asked in March 2015, and 9% thought the government should be spending less (down 3%).Voters were asked about the balance between security and personal liberty. They were asked whether they thought there should be more restrictions on rights and freedom for some people so there could be more security for others 每 or whether they thought laws already went too far in restricting freedom.Fifty-four per cent thought there should be more restrictions on rights and freedom in an attempt to combat terrorism. Twelve per cent thought current restrictions went too far, and 19% thought they struck the right balance.People more inclined to support restrictions were older voters (79%), ※other§ party and independent voters (68%) and Liberal/National voters (66%).The cohort most likely to think the right balance is being struck were Greens voters (36%) and young people (29%).Concern from voters about the threat level was roughly the same as when questions were previously asked eight months ago.Voters most likely to think the terror threat had increased were older 每 88% of 55-64 year olds, and 87% of over 65s 每 as well as Liberal/National voters (81%)."																																																			
"he most inspiring sight I witnessed during a recent trip to northern Greece was entering small villages and finding  plonked on telegraph poles and the occasional church tower.The ancient Greeks invented the idea that these magnificent black-and-white birds deliver newborn babies via the story of Gerana and Hera (Gerana is turned into a stork by the goddess Hera and the image of Gerana?seeking to retrieve her baby son in her beak has stuck with us), and many European peoples have believed that storks nesting on homes brings good luck.The modern Greeks have built platforms on top of telegraph poles for their storks and seem to live alongside them quite happily, as do dozens of sparrows that make their homes inside the storks＊ nests.Storks are .

"here is no escape from the air you breathe. Or is there? Last year 169 places across the UK registered illegal levels of air pollution, according to . Londoners, in particular, should be waking up to the toxins they inhale, with pollution levels in the capital breaching annual legal  in the first five days of this year.When a problem arises, however, a nimble entrepreneur will spot an opportunity.

Drayson is a former science minister and CEO of Drayson Technologies, which brought the  to market two years ago. Drayson explains that the Clean Space ※tag§ sits on a smartphone and continuously measures levels of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere. Each tag feeds back local pollution readings to a centralised point. This information is then merged with data from other sources to create a map of how pollution hotspots emerge and evolve over time.The Clean Space tag is available for ?49.99, so is not cost prohibitive, if not altogether cheap. So far, thousands of units have been sold around the world. The company now has 200m data points to draw on and the mapping information is becoming increasingly detailed.Drayson says the immediate benefit of his product is that people 每 those particularly interested include individuals with a health condition, who exercise outside or with young families 每 can learn more about pollution spikes in their neighbourhoods and physically avoid those areas. Though he doesn＊t see his company as a campaigning organisation, he does describe the technology as ※providing people who are engaged in lobbying [against air pollution] with the best possible information§.Market analysts  see promise in emissions prevention technology, which is being developed to bring vehicles that run off non-carbon-based fuel to market. ※A Chinese car manufacturer recently launched a carbon-independent vehicle covered in solar panels,§ says David Pugh, an IDTechEx technology analyst. ※There＊s a lot of growth potential in this area, though [that growth] is probably 10 years away.§As with all new technology, however, alternatives to carbon-powered vehicles are expensive. ※I think it＊ll really start with governments: Birmingham now has electric buses, San Francisco has a full electric bus fleet.§ However, Pugh adds that IDTechEx is  for air quality sensors alone will rise to $3bn (?2.5bn) by 2027.

Then, in 2015, he moved back to the UK and set up his own venture in the same field.Cambridge Mask Company＊s USP is that its masks include a filtering technology developed by the UK ministry of defence. Dobbing says these masks don＊t just filter particulate-based pollution 每 the kind that is responsible for smog 每 but that they also filter virus-spreading pathogens and the colourless pollution that tends to come from petrol vehicles.While China accounts for the majority of the company＊s business, UK sales have seen an uptick of late. Dobbing attributes this, in part, to wider media coverage of pollution and the problems it causes. Press interest led to a 250% increase in Cambridge Mask Company＊s website traffic in January, which boosted sales.While traffic has now fallen back to usual levels, the company has seen a strong year-on-year growth in the UK. ※Inventions to reduce pollution exposure have a rapidly growing market, but are also in a competitive marketplace,§ Dobbing adds.According to Dr David Green, an environmental scientist at King＊s College London, the best way of reducing high concentrations of particles and gases is to stop them getting into the atmosphere in the first place. He is sceptical of some inventions purported to clean polluted air such as titanium oxide ※paint§ coatings intended for exterior walls, which are said to catalyse, and so reduce, the amount of nitrogen dioxide in the air. ※There is no strong evidence that they work,§ he says. A chemist by background, Green is more positive about a new nitrogen ※scrubbing§ technology created by London-based company . Sophie Power, Airlab＊s co-founder and CEO, explains that the company 每 which has been working on the tech for a couple of years 每 is looking to launch a UK pilot project later this year to monitor air pollution at bus stops. Last year, Power and her team tested their tech, which works by neutralising nitrogen dioxide as well as filtering other pollutants such as particulate matter, on Marylebone Road in London. They saw positive results.Cleaning polluted air is fairly new; where did Airlab＊s idea from? ※We were very frustrated that emissions weren＊t going down and [wanted to] find ways that action could be taken,§ says Power.Since then, the company has been trying to gather interest. ※We are trying to raise awareness so that we can create public pressure to start a pilot project in London. We＊ve offered it to TFL for free; it＊s really hard to gauge traction.§ If Airlabs can＊t gain a UK base for the tech, Power says it will move on to the Chinese market.A recent  from Friends of the Earth showed that although two-thirds of respondents were concerned about air pollution, only one in 10 thought the air they breathe is bad. However, Power does think awareness of the risks of pollution exposure is growing. ※People in general are more aware, even talking to my friends 每 they thought I was crazy [in what I was doing with Airlabs] two years ago 每 now they say they understand.§ "

Speaking at the opening of the national people＊s congress in Beijing on Sunday, Li admitted his country was facing a grave environmental crisis that had left Chinese citizens desperately hoping for relief.Li unveiled a series of smog-busting measures including cutting coal use, upgrading coal-fired power plants, slashing vehicle emissions, encouraging the use of clean-energy cars and punishing government officials who ignore environmental crimes or air pollution. ※Key sources§ of industrial pollutants would be placed under 24-hour online monitoring in an effort to cut emissions. The premier vowed that levels of PM2.5 would fall ※markedly§ over the coming year but did not cite a specific target. ※Tackling smog is down to every last one of us, and success depends on action and commitment. As long as the whole of our society keeps trying we will have more and more blue skies with each passing year,§ he said. PM2.5 is a tiny airborne particulate that has been linked to lung cancer, asthma and heart disease. Despite his buoyant message, Li＊s language was more cautious than three years ago when he used the same opening speech to  and warn that smog was ※nature＊s red light warning against inefficient and blind development§.There has been public frustration 每 and  每 against Beijing＊s failure to achieve results in its quest to clean up the environment. Tens of thousands of  reportedly fled China＊s pollution-stricken north last December as a result of the country＊s latest pollution ※red alert§. Wei Song, a Chinese opera singer who attended Li＊s speech, said it was inhuman to ※achieve development goals by sacrificing the environment§ and called for tougher measures against polluters.※The government should increase the penalties in order to bankrupt the people and the companies responsible. Otherwise, if the punishment is just a little scratch, they will carry on polluting,§ said Wei, one of China＊s ※three tenors§.Zhang Bawu, a senior Communist party official from Ningxia province, defended China＊s ※much improved§ record on the environment. He claimed the number of smoggy days in Beijing was now falling thanks to government efforts and he said his province, which is building what could become , was also doing its bit.Ningxia＊s frontline role in a Chinese  meant 40% of its energy now came from renewable sources, Zhang said.

He has a lot of respect for her.§ Spicer was also forced to answer questions about his own position, after the  reignited speculation that a major staff shake-up was imminent.In , Trump＊s longtime attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a request for documents from the House intelligence committee, as reports claimed that former national security adviser  was reportedly now prepared to provide documents to the committee＊s Senate counterpart.

"More than half of the British public believe  across the UK are damaging to their health and almost two-thirds back proposals for new laws to tackle the issue, according to research.Canvassing the views of 1,670 adults, the survey found that 58% believed the current levels of air pollution in the UK to be either harmful or very harmful to health, a figure that rose to 73% among Londoners. What＊s more, 65% of those polled said they would support a new Clean Air Act to tackle the issue. The study, undertaken by YouGov, was commissioned by the environmental law organisation  on behalf of the campaign for a new . Launched this week, the campaign is a coalition of organisations, charities and activists 每 including Greenpeace, the British Lung Foundation and Sustrans 每 calling for fresh legislation to reduce air pollution. ※This poll clearly shows that people across the UK want the prime minister to get serious about the toxic and illegal levels of air pollution,§ said James Thornton, the chief executive of ClientEarth which is leading the coalition.※This is an urgent public health crisis over which the prime minister must take personal control,§ he added. ※She must listen to the country and come up with a credible plan that will reduce air pollution as soon as possible, so we are not choking on illegal levels of pollution until 2025 or beyond. The time for excuses is over.§Poor air quality is a growing issue in cities  and is linked to a host of health problems, including ,  and . ※It＊s no exaggeration to say that air pollution is a public health crisis. It contributes to up to 40,000 early deaths a year across the UK,§ said Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation. ※Toxic air is a risk to everyone but hits those with a lung condition, children and the elderly hardest.§The problem is acute. Last month it was found that parts of London had exceeded their annual legal limits for  (NO2) in the  while January＊s cold, still weather exacerbated problems , with multiple regions rated as having high or very high pollution levels, and the capital put on high alert. Last week, the European commission announced it was  against the UK for its failure to keep to agreed limits on air pollution.But while the study suggests the majority of Britons would back attempts to improve air quality, the fervour appears to be split along  lines. Those who voted to leave the EU were less concerned about air pollution, less likely to support the banning of diesel vehicles in areas of high pollution, and were less inclined to place the burden of addressing the problem on the government＊s shoulders; while 67% of remain voters held the government among those chiefly responsible for keeping our air clean, only 47% of leave voters felt the same. By contrast both camps strongly believed the motor industry and other businesses linked to air pollution should lead the way.What＊s more, while half of remain voters said air pollution had worsened over the last eight years, those who voted leave were more sanguine, with only 36% believing the problem had grown. Although 57% of leave voters support a new Clean Air Act, with mooted measures including reducing traffic and shifting to low-emission vehicles, only 33% felt that when Britain leaves the EU, there should be stronger laws on air quality in Britain. More than half of remain voters said they supported stronger laws.Simon Birkett, founder and director of Clean Air in , part of the new coalition, stressed the need for action, adding that any legislation should ensure powers and responsibilities are given to the mayor and local authorities to tackle the problem.※Sixty years after the first Clean Air Act, which fought respiratory problems from short-term exposure to visible air pollution from coal and wood burning, we need a new Clean Air Act to address newly understood health effects that include heart attacks and strokes from long-term exposure to invisible air pollution from diesel fumes,§ he said.A government spokesperson defended current plans to tackle the issue. ※We are firmly committed to improving the UK＊s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. We have committed more than ?2bn since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emissions vehicles, we support greener transport schemes, and have set out how we will improve air quality through a new programme of clean air zones. ※In addition, in the autumn statement, we announced a further ?290m to support electric vehicles, low-emission buses and taxis, and alternative fuels.

Water at five persistently failing beaches met the minimum standard for the first time, but six beaches failed.However, bathing water in Scotland was notably more polluted than in England. , 17 beaches out of the 84 monitored had an ※excellent§ classification, 38 were ※good§ but 17 failed. In Northern Ireland, 20 out of 23 beaches were classed as ※excellent§ or ※good§, and only one failed. Wales had not posted its results on Tuesday.The Environment Agency acknowledged that the English results, which cover the past four years, reflected dry summer weather in 2016. This saw less polluted water spill into the sea from drains, sewers and farms. ※The 2015 results included the 2012 bathing season, which was notably wet with subsequently poorer quality. While the 2016 bathing season started wet, weather conditions improved during the course of this season,§ said the agency.Environment groups welcomed the results, but warned that standards must not be allowed to slip. ※The continuing improvement of England＊s beaches and bathing water are a terrific success story. Ministers must now ensure that this is not the high water mark for the quality of our coastal environment 每 and that the tough EU rules that have driven these vast improvements are kept no matter what Brexit looks like,§ said Friends of the Earth campaigner Samuel Lowe.※These results are welcome. Europe＊s water directive, combined with the safer seas service which monitors bathing water pollution on an hourly basis at over 100 popular beaches, means we have the toughest water quality standards in the world,§ said a spokesman for Surfers Against Sewage.  Bathing water pollution, which can cause eye and ear infections and gastroenteritis, has dramatically improved since EU bathing water regulations were introduced in 1976. In 1991, the water off more than one in four beaches in Britain was considered too dirty to bathe in. The threat of heavy fines and beach closures by the EU in the 1990s forced British water companies to spend billions of pounds to limit discharges of pollution from raw sewage and animals.Since 2006, when standards were further raised again by the EU, water companies have had to spend hundreds of millions more pounds on treating water before it is discharged into the sea.The money spent on avoiding pollution is thought to have contributed to a significant rise in the number of people choosing to holiday in Britain and visit beaches in 2016. The latest figures show almost 14 million people chose to holiday at an English beach in 2015 - up 7% on 2014, said the Environment Agency.※We will continue to ensure bathing waters are maintained and improved further, so we need partners and the public to work with us to reduce pollution,§ said Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency."

The G7 had shown issues such as climate change are not side issues that can be left to others.§He refused to speculate on the US decision, but he said: ※Trump was a good listener, a pragmatic guy and open to debate.§The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he was not going to lecture any country, but he added: ※You cannot build a strong economic future unless you are protective and mindful of the climate.§ Others warned the US president that he risks a stampede, as others in the 195-nation agreement use American withdrawal from the treaty to reduce their own commitments.Trump retained the option of pulling out of the treaty altogether or, more likely, scaling back on the specific commitments made by the Obama administration. Obama pledged to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26%-28 % below 2005 levels by 2025.Computer simulations suggest earth temperatures could rise by as much 0.2C if the US pulled out of the UN treaty altogether.Feverish negotiations by G7 officials until 3am on Saturday failed to forge a closer consensus, reviving the era when George W Bush was alone among G7 leaders in expressing scepticism about climate change.The White House had signalled at the start of Trump＊s tour of the Middle East and  that the US would not make a decision on climate change until after the summit, but other G7 leaders, such as Merkel and Macron, hoped they could collectively persuade Trump to commit to the principles of the Paris accord.During the presidential campaign Trump railed against the damage the Paris deal would inflict on traditional US industry. At the summit, his aides said that although his own views were evolving, he would always put the interests of US industry first.In an assertion of US unilateral power, Trump also forced the Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni 每 the summit host 每 to shred plans for an ambitious statement stressing the plight of migrants was a global rather than regional responsibility.Italy had chosen Sicily as the venue for the summit as the symbolic bridge between Europe and Africa. As many as 200,000 migrants are due to reach Italy this year from Libya, and already more than 1,300 have drowned seeking to make the crossing.During the two-day summit in Taormina, the Libyan capital Tripoli has seen more than 50 deaths in militia infighting, Egypt has twice bombed alleged Islamist training camps in southern Libya, and more than 2,000 refugees have crossed the Mediterranean to the Italian mainland, with scores drowning.Italy had planned a five-page G7 statement on human mobility, stressing migrants＊ rights, their positive contribution to host nations and the threat they faced from traffickers. Instead the final statement highlighted the right of nation states to secure their borders, and set migration targets.Trump also shot down Italian plans on African food security, days after the White House revealed plans to cut American foreign aid by a third. In 2015 the G7 committed to lift 500 million people out of famine and malnutrition, but instead famines have spread in Africa.Friederike R?der, director at ONE, the aid charity, said: ※In a year of greatly-diminished expectations, the G7 have managed to set a new low. The early promise of this summit was crushed by the Trump administration＊s hostile negotiating posture and the evident lack of ambition.§Trump did concede some ground in the final leader＊s statement by signing up to a pledge to oppose protectionism. His aides insist he wants free, fair and reciprocal trade.In a win for the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, the statement was expected to repeat a pledge from the Japanese hosted summit in 2016 to respect a rules based multilateral trade system embodied in the WTO.But Trump still intends to target German trade practices and its surplus, a stance resented by Merkel.At the end of the summit, Trump chose to give no closing press conference, presumably to avoid questions on whether he knew of his son-in-law  to set up a secret communications channel with Russia.Trump instead chose to address US forces stationed in Sicily, reprising the themes of his first foreign trip and making no mention of the climate change dispute.He said simply that he had staged a series of productive meetings with his allies at the G7, but again opened fire on Nato nations for failing to spend enough on defense, claiming contributions were starting to rise in a way they would not but for his election.Accompanied by his wife, Trump often cut an uneasy, even glowering figure in Sicily. His aides insisted he had not sought to dominate the discussions and had enjoyed the free-flowing conversations, likening them to a family dinner. Economic adviser Gary Cohn said: ※He came here to learn. He came here to get smart. His views are evolving which exactly as they should be.§The two days, along with the mini Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday, were seen as a chance for Trump to define his ※America First§ slogan, and test its compatibility with multilateral institutions such as the G7. At one point, Trump was seen ostentatiously not wearing translation headphones as Gentiloni led a discussion on African growth. "																																																			
"lmost as staggering as the  is the dramatic slowdown in urbanisation that will follow it. The world is literally going to town on urbanisation 每 but it is a project that is both immense and historically fleeting.In less than 100 years, the world＊s urban population is expected to double to 8 or 9 billion 每 accounting for the bulk of a . Yet in all the centuries that follow this one, cities may add, at most, another billion to their ranks. So if this century is the most urbanising in history, it will also mark the end of humankind＊s ※great urbanisation§ era.Thus the next few decades will be hugely influential in determining the patterns of production, behaviour and governance that humanity locks into, and the innovative efficiency with which it utilises the earth＊s resources. The future of the world＊s urban population will mostly be built in our lifetimes. The consequences of bad government and inaction over planning and urban design will last decades or centuries. Once the urban population is stable, and road, rail and utility networks have been laid down, it will be much harder to undertake reform or retrofit urban infrastructure. This is why the subject deserves the urgent attention of policymakers, academics and business entrepreneurs worldwide.This week, global leaders are meeting in Marrakech for the 22nd UN climate summit (). They are discussing how to limit greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to hold global warming well below 2∼C, . If new cities are built on a carbon-intensive, resource-hungry model, then all hope of meeting these ambitious targets will be lost.The good news, however, is that it  possible to meet these targets in a way that improves wellbeing and stimulates global productivity and wealth. Innovative, well-run cities are uniquely placed to solve these major global challenges, in conjunction with national governments.Humans work best in cities, that＊s why we＊re moving there. The clustering of people generates higher productivity and higher wages. A mix of specialisation and diversity generates a fertile environment for innovation in ideas, technologies and processes.But urbanisation also creates its own problems, in the form of pollution, congestion, poor health, crime and waste. Unregulated, unplanned urban sprawl is often the cheapest option in the short run 每 but the long-run costs to society, the economy and the environment can be dire.At the UN＊s  conference in Ecuador last month, global leaders and urban experts signed into force the , a blueprint for the next 20 years of urban transformation. It set out an ambitious and laudable vision of more compact cities and public transport-based development 每 but the real test will be in the implementation.Turning words into action requires overcoming domestic opposition and providing finance to the cities most in need. This means recognising that climate action can deliver local benefits to citizens, even in the short term 每 and it＊s why the , which came into effect last week, set out to bring city actors together with national players through the . Already, 7,100 cities from 119 countries have committed to the associated , pledging to support meeting national targets.With the cost of renewable and energy efficiency technologies having fallen to levels competitive with conventional fuels (even before accounting for the unpriced costs associated with the latter＊s use), the opportunities from urban action to reduce emissions becomes plain to see. Be it through investing in electric vehicles, building smart grids, constructing energy-efficient homes, planning limits on urban sprawl, investing in renewable power or providing integrated public transport, such action generates a number of important benefits 每 not least, tackling the growing and deadly problem of  all over the world.Air pollution costs millions of lives every year. The  estimates that premature deaths resulting from a single particulate pollutant (PM2.5) totalled approximately 432,000 in 2012 in Europe alone, while around 75,000 people die each year as a result of prolonged exposure to NO2 air pollution. A  by the World Resources Institute put the health impacts in China of PM2.5 exposure (including premature deaths) at a shocking 10-13% of the country＊s annual GDP.Thus, air pollution is one key reason why the  found that more than half of the reduction in global emissions required to meet an ambitious climate target could generate net benefits to the economy.Implementing policy action to reduce emissions is often easiest at the city level. This means increased effort is required to devolve administration to the urban level and empower cities through greater fiscal autonomy. Things like recycling schemes, energy from waste, broadband networks, integrated public transport systems, ※smart§ buildings and biking networks are easy to appreciate and can come with popular local support.Local accountability is also a vital part of good governance. In large parts of the world, this means fighting urban corruption and supporting institutional capacity. Corruption stifles incentives to work and innovate, undermining property rights and threatening to usurp the returns to productive activities. This offsets many of the benefits of urban clustering, and risks rendering cities dysfunctional.The tragedy is that some of the poorest cities in the world are also the fastest growing 每 and they lack the resources and capacity to prevent locking into structures that are inefficient, unreliable and polluting.New mechanisms to finance investments in urban infrastructure and smart technology need to be developed. These may include: greater use of land-value capture mechanisms, where the construction of new transit infrastructure is financed with the profits generated by the increase in land value stimulated by the presence of that infrastructure; municipal bonds such as Johannesburg＊s recently issued $136m (?110m) green bond; and the creation of dedicated national, regional or city-level investment platforms as mechanisms for aggregating smaller infrastructure projects and attracting private investment at scale.But successful urbanisation is not just about infrastructure; it＊s also about skills. Mexico and Rwanda have invested heavily in urban vocational and technical training. Investment in talent and skills (from jobs training programmes to secondary education) helps raise wages, attract talent and promote urban growth. It also improves the flow of information vital to civic inclusion and effective governance. In other words, there must be continued innovation in governance and learning from best practice. To learn from each other and demonstrate the benefits of sustainable planning and decarbonisation, urban policymakers should develop and utilise city networks such as , the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (), the  and United Cities and Local Governments (), which all facilitate the sharing of experience.Cities are at the heart of the process of human development, innovation and productivity growth. The world is moving to cities, and those we build over the next few decades will broadly define the urban centres we are stuck with for generations to come. Cities that are poorly planned risk leaving humanity with a hostile and potentially deadly climate.The clock is ticking. Humanity has a narrow window of time in which to plan and design its future. That opportunity must not 每 and need not 每 be squandered."																																																			
																																																			
"here is the fiction about climate change?§ . It＊s a good question: glance at most publishers＊ catalogues and you would never know that humanity was facing the greatest challenge of its existence. Laline Paull＊s two novels to date have brought humanity and narrative to the changes already under way on Earth 每 and unlike most environmentally conscious fiction, they＊re intended for a mainstream audience. Her Baileys shortlisted 2014 debut  followed the life of a single lowly bee; its anthropomorphised bee characters smiled and wept and shouted in joy, enchanting critics and readers with their richness and warmth.Her second novel, , focuses on human intrigue in the warming Arctic: in its opening pages, a glacier calves to reveal a body, several years dead, and the novel plays out as an inquest into this death. By embedding a mystery in layers of melting Arctic ice, Paull brings narrative tension to a phenomenon readers typically encounter only in environmental or scientific reporting.The body, we learn early on, is former Greenpeace chief Tom Harding, who had been persuaded to lend his integrity to a scheme dreamt up by his old friend Sean Cawson, a businessman and the novel＊s protagonist. The men bonded over a mutual fascination with the Arctic as students in Oxford＊s Lost Explorers＊ Society, before growing apart as adults. The plan that reunites them is to build in the Arctic ※an inspiring venue in which to promote the reconciliation of business and environmental ethics§ 每?precisely the bifurcation that has divided their friendship. With a habit of leaving little to deduction,  continues: ※And here they were, the two of them, actually living out that conflict, at this very second.§As that quote suggests,  tends towards allegory. As characters take the stand at the inquest, they seem to represent various attitudes to conservation, each given an opportunity to have their say. Here＊s Sean: ※The Arctic is melting ＃ While some people are wringing their hands, treaties fall wildly out of date and business capitalises. So choose denial, or choose 每 like I did, like my partners and I have actively and responsibly done 每 to be at the vanguard of those changes and make sure they happen in?the most positive way.§ Later, a professor of ocean physics, called upon?to testify about the changing conditions in the Arctic, asserts that Tom＊s death ※can itself be attributed ＃?to the reckless endangering of our planet by every industry that ignores the environmental recommendations for how to operate, and to every government that fails to abide by the?Paris Agreement.§All this polemic is rather a lot for the characters to carry, and at times the fiction wears thin. Critics praised  for kindling concern for a threatened species through rich storytelling, without grinding any axes. That novel was an exercise in empathy and imagination. By contrast,  is structured as a blame game, its setup going straight to the heart of responsibility for and appropriate responses to climate change. If the primary concern is to spread an environmental message, this is ideal. If the goal is to?write a nuanced piece of character-based fiction, it＊s less so.And if the environmental message is the novel＊s primary concern, it＊s somewhat weakened by the circumstances of Tom＊s death. Ghosh concluded that literary writers have avoided writing about climate change because they deem it too strange for fiction, that they dread inspiring incredulity with extreme and unpredictable events even as such events become the norm.  is built around an extreme event, and it inspires some incredulity 每 though not, as Ghosh suggests in his piece, incredulity that such an event could happen; rather that it should dovetail so neatly with the tensions between characters. In the context of the novel, it＊s actually rather predictable. This forces the destabilised Arctic to make sense on a human level, which is precisely what it will not do.Nonetheless, the final pages are a triumph. Here, Paull slips into a more nuanced mode, delivering fragmented reports on places and players: we flit between a pub, a plane, a car crash, a?shipwreck and news reports. It＊s a rousing passage that, in its simultaneity and its resistance to simple causative relationships, brings the novel closer to the complexity and truth of life and of nature. is published by Fourth Estate.

"My friend John Abbott, who has died of cancer aged 63, was a talented mathematician and liberal-minded individual who improved the air that we breathe. John was the first (in 2005) to understand that nitrogen dioxide concentrations were not decreasing as expected. A decade later, this is now widely known and understood, with diesel cars being particularly high emitters, and has led to a revision of the vehicle emission standards in Europe.John was born and brought up in Bishop＊s Stortford, the son of Peter Abbott, a technical telecommunications officer with the Civil Aviation Authority, and his wife, Jean, a BT telephone operator with BT. He excelled at Newport grammar school, Essex, and graduated with a first in chemical engineering from Leeds University. He joined the Warren Spring Laboratory, Stevenage, which was then a government lab. There he developed improved methods for efficient bulk handling of materials, contributing to greater energy efficiency and the suppression of pollution.When the lab was privatised in 1994 into AEA Technology, later becoming Ricardo-AEA Ltd, he progressed from a government scientific officer to being principal consultant and project manager for air quality impact assessment.Thanks to John＊s work, key air pollution regulations were introduced that were enforceable by local authorities. He also developed analytical teaching and technical support for non-experts.John led a review of short-term air quality action plans for the European commission as part of its Year for Air in 2013, which saw a fundamental review of the air quality directive.? He also developed the science that formed guidance now used throughout the UK to assess the impact of biomass combustion on air quality. This is regularly used in assessments for planning applications.He was a quiet and humble man with disdain for the material world, but whose zest for life and sharp sense of humour cheered others along. His only ire, as a lifelong Guardian reader, was reserved for what he perceived as the incremental dismantling of support for the vulnerable in society.Outside work, he enjoyed climbing with friends throughout the UK and in the Pyrenees, and also sailing, dancing, travelling, pub quizzing, having a pint and music.He is survived by his mother, his brother, Nick, and his sister, Jane."																																																			
"A push by the shipping and oil industries for a five-year delay to curbs on toxic sulphur emissions would cause an extra 200,000 premature deaths from lung cancer and heart disease, according to an unpublished International Maritime Organisation (IMO) study. Fatalities from illnesses such as asthma were not covered by the leaked paper, which was based on shipping satellite data and modelling work. The shipping industry is by far the world＊s biggest emitter of sulphur with SOx levels in heavy fuel oils  than those in current European diesel standards for vehicles. A single large cruise ship can reportedly burn , and emit more sulphur than 7m cars.At the end of October, an IMO meeting in London will decide whether to cap the sulphur content of shipping fuels by 2020 or 2025. Current levels can reach 3.5% but the cap would limit them to 0.5%.The 2020 deadline faces fierce resistance from the oil and gas industry association, , and , a global shipping group, which argue that there is not enough low-sulphur fuel available to meet the global demand that the measure would spur.The EU has thrown its weight behind 2020, unilaterally imposing the new IMO standard from then. With China enforcing similar emissions control zones, the new benchmark for 2020 is thought likely to pass, although the US and large flag states＊ positions remain wildcards.James Corbett, one of the report＊s lead authors, told the Guardian that any slippage on the 2020 start date risked grave consequences. ※An IMO policy implemented on time in 2020 could reduce the health burden on coastal communities, particularly in Asia, Africa and Latin America,§ he said. ※The inverse is also true. A delay would ensure that health impacts from sulphur emissions persisted in coastal communities that are exposed, where shipping lanes are most intense and communities most densely populated.§ Egypt, Panama, Japan, India, Singapore, the Philippines and China would be among the countries hardest hit, Corbett added. Sveinung Oftedal, Norway＊s lead negotiator at the IMO, said that domestic health concerns had now overtaken fears about the acidifying effects that sulphur has on Scandinavia＊s lakes and rivers. ※Air pollution from shipping is not just a local or regional, but a global, problem,§ he said. ※The question is whether we can really continue to accept its effects, and the answer is: no, we cannot. The 2020 deadline is needed and it is achievable.§ But resentment in the beleaguered shipping trade is unmistakeable, and a sign of future fights to come in the IMO over shipping＊s CO2 emissions, which roughly equal those from aviation. ※Most shipping companies are not turkeys voting for Christmas,§ an industry source said. ※They＊re under the impression that a decision to delay to 2025 would be of collective economic benefit. In the real world, shipowners are bleeding money. There is total depression in the industry.§ Thousands of container ships belonging to Hanjin, south Korea＊s biggest shipping firm, were left  carrying a ?14bn cargo, after the firm  last month.  The International Chambers of Shipping (ICS) says that imposing the new benchmark in 2020 would cost industry an additional $50-100bn a year, owing to the cost of low-sulphur fuels. Ships today mostly run on cheap blends of the residues and remainders left over from the refining and distillation of crude oil for aircraft jet fuel and automobile diesel. Bimco argues that a premature move to low-sulphur fuels could have knock-on inflationary effects for other fuels, as increased diesel demand overwhelms supply. Lars Robert Pedersen, Bimco＊s deputy secretary-general, told the Guardian: ※Quite frankly, if the IMO decides to ignore these very concrete facts, ships will start to use other fuel streams and there will then obviously be a shortage in those streams and a potential disruption in the flow of energy to supply world markets.§ Corbett estimates the total cost of the measure at $30bn, compared to a value of seaborne trade approaching . Supporters of an early sulphur cap say that its effect on commodity prices such as shoes or bananas would be little more than a few cents. Crucially, a second IMO report seen by the Guardian finds that enough refineries will be available in 2020 to guarantee the future availability of a low-sulphur fuel supply for all the world＊s ships. ※In all scenarios, the refinery sector has the capability to supply sufficient quantities of marine fuels with a sulphur content of 0.5% m/m or less ... to meet demand for these products, while also meeting demand for non-marine fuels,§ it says. A capacity shortage in 2020 would be the only grounds for IMO delegates to delay the proposal, under its terms of reference, which some fear could then be extended indefinitely. In a reflection of differing opinions in the sea freight trade, the ICS is neutral on the timeline for phasing out sulphur, while calling for a speedy resolution of the issue. The oil industry too is ambivalent. One analyst with close knowledge of the issue said: ※Major oil companies such as Shell and BP don＊t have a problem with a move to cleaner fuel in the shipping sector because they have advanced refineries which could sell higher value fuels and increase their revenues and potentially, their profits.§ Later this month, a global CO2 data collection system for ships will be launched. Neither shipping nor aviation firms are covered by the , although the ICS has called for the UN＊s climate pledging system to be extended to the industry.

"peculative fiction usually starts with a ※what if§: what if there was an environmental reckoning? What if we didn＊t have enough water? What if the world was running out of food? What if that was coupled with a catastrophic global financial crisis? What would Australia look like? And how would its citizens cope?Debut novelist Sally Abbott, 57, didn＊t start with the dystopian scenario, although her novel is certainly dystopian; she began with her characters. For her protagonist, Clare, the best years of her marriage 每 and her life 每 seem to be behind her. At night she walks, with no particular destination in mind, around the town in which she lives with her mute husband, subsisting on ever-diminishing government-issued food parcels. After she returns home from her walks, she fills diary after diary with meaningless notes.But even in these straitened circumstances, Clare has a lot to lose. There＊s been an economic collapse and the government is in the process of shutting down ※non-viable§ country towns, forcing people to leave their homes and move to the city. The waiting list for a depressing box-like apartment on the city fringe is years and years. Even those with almost nothing feel like there is still further yet to fall.The story of Closing Down ※grew very slowly§, Abbott tells Guardian Australia. ※I began it around five years ago and I didn＊t really write it in a structured, linear way. It was the main characters 每 the main people that I played around with in the beginning 每 they were very real for me and vivid.§At the time, Abbott was a student of the Faber Academy under the tutelage of the writer Sophie Cunningham. She and other would-be novelists met once a week to develop their work in progress. By the time the course finished, Abbott had about 35,000 words of a manuscript.Abbott won the $10,000 inaugural Richell prize for emerging writers in 2015 for her partly completed manuscript. Named for the late Hachette publisher Matt Richell, the prize invites unsigned authors to submit the first three chapters of a manuscript plus a synopsis. Abbott came across the prize on Twitter and had enough of a manuscript to enter. Her work was chosen over 969 other submissions, and she was later offered a publishing contract, giving her almost seven months to hand in the finished manuscript.Much of the work features a strong sense of place. Before moving into public relations, Abbott, who now lives in Castlemaine in central Victoria, worked as a journalist in regional areas. While Abbott says she deliberately set the novel ※in a non-place§, she nevertheless ※did a lot of driving through the Wimmera and the Grampians, and there are all these little towns that, unless you go off the highway, you don＊t even know they are there§.Abbott had read an academic paper that questioned the viability of many of Australia＊s tiny towns, and the seeds of the book were sown.Dystopian fiction is having something of a moment, with Margaret Atwood＊s 1985 novel The Handmaid＊s Tale being adapted for television and Orwell＊s 1984 reappearing in the bestseller lists nearly 70 years after it was published.Climate fiction, or ※cli-fi§, a sub-genre in which Closing Down might sit, also reflects our very real anxieties about climate change and the resulting economic and social catastrophes.In the near future of Abbott＊s novel, , many of those that are displaced by the regional town closures take to the road, walking along the shoulder and camping out.Abbott also imagined food shortages caused by extreme weather events, and, perhaps controversially, invokes the spectre of foreign ownership, imagining that Australia has sold most of its rural and regional areas to the Chinese government, which farms it for its own population.※I was reading about longer-term impacts about climate change, drought, storms and famine,§ says Abbott. ※And there were also stories about artificial foods and meat made out of chemicals. I wondered how sustainable into the future it was for people around the world to keep eating the way we are eating.§※I know there are bleak parts of the book but I also hoped to some extent that there was a note of optimism. It＊s important that as the world gets more difficult for people 每 that kindness to strangers is as important as it ever has been.§"																																																			
"As so often with long-running series, the  was far less convincing and engaging that its earlier episodes. It felt like it was more interested in setting up the next series than tying up the loose ends in the current one as it raced towards an improbable conclusion. During the last 20 minutes alone the mysterious Balaclava Man was revealed as some unnamed lowlife gangster who had never appeared before and was in any case just one of many Balaclava Men; DCI Roz Huntley finally admitted she had whacked Tim Ifield but omitted to explain why she had spent so much effort trying to frame her husband; several key informants faded out of the script; and almost every police officer in the programme seemed to have a surname that began with H. By the end of the episode I was left feeling confused and a bit cheated. I＊ve no idea what writer Jed Mercurio has lined up for series five, but it＊s beginning to look as if the only logical conclusion is that every single copper in the force is bent and that the finale will involve Steve Arnott, Kate Fleming and Ted Hastings taking it in turns to unmask one another.The solitary red-winged  may be wondering how the hell he is going to get home, but he＊s made a lot of birdwatchers very happy. Dozens have hired planes specially to fly up to Orkney to see the visitor for themselves. I admire their passion. And their good fortune. For 10 years or so I collected King George V booklet panes. For the uninitiated, these are the complete panes of stamps removed from stamp booklets. It was a hobby that helped to drive me insane because though half of those issued were quite common and readily available, the other half were never anywhere to be seen despite all the catalogues and price guides suggesting they were as easy to find. No stamp dealer could ever explain to me why this was so. The only logical explanation was that all the missing panes had all been broken up and their stamps used, as intended, for postage, but this didn＊t come close to explaining why so many other panes had been kept intact for over 80 years. In the end I gave up and sold my collection. It was the stamps or me. But there was a time when I would have happily flown to Orkney to glimpse a booklet pane I＊d never seen.Just hoursbefore , she let out two of her generals, Philip Hammond and David Davis, to take part in their first election campaign event. Normally the prime minister doesn＊t trust anyone but her to stay on message, and you can see why. Though Hammond and Davis did both manage to do what was required by saying ※§ and ※coalition of chaos§ several times, things didn＊t go entirely to plan. First they posed for photographs in front of an election poster featuring Jeremy Corbyn, a nuclear bomb and a slogan that read: ※No bombs for our army. One big bombshell for your family.§ Except Hammond managed to block out the Labour leader, leaving Davis to stand in front of a bomb and next to a slogan that now read: ※Hell for your family.§ Then a Labour supporter managed to infiltrate the event and hand out briefing papers to the assembled media, explaining why spending money on things like social care and nursery places wasn＊t necessarily a bad idea as Hammond had suggested and that Labour＊s plans were fully costed. Bizarrely, a Conservative event with no opposition MPs had turned into one of Labour＊s most successful events of their campaign so far.I＊ve only once seen an athlete break a world record. That was back in 2005 when I took my daughter to Crystal Palace. We were sitting in the stand by the back straight, right next to where the Russian athlete  became the first woman to clear 5m in the pole vault. It was utterly mesmerising and I count myself lucky to have been there. So I can only begin to imagine how pissed off Paula Radcliffe, Jonathan Edwards and Colin Jackson must be that  simply because they were set prior to 2005, the year when the International Association of Athletics Federations first began saving athletes＊ blood and urine samples for testing. The plan has the full backing of Seb Coe, the IAAF president, who is keen to be seen doing anything to make the sport appear clean. I can＊t help feeling that Coe might do more for his sport＊s reputation if, rather than penalising innocent athletes, he was a little more open himself about how he has failed to notice the widespread bribery, doping and corruption that has happened .It＊s sod＊s law that the moment I put the Digested Read on hold for the duration of the election campaign in order to give myself more time to panic about being in the wrong place, several books start arriving that might have been ideal candidates. My favourite is , which begins with the disclosure that she will be taking a leave of absence from her many jobs while her father is in the White House. The book begins with Ivanka having a dark night of the soul on a walking holiday in Patagonia. Should she stay working as a New York estate agent or leave to join her father and brother at the Trump Organization? After several nanoseconds, Ivanka opts to leave. She writes: ※It turns out that soul-searching journey [eight miles in Patagonia] led me right where I belonged. Today, I＊m an executive vice-president at the Trump Organization, co-founder of Trump Hotels and Scion and founder of my eponymous fashion brands.§ Who would have guessed that having a billionaire Dad could have been so handy? But Ivanka also wants to reach out to the little women and advises them to marry the right partner and make time for regular massages.

"It＊s a sunny Saturday morning in South , but Nuvia Perez is keeping her three boys inside.※They don＊t go out to play,§ said Perez, 37, whose front door faces a 21-acre former industrial site in the heart of Jordan Downs, a housing project. ※In the housing office, they say everything＊s all right and not to worry,§ said Perez in Spanish. ※But they have found contamination.§More than a year ago, family nurse practitioner Amanda Markusson noticed a cluster of elevated blood lead levels in the kids she treats near Jordan Downs and started recording test results. Markusson says she has recorded blood lead levels as high as 13-15 micrograms per deciliter, well above the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) threshold of 5 micrograms per deciliter. The  says there is no known level of lead exposure that is considered safe. ※Over 300 children under the age of five currently reside at Jordan Downs, and they are at an increased risk for lead poisoning,§ Markusson wrote in a statement. ※As a healthcare provider in Watts, it is concerning to see a community put at increased risk for lead and heavy metal poisoning simply because of where they live.§The test results recorded by Markusson are one of several indicators of elevated lead and arsenic levels surrounding a former industrial site, in a region with  of lead poisoning in LA County.Resident fears have only been heightened by the lead contamination problems that have blighted other low-income and minority communities in the US, including those in Flint, Michigan; and , Indiana, where more than 1,000 people are now being forced out of their homes.The US housing and urban development secretary recently proposed lowering the level of lead that must be detected in children＊s blood before triggering federal cleanup action. The proposal would affect an estimated 2.9m subsidized and public housing units built before the country＊s 1978 ban on residential lead paint.For decades, the former industrial site in Jordan Downs hosted a steel mill and later a truck and storage repair facility, before the housing authority purchased the site in 2008 to begin a billion-dollar  to transform the existing homes into 1,800 mixed-income units. In 2011, lead was  there at levels as high as 22,000 parts per million (ppm). The residential soil lead threshold for cleanup in California is 80 ppm.The site has since been cleaned up, and authorities have repeatedly assured the 2,700 residents that the environmental conditions at Jordan Downs do not pose an ※§ to human health, and that no testing was necessary beyond the perimeter wall of the site.But residents worry about the additional impact of planned demolition, and they see a recent spate of results as validation of their concerns.Tests conducted last month at several schools within a few blocks of Jordan Downs found lead levels as high as 252 ppm. But Robert Laughton, director of the school district＊s office of environmental health and safety, said the vast majority of the most elevated lead levels were found lower than six inches below the surface, ※or in [other] areas inaccessible to people§.After the test results, Laughton said the district covered all of the areas tested with mulch ※as a temporary cover until we do the rest of the sampling§.The Los Angeles housing authority also released the results this month from soil samples around buildings slated for demolition. While some samples returned with levels of lead and arsenic above the recommended thresholds, the levels did not pose an ※unacceptable human health risk to the residents§, authorities said. But possible lead contamination is only one part of a much wider pollution puzzle at Jordan Downs. Authorities have yet to map the source and full reach of a trichloroethylene (TCE) plume in the groundwater beneath the housing project. TCE, an industrial solvent, can be especially harmful to pregnant women if it seeps into homes through the floor.Cleanup of an underground Exxon Mobil oil pipeline breach at the north-east corner of Jordan Downs has been ongoing for more than eight years. David Starr high school, perched on the south-east corner of Jordan Downs, has been the scene of multiple lead and arsenic cleanups over the past 12 years. Then there＊s the toxic legacy from an old  that operated on the eastern portion of the housing project in the 50s and 60s.※I think that what you＊re seeing is a typical case of environmental racism,§ said Thelmy Perez, housing collective coordinator at the nonprofit Los Angeles Community Action Network, who in April conducted soil tests around Jordan Downs with an XRF spectrometer. More than 50% of the samples taken screened over the 80 ppm cleanup threshold. The highest reading was 346 ppm.※It＊s pretty obvious that the residents are living in a toxic environment,§ she said. ※The problem is, I think [the authorities] see people of color living in a community like this, and they see a lack of power.§"																																																			
"nce it was a day of joy. The fifth of May. A day when even the greyest shades of early summer would be set ablaze by squadrons of yikkering, darting arrows, now screeching recklessly round the rooftops, now twinkling high over the city streets. The day of the sky dolphins.I don＊t think you＊ll find the description in many ornithology guidebooks or birding websites. But that＊s how that first intoxicating contact with the common swift was christened in my household. Though it took a child who had only just started school to make the connection.※You see,§ I remember explaining to my daughter all those years ago, ※these birds have flown  to come and have their babies here. You＊d think they＊d be knackered. But look at them. They＊re dancing and laughing and leaping around. They＊re having a party. Not a care in the world. Like aerial joyriders.§Day of the joyriders? No, the ebullience of these birds, their sheer sense of fun, their ability to set one＊s own spirit soaring with theirs, deserved something more celebratory. Lola came to the rescue. ※They are like dolphins, Dad. Dolphins in the sky.§ What a diamond.But perhaps the most extraordinary thing about the uninhibited antics of these birds was the clockwork discipline that underpinned it. Whether it was Peckham Rye or Hampstead Heath that we sought them, it was always on 5 May that they appeared in the skies over London, as they flooded northwards.And then the flood dried up. Suddenly, violently. My daughter is at university now; by my reckoning London has now suffered 10 swift-less summers. It＊s a similar story elsewhere in Britain (a decline in breeding pairs of almost 50% in the past two decades is the RSPB＊s estimate), and Europe. Yes, the odd flickering silhouette still shimmies through the vista, but the great screeching squadrons seem to have been shot out of the sky.Of course, like all animals that undertake great migrations, swifts are vulnerable to habitat loss driven by climate change and the environmental havoc wreaked by modern intensive agriculture. The aerial plankton of insects and spiders that sustain the birds on their long migrations is being thinned out by a whole range of widely used pesticides and insecticides.  每 associated with the decline of bees 每 are particularly worrying. Research suggests that these chemicals are responsible for the  that support many species of bird.Every year the relentless creep of the Sahara desert, driven by the mechanics of climate change, takes its toll. Even when the migrating swifts have crossed the Med, they find the same .But for me, there＊s another habitat loss, much closer to home, that has turned 5 May into a day of doom: the destruction of the nest sites that turned our towns and cities into prime real estate for swifts.They build their nests in little cracks under the eaves of old brick buildings: but increasingly these are seen as sources of , as a blight on property values, rather than a thrilling spectacle of wildness to be nurtured. Clearing out nests and sealing up eaves to shut out the returning birds is now a . As breeding swifts pair up for life 每 and often use the same nest year after year 每 there is an irrevocable violence in this process.It seems that this tiny bird 每 weighing about the same as a Creme Egg 每 can overcome the ordeals of climate change and the chemical warfare waged by farmers. But  are a bridge too far.More than 50 years ago,  woke us up to the annihilating power of insecticides such as DDT. Today, with the disappearance of swifts from the skies over our cities, could be the start of a silent summer."																																																			
"As a climate scientist, I spend time and energy studying how fast the Earth is warming and what is causing the warming. This knowledge helps us predict what the future will look like. But, what most people are interested in is, ※how will it affect me?§ Some impacts we are pretty clear about, like the impacts related to sea level rise, increased storms and heavy precipitation, and increased drought and heat waves 每 particularly the impacts these events have on the economy. But climate change will affect us personally as well (by personally, I mean our physical person). In fact, climate change is already affecting personal human health around the world. This subject was the focus of  just published by the . What I really liked about this report is that it breaks down some of the key impacts by region. Unfortunately, the report is limited in scope to the USA. However, the general conclusions and trends can be illuminating for people outside the USA as well. What was also welcome is that this report was prepared by physicians (not climate scientists) of major medical societies and the conclusions are based on the best available and current information of both the climate and health fields.So what did they find? Perhaps most importantly they find that climate change is already affecting our health. This isn＊t a future problem for the next generation. It is a problem that is present and growing. They also report that some populations are more susceptible to climate change effects. Among the most vulnerable groups are children, student athletes, pregnant women, elderly, people with chronic health conditions, and the impoverished. A third key takeaway is that the problems will get much worse as climate change continues.The study reports that if you live on the West Coast, wildfires, extreme temperatures, poorer air quality, extreme weather events, and agricultural risks are occurring. On the East Coast, you can add vector-borne diseases as a risk area. The central USA region is also similarly being affected.As you dig deeper into the report, you learn about how these various climate-related features are affecting health. Each factor is dealt with by three questions: 1) What is happening? 2) How does it harm our health? 3) Who is being harmed?For instance, with respect to extreme weather, the report correctly notes that the frequency and severity of some weather events such as heavy downpours, floods, droughts, and major storms are increasing. This harms our health because these events can cause direct injury and death as well as displacement. Extreme weather can also harm vital infrastructure like communication systems, homes, and reduce the availability of clean water and food. Finally, extreme weather can lead to acute outbreaks of infectious disease while at the same time reducing access to health care.Air pollution is another example area.  is affecting air quality in many ways, including increasing chemical reactions in surface air (air we breathe), increasing pollen, and leading to more forest fires. Lower air quality obviously affects people with breathing problems (such as asthma and allergies). It can prolong the pollen seasons and worsen allergy symptoms. Less obvious effects like increased humidity and more heavy rainfalls can exacerbate air-quality problems indoors through mold growth for instance. One issue I was not aware of was the threat of climate change to nutrition. Increases in carbon dioxide actually result in a lowered nutritional value of grown food such as wheat, rice, barley, and potatoes. This occurs because plants produce less protein and more sugars/starches in a carbon rich atmosphere. Plants also are less effective at taking in essential soil minerals. This is all in addition to the threats to our food system by droughts and extreme weather. We＊ve certainly seen very severe droughts in the USA (2011 in Oklahoma and Texas, 2012 in Midwest USA, and ) that have caused severe problems in the agricultural industries.This report was written in an easy-to-understand manner. It is accessible and authoritative. It also gets to the issue people are most concerned about 每 the impact of climate change in their lives. I encourage anyone who is interested to download and read this document at the link above. "																																																			
"A wolf pack is roaming wild in  for the first time in more than 200 years after a young female wolf journeyed 500km from Germany.Male wolves have been seen in Denmark since 2012 and the new female  in farmland in west Jutland after two wolves were filmed together last autumn.It is further evidence that the wolf is , with wolf packs also re-establishing themselves in France and Germany and individuals sighted in Holland and even Luxembourg. Before the new population, Denmark＊s last wolf was killed in 1813.※We expect that ,§ said , a senior researcher at Aarhus University. ※People were very surprised when wolves first appeared in Denmark but they are highly mobile and are just as adaptable to cultural landscapes as foxes are. The only problem historically is that we killed them.§DNA from two faeces samples have confirmed that the female wolf came from a pack 25km south of Berlin in Germany before travelling to north-west Denmark, probably leaving her family group last spring to do so.There is sometimes speculation that wolves are deliberately released into the countryside by unofficial rewilders but according to , a , this female＊s trek north was entirely natural. ※The wolf went on its four legs, it makes complete biological sense,§ he said. Wolves can walk 50km in 24 hours and have been recorded making journeys of more than 1,000km across Europe from Germany, where they re-established themselves in 1998. Germany＊s wolf population is currently growing at 25-30% each year, with the young dispersing across central Europe.Researchers have found wolves in some cases alongside up to 3,050 people per square kilometre 每 higher than the population density of Cambridge or Newcastle.※The wolf is a predator to the roe deer 每 if you can have roe deer, you can have wolves,§ said Chapron. ※As long as we don＊t disturb them, they will be fine in these human-dominated landscapes. In Denmark there＊s no reason wolves can＊t thrive. But the question has to be asked, are people going to accept the wolves? The wolf will need to eat something. When they realise that Danish sheep don＊t taste too bad that may be a little problematic. It will be interesting to see how far we can coexist with big predators.§Denmark＊s wolves have settled in a well-farmed area of heathland and small pine plantations with plentiful prey in the form of burgeoning populations of red and roe deer.There have been reports of wolves killing several sheep in the area over winter but the Danish government has already established a wolf management plan with compensation for farmers and funding so livestock farmers can erect wolf-proof fencing. The management plan, drawn up in consultation with game hunters as well as farmers and conservationists, allows for wolves that become ※habituated§ and live too close to humans to be controlled.※There is a tradition in Denmark of reaching compromises and reaching solutions,§ added Sunde, who said he was optimistic that Danes could coexist peacefully with wolves. ※Technically, we can relatively easily manage the wolf population but the challenge is the psychology of humans. There are so many feelings and opinions about wolves in Denmark, as everywhere. The wolf debate is very much value-driven rather than related to concrete problems.§There are more than 12,000 wolves in continental Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus) and the wolf is a protected species under the EU＊s habitats directive. According to Chapron, southern European countries have often been better at accepting new wolf populations than northern . Several countries with relatively small wolf populations including Finland and Norway still pursue controversial annual culls of the animals.Chapron said he would not like to predict how many wolves could live wild in Denmark. ※Let the wolf decide and let people decide as well because we are sharing the landscape. It＊s very positive news for nature conservation. It shows that attitudes have changed and when we let nature take care of itself, nature comes back.※Forget Little Red Riding Hood 每 it＊s not a myth that is back, it＊s just a natural part of the European fauna.§"																																																			
																																																			
"very civilisation we know of has devised a system 每 scientific, religious, what have you 每 to make sense of the night sky. The mystery of what＊s up there, where it came from, and what it means has been inherited and puzzled over for generations. Those questions may be the most human ones we have.Due to pervasive light pollution 每 glare from excessive, misaimed and unshielded night lighting 每 80% of Europe and North America no longer experiences real darkness. For anyone living near a major metropolis, a satellite image of the Milky Way seems abstract: we understand it to be a document of something true, but our understanding is purely theoretical. In 1994, after a predawn earthquake cut power to most of Los Angeles, the Griffith Observatory received phone calls from spooked residents asking about ※the strange sky§. What those callers were seeing were stars.I grew up in a small town in the Hudson River valley, about an hour north of New York City. Like most children, I regarded the night sky (or what I could see of it) with wonder. I understood that nobody could say for sure what was out there. Little kids are often frustrated by the smallness of their lives 每 as a child, you can conjure complex worlds, but in your own life, you are largely powerlessto make moves. Looking up, the tininess I felt was confirmed, but it no longer felt like a liability. If the night sky offers us one thing, it is a liberating sense of ourselves in perspective, and of the many things we can neither comprehend nor control.※I wish to know an entire heaven and an entire earth,§ Henry David Thoreau wrote in 1856. He understood those worlds as separate, but in some essential conversation with each other 每 to receive one without the other was to misunderstand both. But what happens when mankind divorces itself from a true experience of the cosmos, separating from the vastness above, taming it by erasing it? How can we ever come to know a heaven we can barely see?arkness is a complicated thing to quantify, defined, as it is, by deficiency. In 2001, the amateur astronomer John Bortle devised a scale to help. His classifications range from ※inner-city sky§ (class 9), in which the only ※pleasing telescopic views are the moon, the planets, and a few of the brightest star clusters§, to a sky so dark ※the Milky Way casts obvious diffuse shadows on the ground§ (class 1). Most North Americans and Europeans live under class 6 or 7 skies, in which the  is undetectable and the sky has been smudged by ※a vague, greyish-white hue§. In that kind of night, a person can wander outside, unfold a garden chair, open a newspaper, and read the headlines, if not the stories.In addition to the Bortle scale, scientists often use photodiode light sensors to measure and compare base levels of darkness by calculating the  of the night sky as perceived by the human eye. Unihedron＊s Sky Quality Meter is the most popular instrument for this kind of work, in part because it is small enough to fit into your pocket and also because it connects to an online global database of user-submitted data. According to that database,  每 an 82-acre park in a remote swath of rural Pennsylvania 每 presently has the second darkest score listed. On the Bortle scale, Cherry Springs usually registers between 1 and 2. In 2008, the  (IDA), a nonprofit organisation that establishes and supports dark-sky preserves around the world, designated it a gold-tier international dark sky park.Earlier this year, I drove the six hours to Cherry Springs from New York to meet Chip Harrison, the park＊s manager, his wife, Maxine, and a park volunteer named Pam for a 4.30pm dinner of baked fish. Afterwards, Chip had promised, we＊d go and see stars.※Most children, right now, growing up in the US, will never see the Milky Way,§ Chip said while we waited for our main courses.※Their parents never saw it either,§ Maxine added.※You come to a place like Cherry Springs, you＊re gonna see four or five thousand stars, maybe more,§ he continued. ※I＊ve seen people who are fairly serious amateur astronomers, and they can＊t find their way around this night sky 每 there are too many stars.§After supper, we drove to the park, arriving around sunset and unloading several bags of equipment from the trunk before setting out, together, into the blackness. White light isn＊t permitted on the astronomy grounds, but red-filtered light, which won＊t cause the rods of the eye to become overexposed and less efficient, is allowed, if not quite encouraged.※If you hear crunching, you＊re on the right path,§ Maxine announced over her shoulder. I only presumed she said it over her shoulder. The dark around us was compact, bottomless, sonorous and I was echo-locating poorly. I blinked city eyes. We crunched along a gravel path towards the astronomy field, where Chip was assembling an Orion SkyQuest telescope. The SkyQuest is stout but sizable, about eight inches in diameter, and ideal for locating deep-sky objects such as dim star clusters, nebulae and galaxies.At the edge of the field, a former airstrip, killdeer birds cheeped eagerly, constantly; a woodcock sounded a burp-like call. It was four days after the new moon, and the sky was so black that even the tiny slice of visible moon felt like a bare bulb screwed into the ceiling of an interrogation chamber.On a clear night, from the proper vantage, watching constellations emerge over Cherry Springs is like watching a freshly exposed photograph sink into a bath of developer, slowly becoming known to the eye. Pam pointed the telescope towards Jupiter, which had risen over the east end of the field. The four largest moons of Jupiter 每 Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto 每 were clearly visible through the lens. , in the skies above Padua. They were the first celestial bodies proven to be orbiting something other than Earth. With my face still pressed into the telescope, I gasped.Pam laughed. ※Usually when people look through the telescope, I point out the big ＆wow＊ items, like the planets, Saturn and Jupiter, some of the clusters,§ she said. ※Everybody looks at them and goes, ＆Oh, my God.＊ They go, ＆Is that real?＊§herry Springs is located less than 300 miles inland from the US eastern seaboard, in a region 每 the East Coast 每 that contains 36% of the total US population and is lit up every night like a backstage makeup mirror. When pinpointed on a satellite image, Cherry Springs is in the middle of an uncharacteristically dark patch 每 insulated, on all sides, by hundreds of thousands of acres of protected forest and perched atop the Allegheny Plateau, 700 metres (2,300 feet) above sea level. Most of the small towns surrounding the park are situated in valleys where outdoor light is already sparse. This unusual combination of factors explains, to a certain degree, how Cherry Springs became one of the darkest places in America.Which isn＊t to say the sanctity of the sky here is not being encroached upon. In the last decade, a handful of energy companies have begun extracting natural gas from the  underneath Pennsylvania via hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a much-reviled practice that involves the release of gas or petroleum via a high-pressure injection of fluid through a narrow shaft bored into the ground. In Potter County, where Cherry Springs is located, there are 40 active fracking sites. The work cycle in a gas field is nonstop: energy companies not only rig up colossal, stadium-style spotlights, they also burn off excess gas in open pits or through steel pipes, in a process known as flaring. From afar, a flare resembles a giant blowtorch; clusters of flares are visible on satellite images from space.Chip 每 who is exceedingly kind and mild-mannered, possessing the sort of preternatural calm seemingly required of park rangers 每 has worked out an informal agreement with representatives from nearby wells, in which workers abstain from flaring at night during star parties, when amateur astronomers gather in Cherry Springs to observe and record astral phenomena, or when the park is hosting astronomy-related public programmes. But it＊s chiefly a gentleman＊s agreement, reliant on neighbourly goodwill. At present, there are no light-pollution restrictions placed on energy companies by the state of Pennsylvania.Gary Honis, an electrical engineer and astrophotographer based in Sugarloaf, Pennsylvania, has been visiting Cherry Springs for 25 years, since long before it was recognised internationally for its stargazing potential. Feeling disheartened by the bright skies in their area, his local astronomy group had ※pulled out an old air force map, a satellite map, that showed a dark area in Potter County. We compared that to a Pennsylvania road map, and it was Cherry Springs State Park. That＊s how we found it, by looking at light-pollution maps. My first view was through a friend＊s six-inch Dobsonian telescope, and it was of , the twin galaxies in Ursa Major,§ Honis said when we spoke on the telephone. ※It looked photographic. We never saw that back home.§Chip eventually came upon Honis, tented by foil, peering up at the heavens. The park had been closed for hours, but Honis convinced Chip to let him stick around and take some pictures. Their meeting was serendipitous. With Chip＊s advocacy, the park＊s hours eventually changed to allow for visiting stargazers, who, with the proper permit, can now camp overnight on the astronomy field.Since then, Honis has been outspoken about the effect fracking is having on the skies above Cherry Springs. He＊s posted videos to YouTube 每 often accompanied by ominous music he performs himself on his Moog Theremini 每 linking fracking to declining sky-quality readings. The videos are convincing, showing, via time-lapse photography, how gas flares and unshielded drill-site lights are compromising the park for astronomers. ※We started doing sky quality meter readings of the night sky brightness in 2006, and since then, the skies over Cherry Springs have been getting much brighter,§ Honis said. ※When the fracking started, sky quality readings went very bad.§The nocturnal world, of course, also generates its own light, and those deviations can affect dark-sky conditions. The National Park Service lists numerous natural sources: moonlight, starlight from individual stars and planets, the Milky Way (also called galactic light, or integrated starlight), zodiacal light (sunlight reflected off dust particles in the solar system), airglow (a faint aurora caused by radiation striking air molecules in the upper atmosphere), wildfire, lightning strikes and meteors. Atmospheric moisture or dust particles can refract or reflect that light, amplifying glow (deserts, for example, are low in moisture but high in dust; forests are the inverse). Air pollution makes it all worse.On the night we ventured out in Cherry Springs, Maxine 每 a former game warden, one of just a few women to hold that position in Pennsylvania 每 had fixed her gaze towards the sky. We were quiet. Maxine was wearing a pair of dangly moon-and-stars earrings, which glinted in the starlight. ※This is where the word awesome comes from,§ she whispered.n the 17th century, under the reign of the self-described Sun King, Louis XIV, tallow candles fashioned from rendered beef or mutton fat were placed in iron-framed glass boxes and strung above the streets of Paris. Lamplighters wandered the districts of the city at dusk, unlocking the boxes and igniting the wicks. Other places followed Paris＊s model, and candles eventually gave way to oil and then gas lamps.By 1890, more than 175,000 electric streetlights had been installed in the US; there are now somewhere around 26m, which collectively cost American taxpayers about $6bn in annual energy costs. The idea at its inception was that street lighting would help officials of the state more effectively survey and control city streets after dark. Whether streetlights actually make anyone safer remains a contentious topic among scholars and city planners. Most studies fail to demonstrate an inarguable correlation between street lighting and decreases in traffic accidents or crime, although it feels wilfully obtuse to suggest that taking the dark way home is always just as safe.Street lighting is undeniably pervasive, but it isn＊t the only culprit of our perpetually bright skies. Light pollution is aggravated by any kind of irresponsibly aimed outdoor lighting: stadium floodlights, illuminated billboards, futuristic Exxon stations beckoning tired drivers towards off-ramps with their neat rows of glowing pumps. Proper shielding and direction can mitigate the glare of these emanations 每 which can be blinding 每 and the International Dark-Sky Association publishes guidelines for easily modifying outdoor lighting to be more dark-sky friendly. But in most places, following the association＊s suggestions is optional. The right to light isn＊t easily denied, nor circumvented.In recent years, Chicago, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit and Los Angeles have been swapping the high-pressure sodium bulbs in their streetlights 每 which produced puddles of gassy, orange-hued light, a grittily romantic flicker 每 for comparably cost-effective LED bulbs. The temperature of sodium bulbs is usually around 2,200 Kelvin, which registers to the eye as warm. LED bulbs burn closer to 4,000 Kelvin and emit an intrusive, bluish glare. If you live in a major American city, it is now virtually impossible to spend any time at all outside and in the dark.The new LED streetlights are almost universally described as unpleasant. New York is presently in the midst of its own retrofit, a colossal overhaul scheduled to be completed by the end of 2017. The bulbs last longer and will ultimately reduce energy use by up to 75%, according to the US Department of Energy. But after the new bulbs were installed in Windsor Terrace, a residential neighbourhood in Brooklyn, citizens reacted with disbelief. In an opinion piece for the New York Times, the novelist and Windsor Terrace local Lionel Shriver wrote: ※Although going half-blind at 58, I can read by the beam that the new lamp blasts into our front roomwithout tapping our own Con Ed service＃ These lights are ugly. They＊re invasive. They＊re depressing. New York deserves better.§Susan Harder, the New York State representative of the International Dark-Sky Association and a board member of the Montauk Observatory in East Hampton, has been campaigning aggressively against the installation of LED streetlights in New York. ※We still think that God lives in the heavens, in part because the sky was so dynamic to ancient cultures,§ she explained when I asked her to explain how the problem goes beyond the bulbs themselves. ※How could you ignore a changing, moving night sky? It struck them with awe. They attributed all sorts of things to the night sky. We＊re going to lose that if towns and cities keep installing these LED streetlights.§Harder previously had a career as an art dealer but now works full time as a dark-sky activist. She has the kind of fast-talking, no-nonsense comportment that recalls , and is, by all accounts, a formidable opponent. In 2006, a New York Times reporter described her as ※a virtual one-woman dark-sky mover and shaker§, and characterised her particular approach to advocacy as a ※combination of sweet talk, cajoling and bullying.§The single biggest challenge facing dark-sky advocates such as Harder is working out a way to change our understanding of darkness as a nefarious force, a thing that needs to be avoided or controlled, if not vanquished entirely. What may seem like a logical and instinctive aversion 每 our vision is impaired at night and we are therefore more vulnerable 每 has been socially reinforced via so many avenues that it＊s exhausting to even try to tally them up. From a very young age, we are taught that nighttime is when dubious things transpire. At best, night is considered a middling expanse (※No occupation but sleepe, feed, and fart,§ as the Jacobean playwright and poet Thomas Middleton put it). At worst, it is terrifying.In his book , the historian A Roger Ekirch details the ways in which nearly every known civilisation figured darkness as a source of evil: ※Everywhere one looks in the ancient world, demons filled the night air,§ he writes. Even in our earliest folklore, night is a proxy for wickedness, worthy of trepidation. Christianity positioned God as a source of eternal and unblinking light, a corrective to spiritual darkness and chaos. Torches, candles, oil lamps, gas lamps, lightbulbs 每 these were not only facilitators of productivity and examples of the extraordinary ingenuity of man, but also sacred talismans to ward off ever-encroaching night and the malevolence it supposedly enables.Most historical reasons to fear darkness are now moot; our unease at night is more transcendental than pragmatic. In the US, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 67.5% of violent crimes actually occur during the daytime, between 6am and 6pm. Still, a kind of basic discomfort with darkness persists. Changing deeply ingrained cultural ideas about darkness is a complicated task. It＊s not just darkness we fear, it＊s the vastness and loneliness of the universe, spreading out from here to God-knows-where.I wrote to Ekirch to see how he understood the stakes of the battle to preserve the dark. ※At the least, we stand to forfeit age-old opportunities for human intimacy of the sort that darkness alone enhances 每 not just by affording privacy but by drawing couples closer together physically and emotionally,§ he replied in an email. Then he quoted an anonymous early Italian essayist, who described darkness as its own lubricant for human communion: ※Darkness made it easy to tell all.§Ekirch also evoked the idea that, prior to the Industrial Revolution, the night sky itself was ※a source of inspiration [that] knew no bounds, all the more as vestiges of church and state, to name but two powerful institutions, receded in the darkness,§ he wrote. ※On a moonlit evening in Naples, Goethe felt ＆overwhelmed＊ by ＆a feeling of infinite space.＊ Exclaimed an English laborer in the 18th century as he treaded home from an alehouse: ＆Would I had but as many fat bullocks as there are stars.＊ To which, replied his companion, ＆With all my heart, if I had but a meadow as large as the sky.＊ Today, few modern critics of light pollution, I suspect, could put the case more passionately.§ few weeks before I visited Cherry Springs, I went with a couple of friends to a sensory deprivation chamber in Brooklyn. Formerly a component of psychological experiments 每 and, on occasion, deployed as an interrogation technique 每 sensory deprivation is now being reconfigured as a kind of bourgeois meditation aid: For $99 (?75), you can float for an hour in 30cm or so of heavily salted mineral water (roughly 450kg of Epsom salts per tub), calibrated precisely to your body temperature, inside a sealed, soundproof, lightproof, womb-like chamber. The idea is to disappear a little. The stresses and expectations of a modern life seem to demand an antidote of, well, nothingness.I was not a natural inhabitant of the tank. I spent the first 15 minutes karate-kicking the door open and then pulling it closed again 每 mostly to make sure it would, in fact, still open and close. I pressed the button that turns the lights on and off approximately 50 times. I decided to stretch one hand out 每 ostensibly to see if I could still see it in the dark; I could not 每 and accidentally dribbled warm, salty water into my open eyes.Eventually, once I had tired myself out, I was able to consider the experience of pure darkness, unbroken even by starlight. I understood how people found it curative: there＊s a disassembling that occurs, a loosening of certain grips. But darkness, without the galactic punctuations of the night sky 每 without stars and planets and moons 每 feels more finite than infinite. It feels claustrophobic.On my third night in Pennsylvania, I went back to the park by myself, after midnight. I stumbled on to the astronomy field, wearing a pair of pyjamas underneath my coat. My rental was the only car in the lot. It had been raining earlier that afternoon, and thick, heavy clouds now hung low in the atmosphere, obscuring the moon and almost all of the stars. It was as dark a place as I＊d ever been. There, shivering, I again felt something akin to genuine panic. When the brain is deprived of visual information 每 when all external stimuli are washed out 每 we are alone in new ways. I wondered, then, if the dark acted as a kind of Rorschach test: if our perception of it wasn＊t also a manifestation of our most profound fears. Whatever you conjure there, in the blackness, speaks to your innermost terrors.When I got back to New York, I spoke to Matt Stanley, a colleague at the university where I teach. Stanley holds degrees in astronomy, religion, physics and the history of science. He leads a seminar called Achilles＊ Shield: Mapping the Ancient Cosmos, and another called Understanding the Universe.※I＊ve found that probably 95% of my students come from either an urban or suburban environment, which means they can only see a dozen stars at night, and no planets,§ Stanley said. ※When you say the Milky Way to them, they imagine a spiral galaxy, which is fine, but that＊s not what the Milky Way looks like 每 it＊s a big, whitish smear across the sky. I have to do a lot of work to orient them to what human beings actually saw when they looked at the sky. They don＊t know that stars rise and set. Their minds explode.§An alarmist may wonder if light pollution is threatening the future of astronomy 每 if the skies will eventually become so illuminated that we＊ll no longer be able to identify new celestial objects, given that we can barely see the ones we already know are there. Stanley said: ※The best astronomy nowadays is being done from space. When I did my astronomy degree, I never looked through a telescope. Now, you can imagine a world 每 almost a dystopia 每 where no human being has ever seen a celestial body with the naked eye, but we have fantastically sophisticated astronomy, because we do it all above the atmosphere. It＊s efficient, but it breaks with those initial questions: why does the sky behave like that?§That curiosity was the catalyst for centuries of intellectual and spiritual growth. ※Science, as we understand it, comes from this very old tradition of trying to understand what we saw in the night sky,§ Stanley said. Babylonian astronomy gave us time, later mathematics; astronomy is, in one way or another, central to every foundational philosophy we know. Our instinctive preoccupation with the content of the sky seems tangled up, somehow, with all those other inborn human desires: to know and be known. To feel cowed, sublimated. To wonder and to worship.※The experience of looking up at the sky 每 that＊s what Kant uses to explain the sublime,§ Stanley said. ※In 1788, he said, ＆There are two things that fill my heart with wonder. One is the moral sense within me, and the other is the order in the heavens above me.＊ That＊s an extraordinary feeling, and ineffable. You can＊t describe it, but once you＊ve experienced it, you never forget it.§ Follow the Long Read on Twitter at , or sign up to the long read weekly email ."																																																			
"  winds across the steep southern side of the , slowly climbing the route from Aberystwyth to Devil＊s Bridge. While walking deep in the valley beside the river, I was convinced I could hear the train coming and hurried out of the trees to see it pass. The noise persisted, drifting in and out of my hearing as though the engine were rounding the rocky spurs and disappearing into wooded side valleys, yet no train appeared.Slowly, awkwardly, I realised that the sound was that of the low set of waterfalls further up the valley, distorted and modulated by the strong east wind that was straining the still bare branches of the trees. When I reached the , having taken the sloping path from just beyond the old chapel, it was clear that the river was in spate from the recent rains, with substantial volumes of water pouring over and between the rocks.From the footbridge in front of the falls, the sound of falling water was even more impressive, with a strange pulse that added to the almost hypnotic random noise. In midstream, a series of deep bowl-shaped pits in a rock outcrop showed the true erosive power of this water. Small imperfections in the stone have been worn deeper, creating voids within which pebbles swirl and scour at times of high flow.The sun was still high, but the shadow of the valley side already reached out over the narrow fields of lowland pasture. As sheep enthusiastically grazed the tender grass of early spring, a group of  overhead, pitching and stooping over the conifers nearby. After an extended dispute, all but two moved off, leaving the apparent victors to dive abruptly and perch in one especially tall tree, perhaps a high-status nesting site. I made a note to return here later in the season and see how they are getting on, but the chill of the wind was becoming insistent and I was keen to get moving again 每 further inspired by thoughts of tea and cake."																																																			
"n exuberant rite of spring§ is how the New York Times described 22 April, 1970. In Manhattan, and across America, ※huge, light-hearted throngs ambled down autoless streets.§ Earth Day had been born, an outburst of protest 每 and revelry 每 that involved everyone from save-the-whales activists to opponents of new freeways. Denis Hayes, now 72, was the man tasked with organising it. ※What we did was pull together an event?that told all of those people, ＆You?know you＊ve really got something in common and this should be one big movement where we＊re supportive of one another＊.§It sparked, he tells me, the most profound change in American society since the New Deal. ※We now have different kinds of buildings, different kinds of automobiles, different planes, different lighting, different land use. People are choosing to have diets for environmental reasons, choosing to have one child for environmental reasons.§ And all that, he says, ※didn＊t come from political leadership at the top, it came from a bunch of demands down at the grassroots§.In 1990, Earth Day went international, reaching 200 million people in 141 countries. Now, according to its website, more than a billion participate in celebrations, teach-ins and protests around the world. This year, the Earth Day Network has teamed up with scientists for a rally on the National Mall in Washington DC. Volunteers around the world are convening their own versions of this ※March for Science§, to champion ※evidence-based policies in the public interest§.Vanessa Furey, one of the organisers of the London march, says she was motivated by the ※rise in fake news and ＆alternative facts＊§ during the past year, ※and that quote from Michael Gove [during the referendum campaign] that ＆people have had enough of experts＊§. The experts are fighting back. ※Scientists aren＊t the natural group to go out marching 每 and I know there are some that still have reservations about doing it. But it felt like a proactive, positive move for [them] to come out and say, let＊s get the public involved.§But is there any point in these big days out when the world seems to be hurtling ever faster towards disaster? Last year was the warmest on record, yet progress on environmental issues seems to be going into reverse. Donald Trump is still mulling over whether to abandon the US＊s commitment to the Paris agreement on limiting global warming. Scott Pruitt, the man he appointed to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the creation of which was the original Earth Day＊s greatest achievement, doesn＊t believe the scientific consensus on climate change. The UK government, once a global leader in the campaign to reduce carbon emissions, will be absorbed by Brexit for years. This week it privatised the Green Investment Bank, with no guarantee its mission will be maintained over the long term.※It＊s pretty tough to look at what＊s going on today with clear eyes and not get fairly depressed,§ says Hayes. The challenges facing activists have certainly changed in the 47 years since he became involved, when ※you couldn＊t see 100?yards in front of your nose§ in cities such as Pittsburgh, Los Angeles or Gary, Indiana. ※The easy stuff environmentally is when something poses an immediate threat to you, to your children, to your neighbourhood. When that＊s happening, it is not that hard to organise people and to get them sufficiently incensed to demand change.§Hayes says that it＊s tougher with the big global issues such as climate change, threats to the world＊s oceans and migratory species 每 issues that cross national boundaries and can＊t be solved by any one country acting alone. ※Those?sort of things are all in much worse shape in 2017 than they were back?in 1970,§ he says.But despair, appropriate as it might seem, isn＊t just bad for the soul. A?growing movement of ※Earth Optimists§ believes that it could actually make things worse. In an editorial for Science magazine＊s Earth Day issue, professors Andrew Balmford and Nancy Knowlton argue that ※presenting people with huge problems without solutions leads to disengagement§. They continue: ※Without examples of conservation succeeding, hopelessness could itself emerge as a driver of extinction.§ And there  successes: in Brazil, for example, the rate of Amazon deforestation is down to one-third of its 2004 peak. Chinese investment in renewable energy is set to exceed $300bn by 2020.It＊s those kinds of triumphs, and myriad smaller ones, that have inspired the Earth Optimism summit, also taking place in Washington DC this weekend. In the UK, Earth Optimism Cambridge will carry the torch. Speakers including Jane Goodall, David Attenborough and Steven Pinker will relay ※stories of hope§, and there＊s a ※solutions fair§ with stalls telling people how to consume less and get involved in campaigns. Dr Rosie Trevelyan, director of the Tropical Biology Association, is one of the brains behind the event. She argues that if people dwell on the negative, they won＊t learn what actually works, and what they can do to help.Examples come from near and far. ※We＊ve got someone from the Wildlife Trust, which has restored fenland around here,§ she says. ※It＊s an incredibly important habitat and it had practically?disappeared. I went to a fenland on Sunday and saw a bittern. Bitterns had almost gone extinct in this country, and they＊re now breeding out there.§ One of Trevelyan＊s students from?Ghana will talk about how he and his colleagues managed to save the . When they were selecting positive stories, she says, ※we had to cut loads of them, we had so many. It＊s about making people aware of the fact that we don＊t need to just stand by and watch these things disappear, we can actually do?something.§Earth Day has its detractors, particularly in the US, where environmentalism is seen through the distorting lens of the culture wars. ※Earth Day is a yearly reminder that humanity must be controlled, manipulated and even destroyed for the good of the planet,§ wrote rightwing pundit Glenn Beck last year. He claimed that the EPA＊s ban on the insecticide DDT in 1972 led to millions of avoidable deaths from malaria as other countries followed suit 每 despite the fact that the US wasn＊t the first to outlaw the chemical and continued to allow its use for public health reasons.For Ron Bailey, Reason magazine＊s science correspondent, the mixing of politics and ecology has turned off many?who might otherwise find common cause with the protesters. ※When it was started back in 1970,§ he says, ※there were obvious problems with pollution and so forth that needed to be dealt with. But it wasn＊t an all-out assault on capitalism and market economies, which it has more or less turned into. It＊s very alienating for those who are actually anxious to address specific problems that are occurring in the environment both locally and globally. If the only solution is destroying the economy, you＊re not going to get a lot of?people on board.§No fan of Trump, Bailey nevertheless thinks the scientists marching in Washington today are making a mistake. ※Certainly we should celebrate science and its objectivity, and what this has brought to modernity. But by tying it to Earth Day, they are undermining their message. It automatically tinges them with politics.§ That, he reckons, could jeopardise funding for scientific research, which in the US has tended to be bipartisan.If not a day, though, then what? ※If you＊re interested in these kind of things, then go to your local city council, go to your local legislature, write letters to your congressman, testify at hearings, that kind of thing, about the issues that particularly concern you,§ says Bailey.It is not a colourful solution. For Trevelyan, it＊s not a question of either/or. And while she doesn＊t strike me as particularly political, she believes the reaction to Trump and the new spirit of protest are something to be welcomed. ※I think it＊s mobilised more people to worry about things,§ she says. ※I think we should watch this space. The March for Science has been catalysed by seeing [him] as president. People are no longer being complacent.§Hayes addresses what he sees as the self-harming democratic choices we have made more directly. ※If you happen to be an American or a Briton or a French person or a Turk, it＊s difficult not to be a little bit ashamed of your country. That＊s just a reason not to get despondent, but to get energised and angry and committed.§※In 1970,§ he says, ※we called it Earth Day, but it was really a focus on individual cities in the US and schools and neighbourhoods. As we move forward, I think it genuinely is becoming?＆Earth＊ Day.§ The stakes are higher than they＊ve ever been. ※You?know, this is not one of those casual things that if you win or lose, you?don＊t mind; or you say, ＆Jeez, sorry, we lost that one.＊ We＊re talking now about impoverishing the human prospect for the next 100 generations. We can＊t lose on this.§"																																																			
"A  zoo＊s much-discussed livestream video of its pregnant giraffe showed her giving birth on Saturday.Adventure Park＊s  feed captured the big moment shortly before 10am ET when April, a 15-year-old giraffe, delivered in an enclosed pen at the zoo in Harpursville, a village about 130 miles north-west of New York City. The mother giraffe tenderly licked her calf, which began to slowly pick its head up from the floor of the pen. About 45 minutes after it was born, the calf stood on its wobbly legs for the first time, while its mother helped keep it steady. The zoo later said the calf was male. Its entry to the world, zoo owner Jordan Patch said, ※was unnerving to even those of us who have witnessed animal births previously§. The calf is April＊s fourth, but Animal Adventure Park＊s first giraffe calf. It is expected to weigh about 150lbs (68.04kg) and be about 6ft (1.83m) tall, and will be named through a competition.Its father is a five-year-old giraffe named Oliver, who watched the delivery from an adjacent pen.More than a million people watched the YouTube stream on Saturday morning. Millions around the world have viewed it since it started in late February. April has her own website and even an apparel line.A GoFundMe fundraiser page that initially set a goal of $50,000 sat at more than $125,000 on Saturday morning. The money will be used for the care of the animals.Following the birth, a sponsor＊s logo on the YouTube feed quickly changed from ToysRUs to BabiesRUs. In February the zoo achieved momentary fame after YouTube  when what the zoo  ※animal rights extremists§ alleged a violation of the website＊s ※nudity and sexual content§ policy.Patch, said the decision to pull the stream ※pulled an educational tool away from tens of millions of individuals§.The wait for the giraffe to give birth became an anxiety-ridden experience for some. A songwriter from Farmington, New Hampshire even posted a music video on YouTube called, ※.§ On Saturday, reaction on social media was ebullient and hopeful. Messages on Twitter included: ※We did it, internet! We had a giraffe baby together§, ※Everybody sticking their neck out for this baby giraffe§ and ※On a day where ＆mother of all bombs＊ is a trending phrase, I love how the world unites over the birth of a baby giraffe§."																																																			
"Scotland＊s environment agency has warned the country＊s industries and farmers that their waste and inefficiency is now the biggest threat to the environment, overtaking pollution.In a marked shift in strategy, the regulator＊s chief executive, Terry A＊Hearn, will urge businesses, farmers and manufacturers to adopt a ※one planet prosperity§ policy designed to cut their energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, waste and resource use. ※The major threat to the environment now is that humanity is overusing the planet as a resource base,§ he told the Guardian. A＊Hearn argues that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has largely won the battle against so-called gross pollution from onshore sources. Air, water and soil pollution is now far below the levels seen decades ago. Those were 20century problems, he said. But developed economies such as the UK＊s are now consuming resources at a rate close to three times the planet＊s actual capacity. ※I＊ve been extremely clear that if we have only one planet, we have to be really, really smart about how we use it,§ he said.Sepa, which is sister agency to the Environment Agency in England, has been given greater regulatory power and independence under legislation passed by the Scottish parliament in 2014, including greater freedom to fine polluters. It is now able to levy fines as high as ?40,000 without going through state prosecutors, imposing fixed penalties similar to those issued by police for driving offences, and has discretionary powers to penalize repeat offenders far more heavily for repeated breaches. But Sepa＊s data shows that 87% of Scottish businesses now have a good or excellent regulatory record, with only 7% rated as poor or very poor. A＊Hearn, an Australian who took over as Sepa chief executive last year after running Northern Ireland＊s environment agency, said there were still sectors with ※significant challenges§, particularly the fish farming industry. Scottish salmon farms criticised by environment campaigners and other marine industries for heavy use of toxic chemicals to combat sea lice and disease, and . ※There are still compliance issues here; we need to get on top of those,§ A＊Hearn said.With an overall budget of ?78m, Sepa has seen its government funding cut by about 25% in real terms over the last decade and is absorbing a 6% budget cut this year, down to ?37m. Half its funds come from regulatory fees and other sources, helping cushion the impact of those cuts.A＊Hearn said its inspection regime would remain robust but in an article being posted on  later on Monday, he asserts that sustainable growth is now the core objective of its regulatory strategy.※Our statutory purpose, to deliver environmental protection and improvement in ways which also create health and wellbeing benefits and sustainable economic growth, means that Sepa must undertake a very different role if we are to help create prosperity within our planet＊s capacity to support it,§ he states. The aquaculture sector would be among the first to be approached by A＊Hearn to establish new ※sustainable growth agreements§ which he said will be central to his new one planet strategy. Based partly on a similar scheme he rolled out in Northern Ireland, voluntary but formal agreements would be struck with the most successful or progressive companies, or possibly on an industry-wide basis. Companies which became sector champions would set targets or goals to increase efficiency and cut down waste; it would allow them to publicise that role in their marketing. Some highly integrated sectors such as the whisky industry, which has lately adopted more ambitious environmental policies, could sign industry-wide sustainability deals.A＊Hearn cited a deal signed by the aggregates and cement giant Lafarge on his second-last day as boss of the Northern Ireland agency. Lafarge agreed to pilot a scheme to take chicken manure from a major poultry farm and waste tyres as lower carbon fuel sources to generate the vast amounts of power needed for its cement factory at Cookstown. Environmentalists fear that crowning some firms and industries as sustainability champions could lead to conflicts of interest and tensions for Sepa, if it had to crack down on pollution offences by that company or had to help adjudicate if a sector champion, say a fishfarm, wanted to open a new site or expand in a sensitive area.A＊Hearn said Sepa ※won＊t hesitate§ in telling a firm that wants to expand that it can＊t do so if it fails to protect the environment. ※I don＊t see any tension at all if we do it properly,§ he said. The opening passage of any sustainable growth agreement would ensure the business agrees to meet all compliance standards at all times. ※If it becomes clear that they＊re not willing to sign up to those, it＊s clear then that they＊re not best performers. I will be eyeballing CEO＊s to test that,§ he insisted."																																																			
																																																			
																																																			
"ll my life I have read stories. A few years ago, quite out of the blue, I started to write one. I was 40. My children were two and five. I had a job with fairly long hours; at home, the constant churn of domestic duties. On paper, it was not the best time to decide to start. I couldn＊t even point to a childhood spent stapling books. But for me the urge was irrefusable, unquietable. I had no say in it; it seemed to speak itself, and it happened like this.My neighbours and I had got together to tidy up a patch of wasteland near our houses. For years it had been a dumping ground. There was a rabbit hutch, the rusted bones of old bicycles, mattresses that had rotted to the coils. Every time we pushed a spade into the ground it came up with old bottles, plant pots, plastic bags, dismembered dolls, bones, buttons and glass. There was so much glass. After each rainfall, our turned earth glistened with newly surfaced shards.Sometimes, I felt I was being watched. Years earlier, long before my time, a few neighbours had planted native trees and bushes in the waste 每 hornbeams, maples,  每 so that when you looked up all you saw was green. But still the sensation would make me turn, and then I＊d see, through the tangle of nettles and brambles, the triangulated stare of the fox. He was uncowed by being spotted. He seemed to have an opinion on our work; an interest he appeared keen to communicate. When I dug a hole, for instance, the next day I found the fox had dug a hole inside my hole. When I put down a few rolls of turf, the fox lifted them up.It was easy to read into these moments some kind of human communication. The fox was being pure fox, and nothing but fox, and yet it was possible for a human to feel addressed in a kindred language of gesture and action. My foot was resting on the shoulder of the spade, the sun filtering through the lime leaves. ※I＊m going to write a story. About a fox,§ I said to my neighbour. He looked slightly bemused and said nothing. ※I＊m going to write a story about a fox,§ I said again. I am one of those people who tends to think instead of speaking, so the sound of the words, their conviction, took me by surprise. There were a few of us stood around, but none was as excited about the idea as me.In that moment, I seemed to see the whole thing. It shone for me with a lucidity I searched for during the two years of writing that followed. It would be about a woman who believed herself to be addressed by a fox, and about a fox who would make this interpretation possible while protecting the truth of his intentions, and whose wildness would somehow prevail. I didn＊t know, back then, that the woman would end up going through a sort of emotional rewilding.I knew I wanted to write an urban pastoral. Nature writing, now so popular, remains largely the preserve of the countryside, and I really wanted to write a book bursting with the soundscape of the city. Some of this I said a few months later in an interview for a place on the creative writing master＊s at the University of East Anglia, but that too was a post-rationalisation of what I felt in that moment. The truth is, I just saw the story and knew, after a lifetime of composing sentences in my head, that I must write it.I took a few days off work. Starting was simpler than I thought, because it was possible to make up anything. I had no responsibility to report the truth, only to create it, and it was totally up to me how to do that. (Beginning turned out to be much easier than finishing, when all those truths have created their own logic and must play themselves out truthfully.) I sat at the table in the lounge and looked out the window at the trees in the wasteland. It was so green out there, perspective itself seemed to be made of leaves, and that is what I started to write. For a couple of months, I wrote only at that window, believing that the story was somehow glued to the view. I worried if I peeled myself away, the story might stick behind. But it didn＊t work out like that.I carried the story everywhere, on trains (on the commute to the MA), on the bike, on the fitful weekend jog. At night when I went to bed, I curled up and went to sleep inside it, in the darkness of it, in all its unresolved questions. I can still picture that first sighting of the fox, and of the story, and while I know that other factors must have made me ready for the moment 每 looking back, life was so busy, I think I really wanted to stake out my own territory again 每 the fox, the leaves, were the start of it.The experience of writing was absolutely consuming, but I felt there had never been so much of me.  by Paula Cocozza is published on 6 April by Hutchinson (?12.99).

"A Japanese whaling fleet returned to port on Friday after an annual Antarctic hunt that killed more than 300 of the mammals, as Tokyo pursues the programme in defiance of .The fleet set sail for the Southern Ocean in November, with plans to slaughter 333 minke whales, flouting a worldwide moratorium and opposition led by Australia and New Zealand.The fleet consisted of five ships, three of which arrived on Friday morning at Shimonoseki port in western , the country＊s Fisheries Agency said.More than 200 people, including crew members and their families, gathered in the rain for a 30-minute ceremony in front of the Nisshin Maru, the fleet＊s main ship, according to an official of the Shimonoseki city government.In a press release, the agency described the mission as ※research for the purpose of studying the ecological system in the Antarctic Sea§.But environmentalists and the International Court of Justice (IJC) call that a fiction and say the real purpose is simply to hunt whales for their meat.Anticipating the fleet＊s return, animal protection charity Humane Society International called for an end to Japanese whaling. ※Each year that Japan persists with its discredited scientific whaling is another year where these wonderful animals are needlessly sacrificed,§ said Kitty Block, the group＊s executive vice-president.※It is an obscene cruelty in the name of science that must end.§Japan also  ending in 2016 after a one-year hiatus prompted by an IJC ruling, which said the hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as science and ordered Tokyo to end it.Under the International  Commission (IWC), to which Japan is a signatory, there has been a moratorium on hunting whales since 1986.Tokyo exploits a loophole allowing whales to be killed for ※scientific research§ and claims it is trying to prove the population is large enough to sustain a return to commercial hunting.But it also makes no secret of the fact that whale meat  and is served in school lunches.Japan has hunted whales for centuries, and their meat was a key source of protein in the immediate post-second world war years, when the country was desperately poor. But consumption has dramatically declined in recent decades, with significant proportions of the population saying they ※never§ or ※rarely§ eat whale meat.In response to the ICJ ruling, Japan＊s 2014-15 mission carried out only  such as taking skin samples and doing headcounts.Past missions have been hampered by a . A fisheries agency official said that the whalers this time faced ※no obstructive behaviour threatening safety of the fleet and crew members§ by the group.He attributed that partially to Japan dispatching patrol ships to protect the fleet."																																																			
"Sweden, Germany and  are the only European countries pursuing environmental policies in line with promises made at the Paris climate conference, according to a new ranking study.The UK is in fifth position in  taken by EU states to meet Europe＊s pledge of a 40% cut in carbon emissions by 2030.Poland, the Czech Republic, Spain and Italy are judged to be propping up the league, due to their support for forestry and carbon accounting dodges that weaken the greenhouse gas reduction effort.※EU politicians portraying themselves as climate leaders should put their money where their mouth is by closing loopholes in the EU＊s key climate law and pushing for more ambition,§ said Femke de Jong, the EU policy director for Carbon Market Watch, a campaign group that co-drafted the  survey.The ranking was compiled using ministerial statements and official documents submitted to the European commission, and was then cross-checked with country representatives.It focuses on behind-the-scenes lobby forays mounted by EU countries in negotiations over an ※effort sharing regulation§ to cover the 60% of European emissions that come from transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management.These fall outside the bloc＊s flagship Emissions Trading System (ETS) which allocates tradable pollution permits to heavy industry.Several countries have tried to gain wiggle room in the talks by pushing for measures such as a later (and higher) baseline for measuring their CO2 cuts, or greater use of forestry credits to meet the EU＊s climate goal.※Relying on credits from planting trees is troublesome as the carbon removals can be reversed at any time when trees are cleared and burned,§ the report says. ※Emissions from fossil fuels, on the other hand, stay in the atmosphere for centuries.§Other ※loopholes§ identified in the paper include a handout of 100m surplus ETS allowances, worth an expected 2bn, to nine countries to help them meet their emissions obligations on paper.When these were taken into account, only Sweden＊s record was judged compatible with the Paris goals.Carlos Calvo Ambel, a spokesperson for Transport & Environment, the survey＊s other co-sponsor, said: ※The great majority of countries want to rig the law with loopholes so they can continue business as usual. Either  follows the lead of Sweden, Germany and France, which are going in the right direction, though not far enough, or we should forget about our climate leadership.§An underlying problem confronting EU policy-makers is the  nature of the changes needed to limit global warming to 2C, as agreed at Paris.

"※I see the air is good today,§ says the security guard, as he sips his cup of bright green pea soup. ※I can tell by the flavour.§Staff and visitors here at the central London headquarters of the  (Riba) have been treated to daily free soup from the , a pop-up installation in the lobby that serves colour-coded soup which matches the government＊s  (DAQI). Flavours start with pea soup - green for good air quality, then move to yellow butternut squash or red pepper and chilli as the air gets worse, and an eye-watering purple beetroot and horseradish flavour when the pollution is high. Since its launch last week, the kitchen has given away around 50 cups a day, and so far they＊ve all been green. ※I need to find a way to jazz it up a bit with this good air,§ jokes the chef, Angeletia Clarke. Prize money from a Riba competition enabled seven young architects from Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios to design and build the installation, which aims to bring people together through food and raise awareness of air pollution through the unlikely medium of soup.※People might come to Pea Soup House not knowing much at all about air quality, or just say ＆free soup, brilliant＊ 每 but that for us is a way into a wider discussion,§ says architect Chris Allen. ※The soup means people can connect that day to air quality and start to make those links themselves,§ explains researcher Joe Jack Williams. As well as serving as a soup kitchen, the structure is designed to communicate a whole year＊s worth of air quality data in a way that people can easily see. It＊s clad in brightly coloured horizontal wooden batons that each represent individual days of 2015 air quality readings from Oxford Street, . Small plaques indicate the dates and there are information boards with data and research from .※We had all sorts of great data and research and we were trying to work out how we could represent that through architecture,§ said Allen. ※We had what we felt was a very strong idea 每 linking soup and the daily air quality index 每 but how would that be expressed in architecture? We talked about handing soup out on the street but we decided that actually it needed to be grounded in a place, and feel like it＊s arrived in a community.§Inspiration for the project came from ※pea souper§, the  in 1820 to describe the deadly, thick yellow smogs of London. ※That was the starting point for us when we were thinking about how to engage people,§ said Allen. ※We can make that connection to air quality today and the history about pea soup fog. Britain was the first country in the world to look at air quality and that first step of [the Clean Air Act] in the 1950s is the start of air quality as we know it.§ last year found that nearly 9,500 people in the capital die early annually because of air pollution.

He has also proposed bringing forward an extra charge on the most polluting vehicles to 2017. he would join the  over its failure to tackle the problem.※I think air pollution is an invisible problem and people know it＊s there but they don＊t quite know the root cause, how it occurs or what they can do,§ said Williams. ※I think Pea Soup House is really about building that awareness so people can really start to ask for better air quality and say ＆I saw that the soup is purple today, what＊s causing it, what can I do about it＊?§Pea Soup House is built using low-cost, carbon-neutral materials, wood from sustainable sources, low chemical paint and varnish, no solvent and with recycling and onward use in mind. The plan is to eventually move it to different pollution hotspots and raise awareness in further communities, possibly engaging schoolchildren by repainting the batons according to their local pollution levels.※Now we know it works and we know it＊s really engaging people we can build it somewhere with a bit more visibility,§ said Williams. ※At the moment this is the first step for us, we want to reach out to communities and experts and put what we learn back into planning as an architect and complete that cycle,§ said Allen.The soup comes from , a small family-run catering company that uses organic, seasonal ingredients, some of which comes from local allotments or food that is destined for waste. ※I came up with all the different flavours I could do according to the colour code,§ said Clarke, who is also an architecture student. ※Everything is French-Creole inspired, with my own seasoning and recipes.§ Cathy finishes her cup and heads back to work. ※The soup is delicious,§ she says. ※I＊m quite uncomfortable to say that I＊m looking forward to the air being slightly worse so I can try I a different soup, although I don＊t think that is really what the project＊s aiming for!§"																																																			
"art of the charm of lapwings is that they look silly, a friend says, and I can surmise what she means. It＊s the ridiculous crest, the unnecessary breadth of wing, which gives them so much more aerial lift and loop than they require, and then there＊s the zaniness of their spring display. Nor should we leave out  that pass for song and which remind me of a dog＊s squeaky play bone wheezing in and out of tune as the animal chews.Yet  are too ingrained in a lifetime of memory for me to think them only silly. They are the first sounds I awakened to as a naturalist in Derbyshire, whose nests we came upon in the grass like a revelation, and whose blotched-brown Easter eggs seemed a kind of miracle.Lapwing song was the omnipresent soundtrack of all my childhood springs. Now it has gone from behind our family home, as have 65% of all Britain＊s lapwings since the 1970s. Their inexorable leave-taking has been central, throughout my adult life as an environmentalist, to that wider sense of wildlife loss, . Today as I watch 30 males song-flighting across the river, over the RSPB＊s , I can forget briefly that lapwing is classified as near-threatened with global extinction. Males yo-yo everywhere you look, the squeezed-bone song arcing through the milky light of March and filling the whole valley with joy. Funny, really, to imagine, since all that lapwings are is processed invertebrates, that this whole thing 每 the wing-thrum, the creaking cries, the blazing black-and-white rhyming of their wings - is just soil turned to song and dance.I forget in which book, but the author WH Hudson suggests that beauty in nature is more important than beauty in art because, while we can go on filling galleries and museums with our works, once the life has gone from a place or species it is gone forever. All I know is that, as I get older, I know with increased certainty that no book or even music triggers the same perennial flower of feeling as lapwings in display.

"It has inspired astronomers, artists, musicians and poets but the Milky Way could become a distant memory for much of humanity, a new global atlas of light pollution suggests.The study reveals that 60% of Europeans and almost 80% of North Americans cannot see the glowing band of our galaxy because of the effects of artificial lighting, while it is imperceptible to the entire populations of Singapore, Kuwait and Malta. Overall, the Milky Way is no longer visible to more than one third of the world＊s population. Lead author Fabio Falchi from the Light  Science and Technology Institute in Italy said the situation was a ※cultural loss of unprecedented magnitude.§Chris Elvidge of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a co-author of the study, added that the times he has seen the Milky Way have been magical experiences. ※Through our technology we＊ve cut off that possibility for large numbers of people for multiple generations now,§ he said. ※We＊ve lost something - but how do we place value on it?§Described by  as ※a broad and ample road whose dust is gold, and pavement stars,§ the Milky Way is so obscured by the effects of modern lighting that it is no longer visible to 77% of the UK population, with the galaxy masked from view across nearly 14% of the country, including regions stretching from London to Liverpool and Leeds. Further afield, areas around the cities of Hong Kong, Beijing and a large stretch of the East Coast of America are among those where a glimpse of the galactic band is out of the question - a situation also found across much of Qatar, the Netherlands and Israel. In Belgium, it cannot be seen in 51% of the country.※Humanity has enveloped our planet in a luminous fog that prevents most of Earth＊s population from having the opportunity to observe our galaxy,§ the authors write.Published in the journal  by an international team of scientists, the research is based on data collected from space by the , together with computer models of sky luminescence and professional and citizen science measurements of sky brightness taken from the ground. The resulting global atlas reveals that large swaths of humanity experience light pollution, including more than 99% of people living in the US and the European Union. People living near Paris would have to travel 900km to areas as such central Scotland, Corsica or central Spain to find a region with night skies almost unpolluted by light, the authors add. By contrast, Central African Republic and Madagascar are among the countries least affected by light pollution, with nearly the entirety of Greenland boasting pristine skies. ※Until the advent of night-time lighting became really prominent in the 19th and 20th centuries, everybody would have been familiar with the Milky Way,§ said Marek Kukula, public astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, who was not involved in the study. ※We see it in mythology about the sky, in all cultures around the world. It is one of the obvious components of the sky along with the stars, the planets and the moon.§When light from our streetlamps, homes and illuminations is thrown up into the sky it bounces off particles and moisture droplets in the atmosphere and is scattered, resulting in artificial ※sky glow§ - one of the key factors contributing to light pollution. The upshot is that spectacles like the Milky Way can become obscured from view.※The night sky is part of our natural heritage. It is beautiful, it is awe-inspiring and being able to see it is a way for us to connect to the wider universe and understand our place in the natural world,§ said Kukula. §If we lose that it is a shame because we have lost that direct connection with something much bigger than us and something that is very beautiful.§The situation could become worse. According to the new study, if all sodium lights are replaced with cool white LED lighting, artificial sky brightness seen across Europe could more than double as a result of the increase in blue-light emission. And it isn＊t only our view of the night sky that is affected by light pollution. ※There are also , not only on birds and insects and , but also even on humans,§ said Elvidge, pointing out that the light pollution can disrupt the natural behaviour of animals and has raised a number of .It isn＊t all doom and gloom. Despite the Milky Way being masked from view in many cities across the UK there are still regions of the country where it is possible to get a good view of the night sky. ※There are various dark sky parks and reserves in the UK which have been internationally certified by the  to have low levels of light pollution - places like Galloway Forest Park,§ said Kukula, adding that various  can help to direct stargazers to the right part of the sky.But the authors of the new study say more needs to be done to tackle the issue of light pollution. Among possible measures, says Elvidge, are the use of more shielded street lighting, motion-activated lights and cut-off times for illuminating buildings. Kukula agrees, ※It will reduce our electricity bills, it will reduce our carbon footprint, it won＊t affect the lighting that we have on the streets,§ he said. ※And it will allow us to see more of the wonders of the night sky.§We are here on planet Earth but we live in a huge cosmos, and its one of the things that links us to our position in the universe. And so it is wonderful to see it. I think by looking up at the stars we have endeavoured to do so many things, we＊ve sent probes to Pluto and beyond, and if we lose contact with that I think we lose some of our ability to dream and to aspire. It starts with the Milky Way but where will it end? I spent a wonderful six months working at a telescope in Chile, at the Gemini telescope, and there we could actually see [the Milky Way] - it did look like a path across the sky. It has inspired songs, it has inspired people to great endeavours and so I think the more light pollution there is the more we miss out on that, and the generations to come will never see that beauty.For me the Milky Way has been an unfailing source of inspiration and wonder, as basic component of my identity as the fact that I live on Earth in our Solar System.I have been a passionate evangelist for the galaxy, and am perhaps more inspired by the Milky Way than any artist who has ever lived.I deplore the barriers we have erected that block the view for most of Earth＊s people. Nothing can clear the mind, elevate the soul, or inspire curiosity more than the Milky Way.The night sky is the most universally-shared part of our environment. It＊s been gazed and wondered at, throughout history, by people in all parts of the world. It＊s indeed a sad deprivation that many young people have never seen a clear starry sky. And it＊s important that it＊s not just astronomers who care about this.I＊m not an ornithologist, but I＊d feel deprived if songbirds disappeared from my garden. Likewise, there would surely be widespread sadness if light pollution screened out our celestial environment from ever more of us.The Milky Way is our link to the Other: to the lost civilisations out there in the galaxy, so far away and so profligate that they appear not as stars, but as a single brush stroke of watery light. When we lose the Milky Way, we sever the umbilical cord that connects us to the wider universe.It＊s not just the Milky Way [people] can＊t see. Who in the 21st Century has ever seen the Zodiacal Light - that beautiful cone of dusty light that can even outshine the Milky Way, a thrill to see if you are lucky enough to have dark skies where you live. And probably about 10,000 stars that the three Wise Men on their way to Bethlehem would have been able to see are all invisible to us in the cities, where we are swamped by mainly unnecessary stray light. From my roof in Kensington on a clear night I can see roughly 30 stars - it＊s a tragedy, really. Along with all the other excesses of what we call civilisation, our first-hand awareness of the cosmos has been forgotten. We are so fortunate to be living on a planet that gives us a view, not only of our own Solar System companions: the planets, comets, etc - but also of countless stars in our own Milky Way Galaxy. Because of this we＊ve been able make the foundations of cosmology, discovering the very nature of the vast universe around us. From our position out on a spiral arm of the Galaxy, we see both inwards towards the centre of the Galaxy and outwards towards its edge. The billions of stars in the Galactic plane show up as a milky light which has enchanted people from the dawn of history. But we, in our ceaseless dash to make money and cover the world with concrete, have lost this priceless treasure. Along with almost all our wildlife, our contact with Nature, and our humanity.The Milky Way evokes a feeling of awe when I see it. It always has and it always will. This is partly because it is rare to see now due to light pollution. It＊s analogous to spotting a rare bird in your back garden. But I have many memories of seeing this band of hazy light from the dark skies of my village when I was younger. To be able to see the collective light from the stars making up our own galaxy gives a tantalising sense of the enormity of our universe and the structures within it. That so few people are now able to see now the Milky Way is a great loss. We are forcing ourselves to look inward and not outward. And just as we bemoan the loss of our countryside we should act to protect our ability to enjoy the universe. If we don＊t, its inspirational value will be untapped and a site of scientific interest will be rendered accessible only using professional telescopes on mountains or on spacecraft."																																																			
"K scientists are warning they may be unable to carry out crucial research on climate change if  cuts climate science funding in the US.Trump tweeted in 2014 that research on global warming is  that ※has to stop§. Scientists are braced to find out whether his administration will put these words into practice. The early signs are not good. Last month , one of the US Environmental Protection Agency＊s fiercest critics, was named as its new head. There are rumours that the budget of its office for research could be cut by  as part of .Meanwhile there are reports that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of America＊s leading climate science agencies,  by nearly 20%. The agency＊s , a vital source of data for climate research, is expected to bear the brunt of cuts.British scientists say moves to squeeze funding of climate-related research in the US 每 and of facilities at government laboratories in particular 每 could be disastrous for work in the UK. And they say  is already harming their collaboration with scientists in America, with some researchers pulling out of commitments in the UK because of fears they may not make it back through US visa controls.Prof Joanna Haigh, co-director of the  at Imperial College London, says: ※Everything we do is international, and we particularly rely on American satellite data. Perhaps we could manage if other areas were cut 每 perhaps the Chinese or the Indians might even step in to fill the gaps 每 but we would definitely miss the satellite data from the US.§Haigh uses satellite data to study how the sun influences the Earth＊s climate. She is helping to disentangle the effect of natural fluctuations in solar energy from those of manmade greenhouse gases 每 and she is clear that global warming cannot be attributed to the sun or other natural processes.※At Imperial we use NOAA satellite data for many important climate studies. For example, it can tell us how much of the sun＊s energy the Earth absorbs, how much heat energy it emits and how these values depend on other factors, particularly cloud cover.§She says cutting the NOAA＊s budget would be a ※huge hit§ not only for science, but also for our understanding of the weather. ※They are trying to get rid of everything that could be badged as climate change. But to understand the climate you need to measure the weather. You can＊t separate the two. Whether you are on a climate change ＆bandwagon＊ is irrelevant.§Prof Piers Forster, director of the  at Leeds University, says: ※If organisations like Nasa and the NOAA are prohibited from putting up new satellites, that could be really detrimental for the entire international science community. We urgently need these data sets to be able to monitor and understand climate change.§Like many scientists Forster fears a cull across a number of US government laboratories concerned with climate change. ※Our one biggest concern is the loss of raw talent,§ he says. ※The loss of people we collaborate with and the people producing this data that we rely on.§He says the Trump administration is already making scientific collaboration across the Atlantic more difficult. ※Quite a lot of the academics we work with in America are immigrants and some of them are concerned about leaving the country in case they don＊t get back in. We＊ve certainly seen instances where people have pulled out of coming to scientific conferences. Four or five people I know of, speakers and so forth, have pulled out of their commitments to come here.§In a recent example a key scientist from Princeton University pulled out of a climate change workshop that Forster co-organised at Imperial College London.American research fellow Dr Sarah Batterman moved to Leeds University to work on tropical forests and climate change a year ago after doing postdoctoral research at Princeton. She is in regular contact with colleagues in the US and says: ※The situation for people doing climate-related science in the US is really scary. There is so much uncertainty. I think people are trying to keep their heads down and keep their research going as much as they can until they see what is going to happen.§Batterman works closely with scientists at the , a US government laboratory in Panama, and is concerned about whether its funding will continue. ※My research wouldn＊t be possible without the Smithsonian facilities. So for me this isn＊t just something that is happening at a distance,§ she explains.For Prof Rosalind Cornforth, director of the  at Reading University, the anxiety about the US pulling the plug on climate science is somewhat different. Her institute works with governments and scientists in some of the world＊s most fragile, conflict-affected countries, applying climate science to solve real-world problems.※So many of our fellow climate scientists from developing countries rely on access to climate data sets available in the US,§ she says. ※If these become restricted in the future, there would be repercussions on vital capacity development for places like Africa.§There is one potential silver lining for UK universities in this cloud of uncertainty. Vice-chancellors at some leading universities said last week they hoped to be able to woo some big-name climate scientists from across the Atlantic.Forster, whose institute is only a year old and is recruiting staff, says: ※I have just got back from a trip to America to talk to people. Many scientists think it is too early to leave. They don＊t know quite what Trump will do, and there is even some optimism that perhaps he won＊t survive a four-year term. But they are definitely interested in talking to us about possibilities.§Prof Paul Ekins, director of University College London＊s , says many climate scientists may feel forced to leave the US if conditions worsen. ※If you are in a science field that depends on expensive equipment, like climate science research from space, and you can＊t get that kit because the funding dries up, you can＊t do anything. This is applied, practical work trying to understand what is happening to the climate. US scientists may well hope that things will change with the future administration, but they may not want to write off four to eight years of their productive lives.§However, some climate scientists point out that with  Britain may struggle to present itself as a place of calm and stability from which to escape Trump. Batterman says: ※I think early career researchers who are looking for jobs may be considering options abroad. But there is also a lot of uncertainty in the UK too, because we don＊t know what is going to happen with funding after the UK leaves the EU.§"																																																			
																																																			
"One of the justifications for  is the use of natural gas as a bridging fuel between coal and a low-carbon future. However natural gas is mostly , which has strong global warming impacts in its own right. Natural gas therefore only provides climate benefits over coal if the leakage is no more than 2-3%.We cannot measure leaks from every pipe joint. One alternative is to measure the sum of lots of leaks from a distance. Flights over US shale gas fields reveal large methane sources, but these areas also have cattle farms that produce methane and the two sources need to be separated.  also contains ethane, which does not come from farming. Looking at ethane and methane together, shale gas and oil extraction were found to be easily the dominant source giving  of 0.18-2.8% even before the gas was distributed to users.

"oger Page purchased his home in East Bilney, a Norfolk farming community, about 25 years ago. For the better part of those 25 years, he bore no ill will toward the moles. He was fond of wildlife, or at least what little of it remained in the country. A family of deer foraged in the backyard. Foxes lolled in the road at dusk. Moles were a rarity.Page worked as a commercial pilot and when the occasional molehill erupted on his lawn, he would pat it down before departing again to New York or Hong Kong. They seemed to have an understanding, he and the moles. They mostly kept to the woods, while Page mostly kept to the garden.But after he retired five years ago, Page expanded his back lawn and the moles became more persistent. As more and more molehills sprung up, Page came to feel as if their labours were engineered to produce in him the maximum anguish. He purchased traps at the garden centre, but they would often remain unsprung or 每 worse 每 sprung and empty.He decided to escalate his counter-assault. During a stopover in Amsterdam, he bought a pungent bag of flower bulbs advertised as a natural mole deterrent. (The moles didn＊t mind.) Next, he installed a solar-powered mole repeller, a torpedo-shaped device that emits vibrations that are supposed to keep the moles away. (The moles carried on.) He tried flooding them out with a water hose. (Moles are strong swimmers.) Finally, he tried suffocating them with the exhaust of his lawnmower. (Moles can survive in low?oxygen environments.)Page knew it wasn＊t healthy to go on like this. Last September, he found the phone number of a woman named Louise Chapman, also known as the Lady Mole Catcher of Norwich. Traditional mole catching in Britain has experienced a resurgence following a 2006 European Union ban on strychnine, and Chapman is one of many trying to profit from the boom. A former drama teacher, she has been profiled in national newspapers and travelled to Australia in 2016 to be featured in the first season of a reality television show called Deadliest Pests Down Under, where she applied pink lipstick before hunting a funnel web spider. With the help of a business coach, she has also tried marketing Country Mole Catcher? franchises across the country, offering newcomers to the business everything they need to get started for ?7,500, plus a cut of their proceeds.Chapman is a compact blonde woman, and 每 when she＊s on the job 每 clad in Wellington boots. When we arrived at Page＊s home, she popped open the back of her white Audi estate car and retrieved a bucket containing plastic flags, a garden spade and a long metal rod with a bulb on the end 每 a mole probe.We followed Page to the side of his house. There, a ragged strip of lawn about the size of a tennis court lay dotted with patches of overturned earth, each patch spaced every two feet or so. The lawn looked as though it had been strafed by artillery. Chapman walked the length of it, taking note of small details: a crack in the soil, a dead patch of grass, a pile of fresh dirt. She saw herself as an archaeologist who could reconstruct the workings of an underground metropolis based on the scantest traces on the surface.※I reckon there are three,§ Chapman said at last. She gave Page a quote for the work: ?80 for the first mole with the price dropping to ?60 a mole for two or more. She couldn＊t promise to dispatch them on the first visit or even the second one. It could take weeks, but he didn＊t have to pay a penny if she wasn＊t successful. ※No mole, no fee,§ they call it in the business. ※You＊ve already tried to catch them, and they might have got wily,§ she warned.Clients are sometimes taken aback by Chapman＊s prices, which she makes a point of delivering in person. Page, however, readily agreed that it was worth it for his sanity, and Chapman got to work. She began by cutting a cube of turf from the roof of the mole run and carefully set it on the ground. Then, she inserted a trap shaped like a fizzy drink can into the hole and covered it with a few clumps of grass. This trap, known as the  and first patented in 1920, is based on traditional designs made of a clay or wooden barrel and a horsehair snare powered by a bent stick. In the modern metal trap, a spring-loaded wire loop functions as the snare. When the mole enters the device, it makes it halfway through this loop before brushing against the trigger. The wire loop then accelerates upward, crushing the mole against the trap＊s curved roof.Page was clearly torn between his desire to have an attractive lawn and the violent death he was about to sanction. ※I don＊t like killing animals,§ he said. Chapman, on her hands and knees, looked up from her work. ※You were driven to it,§ she told him. When she had finished setting traps, she said that either she or her colleague Carole would return ※in a few days§.Chapman tossed off those last words casually, but they represented one of the most divisive issues in mole catching today. Unlike mousetraps, mole traps do not kill instantly and do not always kill cleanly. The  is bitterly divided between those who believe that traps should be checked every 24 hours 每 to ensure that any injured moles are dispatched quickly, rather than being left to die a slow and agonising death 每 and those who don＊t.Because of the expense of driving out to check an empty trap day after day, opponents of such regulations argue that it would hasten the extinction of mole catching as it has been practised for centuries. ※It will criminalise all the mole-catchers,§ Chapman says. Britain would be overrun by molehills, which are not only unsightly, but can also potentially spread disease to livestock, trip up horses on race-courses, and ruin golf courses and football pitches. To professionals such as Chapman, such threats appear to outweigh the possibility that a maimed mole or an unfortunate weasel could be squirming in pain beneath someone＊s lawn for days.he idea of a professional who specialises in mole control can seem like a quaint relic from the past. In the 18th century mole-catchers were employed by every parish in England to keep the mole population under control. Catching these creatures required such skill that practitioners were remunerated more generously than surgeons. Mole-catchers zealously guarded their methods, divulging them only to their own children.The earliest English descriptions of mole catching practically take the form of spells. Roger Sharrock, in 1660, advised his readers to cut up red herrings, burn them, and place the pieces in the mouths of molehills. In a pinch, garlic or leeks might also work. ※I have not tryed these ways,§ Sharrock added, ※and therefore refer the Reader to his own tryal, belief or doubt.§For a mole-catcher to be successful today, he or she must engage the client with the most romantic notions of his profession. This, at least, is the theory of Duncan Emmett, a mole-catcher in his 60s who has the long beard of a wizard. ※If you take that magic away, if you take that showmanship away, then all you are left with is the killing,§ Emmett told me at a dimly lit pub near his home in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire. ※Because you have to kill the mole, haven＊t you? That isn＊t an easy thing for a lot of people to bear.§Even in agricultural settings, mole catching still takes the form of an annual rite. Outside the town of Ludlow, near the Welsh border, I visited a sheep paddock where 40 or 50 dead moles had hung from a barbed-wire fence for so many years that their desiccated bodies had turned greenish from lichen. It looked like a ceremonial sacrifice. Although the practice is fading, mole-catchers employ such gibbets to prove that the promised work is completed, and farmers use them to niggle their neighbours into clearing their own fields.The word ※mole§ is thought to derive from the middle English word , which literally means earth-thrower. The animals＊ forelimbs are cartoonishly large, pink and practically hairless, and, apart from an extra digit, have the appearance of a doll＊s hands. So prized were moles＊ hands that farmers once kept them in silk bags as talismans for good luck and to ward off toothache, epilepsy and scrofula.Moles dig their tunnel systems to catch earthworms, shoving the excavated earth out of vertical passageways to produce molehills. In a 1976 study, researchers counted 7,380 molehills on a single hectare of English pasture, estimating their total weight to be 64,500kg. Sheep that eat dirt from molehills can die from listeriosis, while winter feed for dairy cattle can become foul-tasting or toxic if contaminated by soil bacteria.Moles can be detrimental in other ways as well. Nearly every British mole-catcher can tell you the story of King William III. On 21 February 1702, he was riding his horse at Hampton Court when it tripped on a molehill and threw him to the ground. He broke his collarbone and developed pneumonia, which killed him two weeks later. (His enemies in Scotland are said to have raised toasts to ※the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat§.)Mole control became a national policy in 1566, when a bitter cold period known as the Little Ice Age threatened England＊s food supply. Queen Elizabeth passed ※An Acte for the Preservation of Grayne§, which would remain in force for the next three centuries. The law prescribed bounties to be paid for the destruction of a long and dubious list of agricultural vermin, including everything from hedgehogs to kingfishers. Some parishes paid out a half-penny per mole, others appointed mole-catchers with contracts lasting up to 21 years. In addition to their salaries, mole-catchers sold the silky mole skins, which were prized for the tailoring of waistcoats.In the early 20th century, worms dipped in strychnine became the preferred method for controlling moles on farms. The poison blocks nerve receptors along the spinal cord, causing the victim to become frantic and hyper-stimulated. Their body is overcome by painful convulsions which lead to a backward arching of the head, neck, and spine, a state known as opisthotonus. And because strychnine doesn＊t break down in animal tissue, it can also ripple through the food chain when a bird of prey or even a domestic dog consumes a poisoned mouse or mole.In 1963, when the House of Commons was debating a bill to ban the poison, David Renton, the minister of state for the Home Office, testified that moles ※strangely enough§ failed to show ※the same symptoms of pain§ as other animals. In the end, the law banned strychnine for mice and rats, but exempted moles because no ready substitute existed. In the following decades, British farmers purchased more than 50kg of strychnine each year 每 enough, in theory, to kill half a billion moles. (The entire mole population in Great Britain has been estimated at 31 million.)The poison was only phased out with the European Union＊s new pesticide regulations in 2006, which led British newspapers to make grave predictions of a mole explosion. At the same time, the regulation led to the rise of the modern mole-catcher, drawing in dreamers who wanted to make a living from this unusual business.When Louise Chapman first started trapping moles in 2014, she joined an organisation named the Guild of British Molecatchers and took a class with its founder, Jeff Nicholls, who is considered a leading authority on the topic. The Guild, which was founded in 2008, is one of three mole-catching organisations in the country and has about 150 dues-paying members, along with 200 registered supporters.Unlike the British Mole Catchers Register and the Association of Professional Mole Catchers, the Guild has strict rules about checking traps daily. A letter that the Guild sent out to members in 2009 explained that daily trap checking was ※gaining a strong momentum from numerous sources§ and the Guild had adopted ※a self-regulating stance before it is dictated to us by some bureaucratic directive in Brussels§.Chapman claims to have known none of this and, one day in October 2014, she was surprised to receive notice that she was being kicked out of the Guild. Its agents had evidently discovered that she was failing to follow its rules. ※I tried being reasonable, and they don＊t want to play like that,§ Chapman told me.Chapman didn＊t just join a competing organisation, she bought up one that already existed. Membership in the British Mole Catchers Register would give mole-catchers credibility and visibility, she promised. At ?75 per year to join, it also costs nearly twice as much as the Guild.hen I first began looking into the Guild of British Mole Catchers, I was surprised to find that Jeff Nicholls＊s name is not included in the list of officers on the website. He had spoken to me briefly by telephone, but later proved difficult to communicate with, responding to my emails erratically and failing to answer my questions directly. He was friendly in a way, but he expressed a fear that I might invalidate his life＊s work. He was, he told me, on the verge of a kind of breakthrough in ensuring higher welfare standards for the mole, and he was concerned about his own safety. ※I＊ve been told to sleep with one eye open because I might smell smoke,§ he told me, referring to an anonymous phone call he had received from a molecatcher who was unhappy with his efforts on behalf of Britain＊s moles. I decided that I had to meet him in person.It had just stopped raining when I arrived at the Royal County of Berkshire Show, held near Reading.The air was heavy with the scent of wet grass and animal manure. After circling the grounds, I finally found what I was looking for: a makeshift arena decorated like a Smurf village with artificial flowers, cartoon backdrops, and two wooden chests with signs warning: ※Danger Keep your Distance§. A stout man with a rosy complexion popped out from a tent behind the stage. Nicholls had a red scarf around his neck, a canvas hat on his head, and a headset microphone bent in front of his mouth. ※Ladies and gentlemen,§ he announced, ※I＊m a professional grass shark hunter.§ With that, the show began.On stage, Nicholls directed his wife to remove the chains from a number of boxes, and warned onlookers to run in the other direction should he drop them. He cracked the lid of one of the boxes and produced a 3ft-tall mole puppet he had had custom made in California. It was named Freckles. Over the course of the half-hour show, as Nicholls delved into the mole＊s life and habits, his style shifted from corny to educational and back again. ※Do moles smell?§ he asked. ※If you leave them in the back of the car, they do.§After the show, I introduced myself and Nicholls eyed me suspiciously. He warmed a little as his passion bubbled up and he offered me a cheese and onion sandwich from his cool box. ※I just want to fight for the moles, who have had such a bad deal for so many years,§ he said.Nicholls has been catching moles since he was a boy, when he had to make his own traps, and all those years of killing had not numbed him to the plight of his prey. It had only furthered his certainty that they deserve better. What he wanted was a simple thing. The government currently recommends that mole-catchers check their traps daily to ensure that moles are not suffering unduly. Nicholls would like that rule change to be mandatory.※I say to my boys 每 my youngest is 26 每 when you leave this planet, you must leave something behind or there＊s no point in being. Either a book or a song or a sculpture,§ Nicholls said. ※My path is moles. I must do something for them, get this welfare for them before I leave this planet.§here is something jarring about the idea of a humane kill, as though the fact of taking a life can be mitigated by minimising the pain inflicted during death. Most authorities agree that what is known as the ※time to irreversible unconsciousness§ is the relevant variable in determining how humane a kill-trap is. Whereas a standard mouse trap will dispatch the animal instantly by snapping the spine from above, the Duffus style of mole trap applies its blow to the chest, with less predictable results.The shortcomings of the Duffus trap have been known for a long time. In 1951, a committee reporting to the British legislature on animal cruelty wrote that ※the spring of the ordinary type of mole-trap was too weak to kill instantaneously§. More recently, a 2004 report on mole control by the Department of Environment Farming and Rural Agriculture (Defra) concluded that, ※The performance of existing kill-traps (or the way they are used) is questionable as a more humane alternative to the use of strychnine.§I saw the brutality of the Duffus trap with my own eyes when I rode around with a mole-catcher named John Noblett, whose work largely comes from dairy farms in Lancashire. Noblett is the embodiment of the 21st-century mole-catcher, a straight-shooter with no time for the theatre of some of his colleagues. He sometimes bags more than 6,000 moles per year, and he sets so many traps that he has a GPS mounted on his quad bike to pinpoint their location. He has earned the title ※Master Mole Catcher§ from the Guild and wants nothing more than a clean, humane kill.When he pulled one freshly-laid trap from the ground, the mole inside was still alive with the thin belt of metal cinched around its waist. All four of its feet were waving around in sad circles. Noblett whipped the animal against a metal box on the back of the idling quad, and the life went out of it. He set the limp creature down on its side. A perfect sphere of blood bubbled up out of its ear.Nicholls, as part of a lobbying effort, has amassed a dossier of suffering, collating his own disturbing accounts and testimonies from like-minded colleagues such as Noblett. The 37-page report, which Nicholls shared with me, contains a photograph of a mole caught by just one paw. Another, by its snout. According to Nicholls, other styles of traps, including the popular scissors trap, are generally less humane than the Duffus. In the report, Nicholls describes how he has spent years setting traps and waiting for them to trigger, so that he could closely monitor their efficacy. ※It was a long process and worth every hour,§ he writes. What he witnessed confirmed all his worst suspicions about the cruelty of his beloved profession. Never once did he witness a mole receive a fatal strike. Quite regularly, he saw moles struck below their bellies struggling for more than five minutes as their bodies filled with blood. ※I was in fact allowing moles to suffer in the traps I set 每 this undetected misery was in my hands and was and is totally unnecessary suffering.§The observations led Nicholls, in 2008, to design a modifed Duffus trap for Procter Brothers, a Welsh company founded in 1740. This trap, which has a stronger spring to make it a more efficient killing machine, is widely available, but there is no legal requirement to use it over other trap styles.Under the Pests Act of 1954, trappers can only use approved traps to kill stoats, weasels, rabbits, and squirrels and they must be checked at least once per day. Nicholls cannot understand why moles and rodents do not merit the same protection. Several years ago, a European Union study on trapping vindicated Nicholls＊ views, concluding that ※there is no scientific justification for not including all species§ in trapping regulations and that kill traps ※should be inspected once every 24 hours§. While some may think live trapping moles offers a humane alternative, a wet mole in a cold plastic tube can quickly succumb to starvation or hypothermia. (There is also the question of where to release them. Because moles are highly territorial, if they are released in a neighboring territory, they will potentially tear each other to pieces.)Nicholls is tight-lipped about his government contacts, but he has had the ear of politicians such as Chris Davies, a Liberal Democrat and former member of the European parliament, who previously came out in support of the strychnine ban. Bernard Donoughue, the Labour peer and former minister for Farming and the Food Industry, was once listed on the Guild＊s website as a ※patron§. In the last year, Nicholls claims he has got his report in the hands of someone ※as high as you can go§ at Defra, which has the power to set trapping regulations.One reason that Nicholls is so careful not to reveal too much about his political contacts is that at every opportunity he has had to advance his cause, he has been foiled by his nemesis, Duncan Emmett. In 2008, Emmett cofounded the Association of Professional Mole Catchers, as a counterweight to the Guild of British Mole Catchers. When Nicholls tried to get the Guild＊s code of practice endorsed by an umbrella organisation of British pest controllers, Emmett rallied his own members to halt it. When Emmett heard that Nicholls was trying to get new rules passed in Scotland, he filed freedom of information requests with the government so that he could challenge it. (Emmett declined to share the information he obtained from these requests.)When I spoke with Emmett, he told me that daily trap-checking would be devastating to his members because of the potential cost and time required to drive out to the same yard again and again. Nor did Emmett believe that such rules would achieve any measurable advancement in mole welfare. Why not check traps twice a day as they do in Sweden? Or every four hours? Or five minutes?Despite putting up a good fight, Emmett admitted that a rule change is inevitable. The public concern over animal welfare will, he believes, be decisive. ※He [Nicholls] will pull it off in the end,§ Emmett said. ※People don＊t want a mole in their garden, but they don＊t necessarily want to see it cut in half and displayed on their gate.§n an era when farmers and foodies alike have embraced the idea of sustainability, a call to a pest controller, with their traps and chemicals, feels like a sin. The central dilemma of the modern mole-catcher is to demonstrate that not only are their services ethically sound but that they are also valuable and necessary. Some scientists believe this may not be an easy task.On a blustery Sunday morning, I met Rob Atkinson near his home in Ludlow. Atkinson is the former chief scientist for the RSPCA and author of the natural history book The Mole. Although he corresponded with Nicholls while at the RSPCA and has supported research on mole traps, he came to realise that they had different goals. For Atkinson, it wasn＊t enough to find nicer ways to kill moles 每 he didn＊t want them to be killed at all.Atkinson is a soft-spoken, thoughtful man who has wavy grey hair and a downy white beard, and I couldn＊t imagine him harming a single creature. He admitted to me, however, that he was once tasked with clearing moles out of his parents＊ garden. He still remembers the excitement he felt when he would see a sprung trap. But, he added, ※even, then, there was this sadness§. The landscape, once dynamic and alive, soon grew still. The rain washed over the molehills and they gradually flattened out. ※You＊ve done what you intended to do, but there＊s a feeling that something is gone that was once here,§ he said. Moles are in no danger of becoming extinct, but they are a reminder of Britain＊s ancient natural history. Unlike other species, such as the grey squirrel, which were introduced by humans in recent centuries, the resident mole has lived in Britain for more than 350,000 years.In the late 1980s, Atkinson studied the lives of moles while working on his master＊s degree at the University of Oxford. He interviewed farmers about their impact, and tracked the movements of moles in the field. He came to the conclusion that mole catching was, for the most part, useless 每 a practice that should have died out years ago. In fact, scientists believe that moles benefit vegetable crops by turning the soil and eating pests. Overall, the annual cost of moles to the ?25bn British agriculture industry has been estimated at less than ?5m. ※If you don＊t like them on your lawn, does that give you a reason to kill them?§ Atkinson asked me.He told me about one particular moment that had stayed with him from his research around Oxford. It was summer and dry weather had driven the moles so deep underground that he rarely saw much activity on the surface. Then, one evening at dusk, Atkinson was walking through a field when he heard a noise like crinkling paper. It was the sound of grass roots snapping. The ground rose up, creased and fissured. Earthworms fled to the surface.The earth split open. Atkinson spotted a mole＊s snout poking through the soil, periscope-like. He fell to the ground and dangled a live worm. The mole snatched it between its jaws. It didn＊t swallow the worm immediately. Instead, it ran its claws along the length of the worm, sloughing the unwanted dirt from inside the translucent body like small pink fingers squeezing a tube of toothpaste. It was one of the most magnificent things that Atkinson had ever witnessed. Next thing he knew, the mole had gobbled up the worm and disappeared.

"Bumblebees can learn how to manoeuvre a ball just by watching others carry out the task, researchers have discovered in the latest study to shed light on the insects＊ surprising talents.While bees have already been shown to be able to learn how to pull on strings, push caps and even rotate a lever to access food, researchers say the new study shows that bees are better at problem solving than we thought.※Previous [research] has found that bumblebees can do complex tasks but those tasks have always been really close to natural behaviour,§ said Olli Loukola, first author of the research from Queen Mary University of London, pointing out that bees often have to manipulate different parts of a flower to access nectar. ※Now we have shown that they can learn something that is totally unnatural, like moving balls.§In the first part of the study, published in the journal , bees were presented with a platform, a yellow ball and a target area containing a concealed reservoir of sucrose. The bees were repeatedly shown how to manoeuvre the ball over the target area to gain access to the sweet treat by means of fake bee on a stick. They were then tested on their abilities. While 10 bees who were not shown a demonstration almost never managed to succeed in the task, the nine that were all succeeded. What＊s more, they improved over test trials, taking less time and shorter paths.The second experiment involved a platform on which rested three balls at various distances from the centre.  were then presented with one of three different training scenarios: a trained bee that moved the furthest ball to the centre, a magnet that could move the furthest ball to the centre, or no training where just one ball was presented and placed in the centre of the platform. The bees were then tested to see if they could accomplish the task of moving one of three balls to the centre to receive a drop of sugar solution.The results reveal that the bees were on average more successful when trained by other bees than with the magnet and that both were more effective than no training, with success rates of around 99%, 78% and 34% respectively. Intriguingly, unlike the demonstrations, the bees generally chose to move the ball closest to the centre, a result that held even when that ball was black rather than yellow.※This means that the bees didn＊t just simply copy the demonstrator and could improve upon the demonstrator＊s technique or strategy,§ said Loukola. ※The fact that they saw the task in different ways than the demonstrator shows a very impressive amount of cognitive flexibility.§ Paul Graham, an expert in insect navigation from the University of Sussex who was not involved in the research, described the findings as a beautiful example of animal behaviour, but added that it was not clear whether the bees chose the closest ball due to strategic planning or for other reasons. Nevertheless, says Graham, the study emphasises that bees are adapted to persevere when it comes to accessing food. ※[It] is further evidence of social learning and the fact that bees can learn to associate certain actions with reward 每 both of which reinforce the view that these are smart critters,§ he said.

"y lunchtime the skies over rural Bedfordshire had become an arrivals and departures board. Thin white slashes criss-crossing the blue trailed over the horizon towards Barcelona, Rome and Salzburg. The 11.25 to Katowice had dissipated into a wispy smudge. Then, an intense arrowhead, like a cursor on a computer screen, might have been the 12.20 from Barcelona entering our airspace.Birds of prey do not arrive; they simply appear in the sky, as if they had been lowered from heaven. So it was that three  came into view out of nowhere.Other raptors soar and soar in sunshine, but there was no risk of these birds vanishing into specks of oblivion. Kites are low gliders, pegged to the earth by invisible strings. Their wings are sails, and the .Someone had lit a fire in the pony paddocks below the trio, and smoke spewed out to the west. The birds rose above the billowing mass, enjoying the easterlies, fingering the breeze with their wingtips.It soon became apparent, however, that this was not a harmonious threesome but a pair and a spare. Three times the one on the right challenged the middle one by flying up to it. Each time, a dismissive turn of the head and a clench of talons was enough to fend it off.After the third tussle, it seemed the middle kite had had enough. It veered away and mounted the sky before freezing in the air, wings and tail flat and still, until the wind pulled it directly above its rival. In an instant, its wings folded back and it went into a stooping dive. The bird beneath craned its neck to see its assailant, tipped its beak, raised its shoulder and a crumpled wing, then fell into a tumbling tailspin.The beaten kite flew lower, the victorious one climbed higher. Once more, the victor attacked from above and then a third time, until its opponent dropped so low it was grounded. One bird sat in the stubble, the other flew to join its mate."																																																			
"The EU is set to ban raw ivory exports from 1 July as it struggles to deal with what was almost certainly another record year of ivory seizures across the continent in 2016. sells more raw and carved ivory to the world than anywhere else, feeding a seemingly insatiable appetite for elephant tusks in China and east Asia.Although the international ivory trade has been largely banned since 1990, European vendors are legally allowed to export ivory ※harvested§ before that date, whether raw 每 whole tusks, ivory chunks or scraps 每 or worked by carving, polishing or engraving.Traffickers can infiltrate this legal market by, for example,  to pass their poached ivory off as lawful produce. These papers may serve as the basis for re-export certificate applications from Europe to east Asian countries, particularly China and Hong Kong. But a draft EU guidance document seen by the Guardian indicates a possible 1 July date for an export ban on unprocessed ivory to ※make sure that tusks of legal origin are not mixed with illegal ivory§.Heirlooms, cultural artefacts and scientific and educational specimens would be partly exempted from the EU＊s trade embargo. The sanction would also not affect worked ivory items or the EU＊s internal tusk trade, although rules would be tightened.However, the political signal sent by the export ban was warmly welcomed by campaigners, after similar moves to squeeze the bloody trade in China and the US.  Catherine Bearder, the Liberal Democrat MEP whose wildlife crime report proposing a total ivory ban won overwhelming backing in parliament last year, said: ※Blueprints are only as good as the actions that follow them so I am delighted that the commission is rolling up its sleeves to get on with the job. This really is a hopeful development.§Both 2014 and 2015 saw record spikes in the European ivory trade, with re-export volumes surpassing those of the previous eight years combined.The picture darkened further last year with  in just four large seizures across Europe 每 compared with 554 kilos and 1,043 ivory carvings taken , according to the respected German conservation group, Pro Wildlife. ※2016 has definitely been a record year for ivory seizures in the EU,§ Daniela Freyer, Pro Wildlife＊s co-founder told the Guardian. ※There is also clear evidence of illegal ivory being traded within the EU. The EU needs to take responsibility and finally ban its own ivory trade as well as all exports. Its continued inactivity is threatening to undermine trade bans by other key players such as  and the US.§ The European commission said it was likely that a new record had been set in 2016, and confirmed that a ban on raw ivory exports would be introduced this summer.Its guidance paper, which could change, also instructs EU states to exercise ※maximum scrutiny§ and ※increased vigilance and controls§ when dealing with permitted ivory transactions. A commission spokesperson said: ※As a further step, the Commission is ready to examine the rationale for and possible design of further restrictions on [the] export of worked ivory and intra-EU trade in ivory. This assessment would take place in the second half of 2017.§For conservationists, this holds out the possibility of a comprehensive and watertight EU trade prohibition, as the 29 countries of the African Elephants Coalition  Bearder, a former antiques trader herself, said: ※Until you have a complete ban, you＊re not going to stop the ivory trade. All sorts of ivory is being shipped and sold 每 knife handles, snooker balls 每 so that it can be reworked, and that is creating the market. We will not protect elephants until everyone knows that you cannot trade in ivory.§ High profile hauls in 2016 netted 744 kilos of ivory  last May, 470 kilos in three separate raids in France, and  in Austria＊s history 每 weighing 564 kilos 每 in November. That smuggling ring was reportedly broken up when police found a man trying to sell tusks on the streets of Vienna to a well-known boxer. 1,200 kilos of ivory with a street value of over 1m  from a Vietnamese gang operating close to Berlin＊s Schoenfeld airport and in a workshop in Koblenz last September. The police investigation is still ongoing and senior German officials are not ruling out the possibility that other east Asian crime gangs may still be operating in the country. ※We hope not, but you can never say never,§ Elsa Nickell, the director general of the German environment ministry told the Guardian. ※We were taken by surprise by this big seizure. It was absolutely unexpected and we were lucky with it. But we will be keeping our eyes on this in the future.§ Officials believe that the smugglers based themselves close to the airport to easily launder their contraband, disguise its origins, and evade law enforcement agencies. Frank Barsch, the German government＊s  representative, suggested that the smugglers may also have been anticipating China＊s moves to . ※These workshops were equipped with milling machines and handsaws, suggesting that they were cutting the tusks and ivory pieces into suitable sizes for transport,§ he said. ※But no machines for fine artworking were found, so we believe that the end processing of the ivory was supposed to happen in the destination countries.§ Germany has banned raw ivory exports with dimensions greater than one kilo 每 or 20cm in length 每 since 2014, and is now a leading player in Brussels talks aimed at implementing .※Anything on the market can be used for laundering the illegal stuff,§ Nickell said. ※That＊s why we are trying to get everything off the market, even the pre-[Cites 1990] convention raw and manufactured ivory: to tighten every loophole, and to close the ivory market down.§Conservation groups dispute this. Freyer said: ※The German government presents its position as shutting down all loopholes, but in practice its proposals would leave the door open for trade in worked ivory. The smugglers will walk through this door.§"																																																			
"The diesel-fuelled air pollution crisis should be solved by making motor companies recall and upgrade the dirty cars they sold, experts said on Wednesday. Current UK plans are focused on making diesel drivers pay to enter cities and a possible taxpayer-funded . But both  and  have already required that manufacturers including Volkswagen, Opel, Audi, Mercedes and Renault fix over a million diesel vehicles which were spewing far higher levels of toxic pollution on the road than in official tests. ※The polluter should be paying, not the consumer and not the taxpayer. But the UK is doing nothing,§ said Greg Archer, at NGO Transport & Environment and a former UK government air pollution expert. ※If the car industry was required to recall those vehicles and upgrade the after-treatment system that would make a sizeable difference to the air pollution problems in our cities.§※We wouldn＊t need to pay for a scrappage scheme,§ he added. ※It is time for the [manufacturers] who caused the problem to pay for the problem.§This solution is also backed by ClientEarth, the environmental law firm that has  at the high court over the government＊s . ※The prime minister must get on the side of ordinary car drivers and stand up to the car industry by committing to a programme of mandatory vehicle recall, compensation, random on-road testing and a clean-car label based on real-world emissions,§ said ClientEarth chief executive James Thornton. More than  for compensation VW, following the lack of government action.Air pollution causes 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK and the courts have forced the government to come up with a new plan, which is expected in the next fortnight. The likelihood of charges being levied on diesel drivers entering cities and towns around the country has led to concerns that owners, encouraged by past tax breaks to buy diesel cars, will now be penalised.: ※I＊m very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we＊re looking at what we do in the future.§ However, the government faces difficult choices. ※Toxin charges§ on dirty diesels entering cities, such as the  from October, would be highly effective in cutting pollution but are politically sensitive. A scrappage scheme has significant support but would be expensive for taxpayers and might actually cut very little pollution.※Scrappage schemes don＊t work, because the people that can afford to buy brand new cars are not the ones driving about in [polluting] ones more than 10 years old,§ said Archer. ※Also, we should not be rewarding the car industry by boosting sales.§A scrappage scheme, where owners of older, dirtier diesels would get a few thousand pounds to scrap their car and buy a newer, cleaner one, is supported by the , ,  and motoring organisations.※Whilst it makes sense to steer car owners away from diesel, it currently seems all about putting cost on them rather than accepting some of the financial burden centrally,§ said Steve Nash, CEO of the Institute of the Motor Industry. ※A scrappage scheme, or some other form of incentive to soften the cost of change, would be fairer and help to accelerate the process.§ But other motoring organisations are deeply sceptical, noting that a nationwide scrappage scheme would not target the urban areas where air pollution is a problem and that many polluting diesel cars are relatively new, and so very expensive to scrap.Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation said: ※ shows that it is much easier to call for a diesel scrappage scheme than it is to design one that delivers a good air quality outcome for a sensible cost.§Tamzen Isacsson, at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which represents the UK motor industry said: ※While the SMMT supports fleet renewal in principle, any scheme would have to deliver value for money for the public and must therefore be developed carefully.§The government itself  in September, responding to a call from the environment select committee of MPs: ※There is no proportionate way to appropriately target such a measure to the areas where it would be most needed and, as such, it would not be an effective use of significant resources.§ Government sources suggest a nationwide diesel scrappage scheme .On Tuesday, the European parliament backed tougher rules for regulating vehicle emissions, including 30,000 per vehicle fines for manufacturers that flout rules. It stopped short of supporting an independent, EU-wide regulator to replace the national ones that failed to prevent the ※dieselgate§＊ scandal prompted by VW＊s cheating of the tests.But : ※Diesel will not disappear from one day to another. But I am quite sure they will disappear much faster than we can imagine.§The mayors of Paris, Madrid and Athens have already signalled a .

May, currently touring the Middle East, said: ※In relation to the issue of diesel cars, obviously we will be producing a new air quality plan. We＊ve been required to do that by the courts. ※Decisions will be taken when we produce that plan 每 obviously we will take final decisions as to what we do. But I＊m very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we＊re looking at what we do in the future.§ Patrick McLoughlin, the then transport secretary, said in June last year that it had been a mistake for Gordon Brown to slash taxes on diesel.Brown, the then chancellor, reduced duty on low-sulphur fuel in 2001, which contributed to an increase in annual diesel car registrations from 3.45m to 8.2m. A government report published in April 2016 showed that diesel cars being sold in the UK  in real-world driving than the legal limit used in official tests. All but the newest diesel cars will face a ?12.50 charge to drive in the planned ultra-low emissions zone under Khan＊s plans. Diesel cars that are more than four years old in 2019 and petrol cars that are more than 13 years old will face the charge 24 hours a day, year-round, in an attempt to cut air pollution. With the congestion charge during weekday hours, the total fee for the most polluting cars to drive through the heart of London will be ?24. Buses, coaches and HGVs that do not meet the emissions standards will have to pay ?100. The zone will apply to all vehicles except black cabs. "																																																			
"An animal rights group is calling for an end to New Zealand＊s ※barbaric§ war on possums after joeys were drowned in a bucket of water at a school fundraiser.It said children were becoming desensitised to violence as a result of the method of killing an animal that is considered a pest in . ※It was clearly inhumane, it was appalling that children were witnessing this violence,§ said Jasmijn de Boo, chief executive of animal rights group Safe.The killings took place during a North Island school＊s annual possum hunt. The possum mothers had been shot and their fur and skins sold. It is illegal to wilfully or recklessly harm any wild animals 每 including possums 每 and every measure must be taken to euthanise possums as humanely as possible, with shooting being the preferred method.De Boo said the recent drownings were not a one-off and that many more New Zealanders were supportive rather than shocked. ※We＊re concerned this will spill over to New Zealand children becoming more desensitised to other sentient beings, as there is good evidence that people who hurt animals are more likely to perpetrate domestic violence or violence against humans so we need to really take this issue seriously.§A  to ban school possum hunts which has garnered close to 9,000 signatures and will be delivered to the education minister, Nikki Kaye, when it reaches 10,000. Possum hunting is a widespread and popular practice across both the North and the South islands, with both amateurs and professionals alike.Do Boo accepted it was a difficult situation given the government pledged to wipe out the species (along with stoats, ferrets and rats) by 2050. ※The conservation of birds is very important, and possums play a role in that but they have been demonised as pests for a long time,§ de Boo said. ※The word ＆pests＊ is problematic because it insinuates they are worthless objects that can be treated without care 每 run over, beaten, whatever. We need to get back to the idea that all animals are sentient beings and they do not deserve a cruel death 每 even possums.§ Safe has suggested exploring more humane alternatives, such as mass sterilisation.The Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) told the school the way it killed the joeys wasn＊t humane, , and the school pledged to work with the SPCA in the future ※to ensure that all animal welfare requirements are met§.Australian brushtail possums were introduced to New Zealand in 1837 by settlers who hoped to establish a roaring trade in possum fur. However the animals quickly got out of control because they faced no natural predators in New Zealand.They had a devastating impact on bird life, competing for food and habitat resources, and climbing into nests to eat eggs and fledglings. They also destroyed native trees with their strong paws, especially rata, totara, titoki, kowhai and kohekohe. The president of Federated Farmers, Katie Milne, said the recent outcry was symptomatic of a growing cultural divide between rural and urban Kiwis, and it was ※essential§ to routinely cull possums to protect wildlife and stop the spread of bovine tuberculosis to farm animals.Milne said the government culling of possums using trapping and poisoning methods had been ※very effective§ in recent years, and the native trees in her region on the west coast of the south island were beginning to return. Poisoning possums is a controversial method in New Zealand because many of the most commonly used poisons 每 including 1080 每 can take hours or even days to kill. ※As a farmer I am used to being faced with life and death, and possum eradication is an essential part of farming life here and protecting the native New Zealand bush and birds,§ Milne said. ※But certainly the way those joeys were killed was not ideal and it could have been done in a better way. For farmers shooting is the best method.§According to the New Zealand Fur Council possums consume 21,000 tons of New Zealand vegetation every day. About 1,500 people are employed in the possum fur and skin business, with the industry generating sales worth between $100m and $150m a year, and killing about 2m possums annually.There have also been a number of forays into selling ※possum pies§ on the west coast of the south island, and possum meat is also used in pet food such as ※possyyum§.West coaster Chris Long, 25, started hunting possums when he was 12, and has paid for ※one-and-a-half-trips around the the world§ with his possum earnings, which on a good day can be up to NZ$700 ($510), or about 50 possums.  ※I come from a place where hunting and fishing is normal, but I do feel sorry for the animals and I don＊t enjoy killing them,§ said Long, who says 5-10% of the trees within a 10km radius of his house have died from possum destruction, which has contributed to landslips in hilly areas.※In Australia I＊ve played with the possums and fed them and it is great fun. They are pretty cool animals. But in this country they are not quite so popular and they are a good form of income for me.§"																																																			
"ropaganda works by sanctifying a single value, such as faith, or patriotism. Anyone who questions it puts themselves outside the circle of respectable opinion. The sacred value is used to obscure the intentions of those who champion it. Today, the value is freedom. Freedom is?a word that powerful people use to shut down thought.When thinktanks and the billionaire press call for freedom, they are careful not to specify whose freedoms they mean. Freedom for some, they suggest, means freedom for all. In certain cases, this is true. You can exercise freedom of thought, for instance, without harming others. In other cases, one person＊s freedom is another＊s captivity.When corporations free themselves from trade unions, they curtail the freedoms of their workers.

"A yellow submarine dubbed  has obtained ※unprecedented data§ from its first voyage exploring one of the deepest and coldest ocean regions on Earth, scientists have said. The robotic submersible was given the name  by irreverent contestants in a public competition. Embarrassed officials decided to ignore the popular vote and instead named the vessel the RRS Sir David Attenborough in honour of the veteran broadcaster. A storm of protest led to a compromise that allowed the name to live on.The submarine plunged to depths as far as 4,000 metres to obtain information about temperature, water flow speed and turbulence from Orkney Passage, a region of the Southern Ocean about 500 miles from the Antarctic Peninsula. The data will help scientists to understand the complex ways that mixing ocean waters affect climate change. Prof Alberto Naveira Garabato from the University of Southampton said: ※The Orkney Passage is a key chokepoint to the flow of abyssal waters in which we expect the mechanism linking changing winds to abyssal water warming to operate. ※Our goal is to learn enough about these convoluted processes to represent them in the models that scientists use to predict how our climate will evolve over the 21st century and beyond. ※We have been able to collect massive amounts of data that we have never been able to capture before due to the way Boaty is able to move underwater. Up until now we have only been able to take measurements from a fixed point, but now we are able to obtain a much more detailed picture of what is happening in this very important underwater landscape.§The submersible was launched from the RRS James Clark Ross as part of the seven-week expedition. It is a new type of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and can travel under ice and reach depths of 6,000 metres, transmitting the data it collects to researchers via a radio link.The universities and science minister, Jo Johnson, said: ※Fresh from its maiden voyage, Boaty is already delivering new insight into some of the coldest ocean waters on Earth, giving scientists a greater understanding of changes in the Antarctic region and shaping a global effort to tackle climate change.§The name Boaty McBoatface was first put forward by the former BBC radio presenter James Hand in response to a public poll organised by the National Environment Research Council to name their new ?200m Arctic research vessel.

" companies planning to drill near a vast coral reef at the mouth of the Amazon river have calculated that the unique ecosystem has a 30% chance of being affected in the event of an oil spill.The unique reef system astonished marine biologists when its existence was widely revealed last year, and is believed it could be the home for dozens of previously unknown species. But activists warn that an oil spill could irreparably damage the 1,000 kilometre-long ecosystem before scientists have even had a chance to study it.※It＊s unlike any other reef that we know about,§ said Sara Ayech, an oil campaigner at the London offices of Greenpeace. ※If the companies drill there＊s a risk of an oil spill and if an oil spill hits the reef, then we could see parts of it destroyed before we even document them.§The Brazilian government has estimated that the Foz de Amazonas, or Amazon Mouth area, could hold 15.6bn barrels of oil. A consortium of oil companies led by French giant Total, and including BP and Brazil＊s state-run oil company Petrobras, snapped up five exploration blocks in the area when they were auctioned off in 2013. In January, Total said it had begun moving equipment to the Amazon area and planned to start drilling this year. The oil reservoirs it hopes to reach are situated in 1,900 metres of water, nearly 200 kilometres from the coast.Scientists from Greenpeace examined the publicly-available Environmental Impact Study Total submitted to the Brazilian authorities and found references to the possibility of an oil spill reaching the reef. Reef structures in the area to be drilled ※present possibilities of being impacted by oil§, the study said. In winter that possibility could be as high as 30.33%, while in summer, 20.93%, the study produced for Total by companies Proceano and AECOM said.In February  it planned to start drilling a block it controls by August 2018. Brazilian company Queiroz Galv?o also has a block it expects to start drilling from next year.As long ago as the 1970s, scientists suspected the existence of a reef hidden under the murky waters of the River Amazon＊s mouth. But it was not until 2012 that they confirmed the system existed, in conditions coral reefs are not commonly found.Last year a paper in Science said there were 61 species of sponge alone in the extensive reef system. .※Scientists are calling it a new biome. And scientists think that there are potentially new species there but they need time to document them,§ said Ayech.In May, prosecutors in the State of Amap芍 asked Brazil＊s government environment agency Ibama to suspend oil exploration and reopen the environmental licensing process.※The data offered by the company does not provide enough security for the environmental licensing to proceed,§ prosecutor Joaquim Cabral told the Guardian in an email. Ibama said in an email it had asked for additional information which it was studying and has yet to grant the licence.※Drilling operation will start only when we have the final authorization from Ibama,§ said a spokesperson for Total in an email. The spokesperson said that the first well was 28 kilometres from the nearest reef element and the second, 38 kilometres away, adding that the company had done extensive environmental studies.※At present, the regulatory agencies are still analysing the Environmental Impact Study, which was based in a conservative scenario, and will only issue the license if they consider the risk acceptable,§ the Total spokesperson said."																																																			
"hen Donald Trump pulled the United States , the world reacted with outrage. And rightly so: the agreement represents a remarkable achievement in international diplomacy 每 a breakthrough after 20 years of failed climate negotiations. But as we rally to defend the Paris deal against the onslaught of an ill-informed bully, we need to resist the temptation to cast the agreement as some kind of saviour. It is not. Its purpose is right and noble, but its substance is nothing short of dangerous.If you look closely at the Paris agreement, you＊ll notice a curious contradiction. The text commits the world＊s governments to limiting global warming to no more than 2C above preindustrial levels. But, strangely enough, the emissions reductions it lays out . Far from it. Even if all the world＊s countries meet their targets (which is very unlikely, since the targets are non-binding) if we do nothing else we＊ll still be hurtling toward more than 3C of global warming, and possibly as high as 4.4C. Way over the threshold. What might our planet look like if it warms by 4C? No one can say for certain, but  show that this level of warming is likely to bring about heatwaves not seen on Earth for 5m years. Southern Europe could dry up into a desert. Sea levels could rise by 1.2 meters before the century is out, drowning cities like Amsterdam and New York. Furthermore, 40% of species will be at risk of extinction. Most of our rainforests will wither away. Crop yields could collapse by 35%, destabilising the world＊s food system and triggering widespread famine. In short, a 4C world looks very bleak indeed.So why is nobody sounding the alarm about this? Why is nobody freaking out? The Paris agreement assures us that everything will be OK. But scientists are not so convinced. Here＊s the backstory. The Paris agreement relies on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Over the past couple of decades, the IPCC has been busy devising hundreds of different scenarios, or ※pathways§, for how much we need to cut our emissions if we want a decent chance of averting catastrophic climate change. But as they were running the numbers, they stumbled upon a rather inconvenient fact. The necessary emissions reductions turn out to be so steep that getting there requires that we slow down and gradually reverse the pace of economic growth.This conclusion did not go down well with politicians and industry bosses, and everyone knew it would be a tough sell in international negotiations. So the IPCC fudged it and began  that relied on the assumption that sometime in the near future 每 by around 2020 每 we will have ※negative emissions technologies§ up and running, which will pull carbon out of the atmosphere. Speculating on the hope of future technology, suddenly the IPCC was assuring us that we can get by with much more relaxed emissions reductions. We can keep our existing economic model intact, it said 每 and rich countries can maintain their high levels of consumption 每 so long as we can figure out a way to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. There are  out there for how to do this, like seeding the soil with pulverised rocks, or pouring iron into the ocean to stimulate plankton growth (now ). But the IPCC relies on one in particular, which it considers the most promising. It＊s called Beccs, which stands for ※bio-energy with carbon capture and storage§. Basically, the idea is to develop enormous tree plantations that will suck carbon out of the atmosphere. Then we harvest them, turn them into pellets and ship them around the world to power stations to be burned for energy, capturing the carbon emissions and storing the gases deep under the ground, where they won＊t have any impact on the climate. Voila 每 an energy system that pulls CO2 out of the sky. What＊s not to love?Beccs features in more than 80% of the IPCC pathways, which means it sits at the very centre of the Paris agreement 每 even though it is not mentioned in the text. But there is a  among scientists that Beccs won＊t work. The technology has never been proven at scale, and there＊s no way it will appear in time to save us. Even if it did, it would require that we create plantations equivalent to three times the size of India, which would eat up one-third of the planet＊s arable land, according to Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the . This would make it impossible for us to feed the world＊s population. And transforming that much land into bio-energy monoculture would trigger ecosystem collapse that could be disastrous for all of us. In other words, Beccs is simply . The Paris text could have been honest about its reliance on Beccs, giving us all a chance to scrutinise the plan and push for a better one. Instead we＊ve been left hanging our collective future on a myth.If we accept that Beccs won＊t save us, we have to face up to some difficult truths. For one, we need to commit to much more aggressive emissions reductions. Anderson  that to have a 50% chance of keeping below 2C, industrialised countries will have to cut emissions by 8-10% per year (beginning in 2015) until net zero in 2050. That might sound easy on paper, but it＊s remarkably difficult. Even if we throw everything we have into efficiency improvements and renewable energy technologies, they will help us reduce emissions by at most 4% per year. So how do we bridge the rest of the gap? Well, industrialised countries will have no choice but to downscale their economic activity by 4-6% per year. And poor countries are going to have to follow suit after 2025, downscaling by about 3% per year. In other words, the climate science recognises a clear  imperative. De-growth might sound scary, but it＊s really not. All it means is easing the intensity of our economy, cutting the excesses of the very richest, sharing what we have instead of plundering the Earth for more, and liberating ourselves from the frenetic consumerism that we all know does nothing to improve our wellbeing or happiness. Scholars are already busy sketching out , but one thing is for sure: it won＊t look anything like global capitalism as it exists today. And that＊s OK 每 evolution is good. After all, no one says ※this is the best novel or sculpture or smartphone ever and will never be surpassed§. So why be timid about imagining our way beyond capitalism? We face a stark choice: either we act now, right-sizing our economy and managing the transition in a careful and controlled way, or climate change will do it for us. If we wait for the latter option it will be unimaginably destructive and chaotic. According to Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, 4C of global warming  at least 5% of global GDP per year indefinitely, and possibly as much as 20% 每 economic crisis on a scale never seen before.This should shock us out of our climate complacency. The Paris agreement is a step in the right direction, but it needs to be much stronger. We need a deal that locks down ambitious emissions reductions 每 without fear of offending the powers that be 每 by pointing us in the direction of a new and better economy. Our future depends on it."																																																			
"ome of Australia＊s largest listed companies, including Woodside, Rio Tinto and Santos, are likely to face sweeping changes to the way in which they model, plan for and disclose risk from climate change to investors. How they respond will affect their ability to attract funding from lenders, insurers and superannuation funds who are .The release last week of  is expected to add pressure on publicly listed companies to formalise their climate risk disclosure practices 每 particularly through scenario analysis 每 or risk investors pulling finance and rating agencies making assumptions about their risk profile.The taskforce＊s purpose is to ensure more methodical, comparable and consistent disclosure on climate-related risks and opportunities. It is also to stave off a global financial crisis-style correction as the financial community manages its exposure to assets which could rapidly become redundant as limits on carbon emissions tighten to 2050, well within the lifetime of most large-scale infrastructure projects. An independent financial thinktank,  ※The aim is to enable better decision-making by capital markets and, ultimately, to ensure the financial system is not going to be exposed to the sort of systemic risk or shock that we＊ve seen in the past with financial crises,§ said Michael Wilkins, S&P＊s global representative on the taskforce. ※The more information that is out there, the more that it can be incorporated into decision-making and better capital allocation with less risk of systemic shock.§The taskforce＊s recommendations will go to the  summit in Hamburg on 6-7 July 2017. More than 100 firms with market capitalisations of more than US$3.3tn and financial firms responsible for assets of more than US$24tn have encouraged the adoption of the taskforce＊s recommendations.※The Paris agreement means much of the world has to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest and it＊s clear that many businesses are not pursuing a strategy that＊s consistent with this,§ said Kate Mackenzie, head of finance and investment at the now defunct Climate Institute.※It＊s not just the resources sector, but those who invest and finance them, and those who rely upon them. Both the oil industry and the auto industry are right now coming to terms with the prospect that the era of internal combustion engines may be ending much faster than many of us thought.§In Australia 每 where carbon-intensive oil, gas, coal and iron ore extraction industries drive trade, economic prosperity and geopolitical influence 每 many of the largest listed banks, insurers and super funds are heavily invested in these areas and are set to drive further change. ※The financial sector is leading and that＊s partly due to the campaigns they＊ve faced for lending to fossil fuels and how that fits into their overall portfolios,§ said Dan Goucher of the environmental campaign group Market Forces., earlier this year, in which he stressed the need for banks and insurers to act on the taskforce＊s recommendations, is widely seen as a turning point for Australia＊s financial sector. As a result, institutional investors such as Blackrock, Fidelity and Legal & General Investment Management are voting to support shareholder resolutions on climate risk disclosure. It is a seachange for Australia＊s business sector and surpasses any resistance to change at a political level.But for energy and utility companies 每 those most affected by the rise of clean technologies, carbon caps and investor pressure to quantify how assets will continue to deliver shareholder value in a carbon-constrained future 每 progress has been patchy.  in particular have argued that putting sensitive information on their asset and resource base into the public domain could jeopardise their competitive advantage globally.※AGL is a leader in terms of climate risk disclosure. They＊re one of only two companies which has done scenario analysis publicly. The other is BHP Billiton. Origin has made commitments but hasn＊t really delivered in terms of disclosure. The smaller utilities have done very little,§ said Goucher. Although it is a struggle to see how oil and gas companies such as Woodside can transition to a low carbon future beyond deploying gas as a transition fuel, Emma Herd, at the Investors Group on Climate Change, is optimistic: ※There is much energy companies can do in the technology space to adapt to new challenges.§Not long ago investors were encouraged to divest from fossil fuel companies entirely. Instead, such companies called on investors to engage with them about their concerns. This has led to some stakeholder resolutions requiring companies to publish more information on climate risks, the most recent one being at The taskforce＊s recommendations go a step further in trying to ensure disclosures are comparable between companies to facilitate more effective engagement on the issue. Photos of green landscapes in annual reports will no longer cut it. ※Disclosure isn＊t just about publishing pretty reports any more,§ said Mackenzie. ※It＊s about demonstrating how you are responding to climate change-related risks, and why.§ "																																																			
"ne can understand New Zealand＊s apparent frustration with invasive Australian brushtail possums. One can conjure up genuine sadness for the damage the possums cause through their unwavering appetite for birds＊ eggs and one can feel real concern for the plight of the native species being edged out. Like many invasive species, they are a nightmare made real. Fast-multiplying bullies. Monsters. And like all monsters they need to be caught and their babies given a damn good drowning in a bucket of water in front of children at a school fundraiser.You may think I＊m joking about this last bit, but this  this week during one of New Zealand＊s popular (and normally more humane) public possum-hunts. As part of the annual event, the mother possum was shot and skinned and her babies drowned. International efforts to tackle invasive non-native species just took a questionable lean toward the unsavoury and I think we need to talk about it.Possum hunts aren＊t new to New Zealand and, in fact, a few countries encourage such ※mob-vigilante§ action against invasive species. On a specific day each year in eastern Australia, for instance, the public are encouraged to take part in the big ※§ during which they are permitted to catch hundreds of invasive poisonous cane toads. Willing Australians citizens round them up, alive, and pass them onto authorities who weigh them one-by-one and considerately euthanise them before .Invasive snakes too have also been on the receiving end of this ※fun§ form of wildlife-control. In the Florida Everglades 每 another habitat besieged by species that do not belong 每 government officials co-organise a real-life , with prizes of up to $1,500 for would-be hunters of invasive Burmese pythons. To take part all you need is a gun, a $25 dollar registration fee and an 80% pass score in an online exam that tests your non-native snake identification abilities. So New Zealanders aren＊t alone in bringing a bit of sport to their conservation challenges and, on the whole, we might forgive them that. It＊s just that other nations don＊t use a bucket, I guess. And it＊s not done in a school.And so, let us go back to that bucket. Could you do it? I mean, really ＃ could you drown some baby possums in a bucket in front of an audience of children? I mean this in all seriousness so please do take some time to think through this question, of which there are likely to be only two possible answers: A: ※Yes, I could drown a possum.§B: ※No, I don＊t think I could drown a possum.§I think I＊m a No. I＊m a No, unless the baby possums somehow gained Gremlin-like sentience and came for my throat and I had to defend myself, which is unlikely given that baby possums are wholly defenceless and, being young, would probably be looking not for my jugular, but for a warm armpit in which to nestle. And so I don＊t think I could drown a baby possum. There. I said it. Now you know. But people drowning invasive species is not unheard of, even though .I have met drowners. My childhood naturalist mentor once shocked me by telling me that he regularly drowned the squirrels he trapped in his garden in a bucket. He was proud, I think, to be tackling the problem of invasive species on the frontline. He was doing his bit for the nation, he argued. He seemed to quite like my shock. Even still, I think we both knew however, even then, that every grey squirrel drowned would be replaced by more in time. But, still 每 it was in the national interest, apparently. He was a soldier, bringing back ※our green and pleasant land§ and the grey menace? They were just ＃ again, they were just monsters. You probably know people who did it too. Some people can desensitise themselves to the suffering of invasive species, it seems. They had it coming, they must tell themselves.How do we get like this? The press probably play a significant part in upgrading the horror. Invasive species such as  and  and demon shrimp are often referred to as ※armies§ or ※hordes§ or ※invaders§ in articles or TV pieces. Are these genuine conservation concerns? Yes. Is this well-considered coverage? No, not at all. For to give invasive species purpose and character like this is folly. Invasive species have no purpose other than, like every else, to make more of themselves. The problem is simply that they are managing this better than the creatures with whom they cohabit. (You＊d think we＊d recognise more easily the commonality that we share with them.) Plus, we intentionally released the possums, cane toads and grey squirrels so it＊s our fault really. If there really are monsters, they are us.Though invasive species are clearly one of the most serious international conservation issues that we face at the present time, making monsters of animals and desensitising ourselves to their suffering is outdated, outmoded and outright questionable. There is only one animal that has mastered the waves and the sky. There is only one animal who deemed species interchangeable and released them on the islands they thought best. There is only one animal that has forged metal into buckets. And guess what ＃ it isn＊t the possum."

The majority of buyers are mainland Chinese, who smuggle the worked ivory across the border. Hong Kong is also perpetuating the illegal market: more than a third of licensed ivory dealers have been found to advise buyers on ways to smuggle ivory out of the city, according to a recent .The bill would ban the import and export of worked and raw ivory by 2021, including banning the possession and sale of all ivory obtained before 1990.The move follows the ban of mainland China＊s domestic ivory trade, seen by many as a critical step in the global battle against poaching. Asian demand for ivory is widely believed to be behind the sharp rise in elephant poaching over the last decade. Ivory factories in mainland China were officially , and the rest of the retail outlets will close by the end of the year.The official launch of the bill to the legislative council comes after  calling for an end to the trade. On 6 June this year, lawmakers consulted the public about the government＊s ivory ban proposal. During this consultation process , manager of the Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, highlighted to legislators the human cost of ivory.※The truth is that people are being killed ... people are seeing their families being destroyed because of the trade,§ he told Radio Television of Hong Kong (RTHK). ※Five years will be at least 500 rangers killed on the frontline. Are we happy to sacrifice 500 rangers for people to be able to sell off a few tonnes of ivory?§ he said.Hong Kong announced it would follow China＊s move to close the domestic trade in late 2016 through a three step plan. The government has now started the legislative process to bring it to fruition.※Now the ball is in the legislators＊ court, we call on lawmakers to close the domestic ivory market as soon as possible§ said WWF Hong Kong＊s senior wildlife crime officer, Cheryl Lo.※The trade is well-known for its illegality, including smuggling elephant tusks from Africa, laundering with the legal ivory license as a front and trafficking into mainland . The government must act swiftly to end this situation and increase penalty on wildlife crime to a 10-year imprisonment,§ she added.The new amendment to the Protection of Endangered Species of  and Plants was presented to Hong Kong lawmakers on 14 June, which was described as a conscious effort to ※eradicate§ illicit poaching of elephants across Africa and Asia.Environment minister Wong Kam-sing  in a statement the city must respond to the demands of the international community, and the ivory trade would ※fully come to a close§ by December 2021.

Pruitt is also , which protects Americans＊ drinking water, as part of an effort to roll back environmental regulations that the Trump administration believes are stymieing economic activity. In response to written questions from senators during his confirmation hearing, Pruitt said he was ※familiar with the concept of environmental justice and believe the administrator plays an important role in this regard. I agree that it is important that all Americans be treated equally under the law, including the environmental laws.§John Coequyt, campaign director of the Sierra Club, : ※To cut the environmental justice program at EPA is just racist. I can＊t describe it in any other terms than a move to leave those communities behind. I can＊t imagine what the justification would be, other than racism.§ Environmental justice, or environmental racism, has been acknowledged by the federal government since Bill Clinton signed  in 1994 instructing agencies to address the ※disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs ... on minority populations and low-income populations§. Years of urban planning decisions and sporadic regulation has led to a situation in which black children are  to have asthma as their white counterparts. Meanwhile, nearly half of America＊s Latino population lives in counties that do not meet EPA air quality standards. This burden was starkly demonstrated last year in Flint, Michigan, where  has ravaged a largely black city. A recent  by the Michigan state government found that the lead poisoning was caused, in part, by ※systemic racism§. Amid a lengthy history of such problems, community campaigners have accused the EPA of failing to respond forcefully enough. Over the past 20 years, the agency  nine out of 10 complaints from communities plagued by pollution. The EPA has yet to find a business in breach of the Civil Rights Act＊s Title VI provisions against discrimination on environmental grounds. In September, the US Commission on Civil Rights released  that found the EPA ※has a history of being unable to meet its regulatory deadlines and experiences extreme delays in responding to Title VI complaints in the area of environmental justice§.The report highlighted the plight of Uniontown, a predominately black community in Alabama. The EPA allowed coal ash to be dumped in a landfill in the town in order to appease economic interests and failed to deal with years of complaints from residents who said they suffered from ailments and the odor of the waste dump, the report stated. On Thursday, the EPA also made initial steps in winding back methane emissions standards imposed by Barack Obama＊s administration. The agency withdrew its request that oil and gas operators provide information on equipment and levels of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, emitted during drilling operations. The move follows complaints from nine states that the request was too onerous on businesses. ※By taking this step, EPA is signaling that we take these concerns seriously and are committed to strengthening our partnership with the states,§ said Pruitt.※Today＊s action will reduce burdens on businesses while we take a closer look at the need for additional information from this industry.§"

"ARTMOOR: The best way to see the country of the high moorland is, I am now convinced, from horseback. A docile eight-year-old mare carried me for three hours over Holne Moor and along the thickly wooded valley of the Dart and provided a morning of great delight. Early in the ride, descending from the moor to the river valley, we started a buzzard from the heather. The bird rose into the air and crossed the valley in gracious soaring and gliding. The silhouette of the buzzard is particularly appropriate to its function as a bird of prey 每 a menacing dark brown shape with broad wings upturned at the tips. Its loud mewing call which echoed in the confined valley was an eerie warning to small creatures on the ground.On the moor again after a steep climb from the valley we found groups of wild ponies. June is a time when most of the mares have foals with them and as they apparently resent the approach of mounted horses it was wise to give them a wide berth. Skirting Venford Reservoir surrounded by its coniferous soil-holding belt, we climbed to 1,300 feet to see a fine panorama of the tors of Dartmoor spreading to north and east. Holne Moor is crossed by a regular line of upright granite blocks spaced at 200 yard intervals and augmented by occasional ancient Celtic crosses. The origin of these markers, which seem to fit with a direct line between Buckfastleigh and Tavistock, is obscure, but local legend believes them to mark a monastic route between medieval foundations at these two centres. On lower ground as we returned to the stables the hedgerows were rich in birdlife. Chaffinches and bullfinches abounded: I have never before heard such an assembly of cuckoos as the wooded combes of the moor hold this summer. "

"Who is responsible for China＊s chronic and deadly air pollution? That depends on who you ask. Officials blame the weather or outdoor barbecues, activists blame steel companies and coal-fired power plants. But Yu Wensheng blames only one actor: the government.The 50-year-old lawyer recently launched an unprecedented suit against the authorities in three regions in , claiming they have failed in their responsibilities.

A Chinese court ordered US oil giant  who claimed their livelihoods suffered after a spill at an oil rig operated by the company.China allowed nongovernmental organisations to , with the goal of civil society taking a greater role in holding polluters accountable. NGOs with government affiliation and backing have been much more likely to have a case accepted by courts than independent groups.But one of Yu＊s colleagues sees little point in targeting companies.※We have to sue the government,§ says Cheng Hai, another lawyer involved in the case. ※A business can only control the emissions from its factories, but the government can reduce emissions across all the polluting industries. We have laws, regulations and systems to combat pollution, but they＊re not being enforced.§Their initial attempt at filing the case was rebuffed by a Beijing court, with court officials saying a case against each government needed to be filed separately in each location.※There＊s no point in just suing one government, such as Beijing,§ Cheng says. ※This is a regional problem and all three governments need to be held accountable for there to be any effect. If we don＊t sue, the air will just get worse.§The lawyers have since refiled their cases and are waiting for a response.

"ll over the planet, we are are facing the most urgent time in human history, the most dire situation of all: the effects of the destruction of our earth. Ice-caps are melting, the climate is changing, and species of animals and plants are being threatened and dying out. Yet many of ※the powers that be§ are still supporting, pushing and funding the destruction of our life-giving earth, through mining, various forms of agriculture and unsustainable energy creation and usage.The future is bleak. However, some countries are doing it right, banning plastics and making major moves towards sustainability and green energy. And then there＊s ※Australia§. A place so entrenched in the blood of colonialism that it has been unable to even consider listening to what First Nations people have been saying about care for country, even when it comes to making decisions that will affect our environment.※The oldest continuing culture on earth§: we hear and see this, time and again. Yet how often do people consider what it really means? Considering that when colonisation first occurred our country was so pristine that white ※explorers§ even said it looked like a rich man＊s garden back in England (check out Bill Gammage＊s, Greatest Estate on Earth). We often hear these references to  in a romantic way that embraces cultural practice but can distance us from any possible engagement with our knowledge systems, especially in regards to issues like global warming and climate change. Or for that matter, widespread health problems, education or social issues, and governance.Indigenous knowledges have been greatly suppressed as a part of the colonial process in Australia. Our people lived completely sustainably, and in balance with each other and country, for over 60,000 years. We kept our country clean through practices like fire-stick farming, we monitored our species of animals and plants through our totem systems. We respected other people, other countries, other laws, cultures and even other creation stories. Many of the problems that western colonialism has, we simply did not. What is often forgotten is that we still have access to our culture and even though many languages and cultural practices have been lost, much of our knowledges have been kept. Knowledges that through over 60,000 years of compiling and refining, have the greatest potential to sustain human life on this planet.And yet, even while the planet continues to heat up, people still don＊t connect the dots. Many people still completely undervalue Indigenous knowledges, in spite of people like award-winning scientist, broadcaster and environmentalist, Dr David Suzuki urging society and our institutions not to. On his last trip here, Suzuki said that ※Australia could learn from its Indigenous peoples§. He went on to say: ※We need to have a paradigm shift; to me the paradigm shift is that we have to see the world as Indigenous people see it.§Of course this is something many of our people already know and have always known.Still the urgency of global warming, and the destruction that capitalism and colonialism has caused our planet, continues to be ignored by Australian governments. This is a worldwide human issue impacting on our children＊s right to a future. My understanding of the Murri perspective of humanity means that country is taken care of, in order to sustain life. I believe this is connected to the fact that many different Indigenous groups across the continent and the world have creation stories that relate directly to land and/or waters which ensures that all land is held sacred in its production of life. This relationship between people and land lays the foundations for the relationship between people. We cannot treat land with disrespect without disrespecting ourselves and each other.My father 每 the late Dr Ross Watson 每 taught me about how our ontology (what we perceive to be life) and epistemology＊s (how we lived out that perception of life) foundations are respect for land, and thus life. So everything we created and even the things we didn＊t create had a specific purpose and use that fit into our perception of life, and helped to carry out that perception of life. Anything that caused widespread destruction to our country or people was either never invented or was adapted and managed to ensure that our epistemology remained respectful to land and people, while many other things 每 like the wheel for example 每 was just never necessary. It is my understanding that Murri people lived a life of abundance and autonomy, all the while maintaining a proper relationship with lands and peoples. This is not to propose an overly romanticised view of precolonial life. Of course we had conflict between people, and of course our people knew tough times, but the conflict and toughness was mitigated by our philosophy, logic, ontology and law.When we say ※White ＆Australia＊ has a black future§, we are saying that Murri culture and law must be considered for there to be a viable future. Knowing our philosophy, logic, ontology and epistemology gives our young people the opportunity to find innovative ways to carry out culture and law with whatever we have, wherever we are, however we can. This is not something new, but our culture has always been resiliently dynamic in its ability to thrive, even among the depression of colonialism and attempted genocide. We may not now know all of our languages, songs, dances and stories, but many of us have had our knowledges translated and interpreted to us, and through us, our whole lives.Dr Lilla Watson talks about how Murri people are always facing forwards, looking to the future. She teaches me about how dynamic our culture is and why that＊s so important.White Australia is often moving towards the future while facing backwards, with a closed mind to anything beyond the limits of the colonial logic. It＊s this logic that has allowed us to get so far into the destruction of our planet. Surely we cannot believe that this logic will save our future? The only possible, sustainable and empowering future we could have would be one where the sovereignty of our people, our knowledges and of our lands and laws are respected, valued, heard and implemented throughout ※modern Australian§ life. The question is, will white ※Australia§ be mature and reasonable enough to approach this problem where it began: with colonialism?At the end of the day, if ※Australia§ wants to survive and combat global warming, First Nations sovereignty and governance is the best chance it has. As my aunty Lilla says: ※We need to make sure our future stretches as far ahead of us, as our past does behind us.§"

This is empire building wholly colonial in spirit. This is capitalism as we currently practice it.Built into our economic DNA is the notion that inequality is a necessary evil, that there is nothing to be done about it. Put another way, wealth creates poverty. Colonialism has, perhaps, best equipped those ※others§ from ex-colonies with an intimate understanding of what corporations, given free reign, will continue to do. Wealth will always be funneled upwards to make the rich more so while the rest are made poorer.

"On 9 December 1952 the Great Smog officially ended 每 for five days a thick layer of air pollution, mostly caused by coal fires, had covered London and caused the deaths of thousands of residents. 64 years later the  to tackle the problem. This week () and the  next week. After two centuries of fatal London fogs, what have we learnt?Fogs were relatively common in , but by the early 1800s these had become deadly, as the smoke and fumes from industrialisation and urban growth were trapped by calm, still air. It was not just the pollution that was a threat to life and health, but also the traffic, and newspapers were full of tragic stories of accidents: in the 1837 December fog the  reported that ※an aged female named Jane Wilson§ was ※knocked down by a cart and severely injured§ and Chelsea resident Mr Phillips was thrown out of his chaise into the road where a ※cart passed over his right thigh, and fractured it dreadfully§. Animals suffered too - in  by a December fog that left the ※fat cattle＃panting and coughing§, and many of the animals collapsed and died.The Victorians are famous for their public health activity 每 ambitious sewer schemes, the introduction of Medical Officers of , and vaccination programmes 每 so why did they struggle, as we do, to deal with deadly air pollution? One problem lay in the fact that the smogs had many causes. Heavy industry was one source, but so too were the railways and steamer-boats,and particularly domestic coal-burning fires. Various societies were formed to campaign for what was often called ＆smoke abatement＊, but they met with resistance. At a meeting of the ＆＊ in Manchester, a representative from the Health Committee of the Salford Corporation (like a modern city council) won applause from a working class audience when he objected to smoke abatement because ※?§ If ＆big business＊ wasn＊t going to reform, why should individuals? Smoke abatement campaigners seem to have thought that education was all that was needed: in 1881 the Smoke Abatement Committee opened a  in London which attracted an extraordinary 116,000 visitors in just a few months; all the installations were independently tested to make sure that the manufacturers＊ claims were accurate. Yet this did not lead to a mass take-up of smoke-reducing technology, and .Some industries had been regulated by the , but only in London, and this excluded some factories such as glass works and potteries. Rather oddly, a lot of the discussion about this Act focused not on the health risks of smoke,  (estimated as high as ?2 million) - as one member of the House of Lords suggested: ※The smoke so affected the clothing of the working classes that it was computed every mechanic paid at least five times the amount of the original cost of his shirt for the number of washings rendered necessary.§  Even if it saved on washing bills, there was a genuine fear that over-regulation might lead to job losses. Worse, the Victorians were also concerned that reforming domestic fireplaces would actually make people , rather than healthier. Although open fire places were serious sources of coal smoke pollution, they had one advantage over more efficient systems: they created draughts. Through most of the nineteenth century medical professionals thought that disease was spread by ＆miasmas＊, clouds of harmful matter. One way to tackle the danger of miasma was to ensure air did not become ＆stagnant＊, and open fireplaces helped to create a ＆healthy＊ circulation of air. While the larger, airier homes of the middle and upper classes could be ventilated in other ways,  Of course, this could be solved with serious slum clearances and massive investment in homes for the poor, but it proved hard to justify that expense on the grounds that it would prevent air pollution. In any case, reformers worried, people were ＆sentimentally attached＊ to their open fires, and resisted technological change.: taxes on new stoves or fireplaces, restrictions on certain manufacturing plants, the formation of small local societies to help people buy efficient stoves ＆by instalments＊, and so on. But one problem not tackled was the rather obvious one: pollution travels. Responsibility for enforcing anti-pollution and anti-smoke laws rested, by the late 19 century, with local governments and the London County Council, so if pollution was blowing in from a factory in an uncooperative neighbouring jurisdiction, there was nothing councils could do to enforce the limited rules that existed. In 1914 central government was finally persuaded to set up a committee to reconsider the legislation about pollution, but its work was interrupted by the outbreak of war.It was not until 1956 that a Select Committee＊s recommendations, pushed by backbenchers against a sceptical Conservative government, led to the passing of the , a direct response to the smog of 1952. For the first time, this Act regulated domestic fireplaces as well as industrial furnaces, and created  where only smokeless fuels could be burnt.Although a milestone in public health, just 60 years later Londoners are dying, again, from polluted air. Although the for this problem will be doubled the challenges remain essentially the same faced by the Smoke Abatement Leagues in the 1800s: the causes are complex, some pollution is (thought to be) linked to economic growth and jobs, there are social reasons why people resist changes (especially if they require personal sacrifices, such as giving up car or air travel) and the miasma of pollution still travels . Do we have any new solutions?"																																																			
"People who have been following Australia＊s tortured climate change policy debate for a long time could be forgiven for wondering whether the whole area is cursed.Just when it looks like there could be a prospect of progress, an obstacle emerges. In this case, the obstacle is Donald Trump,  has turned America from leader of the free world into free rider.The US president＊s willingness to surrender global leadership on important issues is, from this distance, truly unfathomable. Even his withdrawal patter on Friday morning was pathetic. America was out, but would come back in if it could get a better deal.

A week from now, a much anticipated report from the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, will be made public.For months, Finkel has been beavering away trying to save the government from the significant problem it created for itself when it decided, after an internal rebellion,  for the electricity sector. He has been trying to come up with alternative options which would give the market a clear signal to kickstart new investment in generation capacity 每 with an eye to Australia＊s emissions reduction commitments. This is no easy brief, particularly with one arm tied behind your back.The word around the major interest groups says Finkel will maintain his  that an emissions intensity scheme would be a good option, but he will also recommend the government consider a low emissions target, which in practice works like a technology-neutral renewable energy target.A low emissions target is a regulation requiring that a percentage of electricity be generated annually from ※low-emissions§ sources. This will certainly be renewables and gas. It could even be high efficiency coal if you were (1) a government wanting to placate Australia＊s resources sector (which is already warming its jets for ※axe the carbon tax§ round two), and (2) a government needing to apply a stun gun to climate sceptics inside your own party room.Including coal in a low emissions target would be a completely ludicrous development, but ludicrous is what you get after 10 years of zero sum, win-at-all-costs, peak stupid politics.If you engage in the sort of destructive political madness the Coalition has engaged in over the past decade, you unfortunately get to be the hostage of your dancing partners, both internal and external 每 unless you develop the guts to stand up and tell them to get stuffed.Steering a low emissions target through a party room which contains a rump of climate sceptics, who are already campaigning full tilt to get rid of the current renewable energy target, isn＊t even the hard part.The really tricky bit will come after that.A low emissions target isn＊t a silver bullet that will magically make Australia meet its Paris emissions reduction targets, particularly if the target isn＊t ambitious.Additional abatement measures will be required on top to meet the current Paris commitments, and there will be internal fights about what those measures should be, and their impact on power prices.It doesn＊t take much imagination to envisage a scenario where government conservatives would argue that one foolproof way for Australia to get out of its Paris ※problem§ would be to get out of Paris, or substantially lower the level of ambition, using the US exit as justification.A bunch of people inside the government are already saying this 每  每 and I believe most of them mean it. You don＊t have to ask me how dangerous these discussions get in the Coalition. We can just ask Turnbull, who lost the party leadership over the issue back in 2009.To their credit, Turnbull and the energy minister, , are absolutely holding the line. Turnbull pushed through the Paris ratification five minutes after Trump was elected, and both say Australia will not withdraw from the accord.Frydenberg is also trying to thread the needle on Finkel. He＊s mapped out a route through the obstacle course, strapped on his crash helmet, and set off at a steady jog.But again, it＊s not just the Coalition＊s tortured internals the prime minister and the energy minister have to war game about. The government also has to think about how its reworked energy policy might ultimately attract bipartisan support.This might seem a laughable concept given all the toxic sludge that＊s gone under the bridge this past decade, but the problem the government faces in a public policy sense 每 a demonstrably sub-par energy grid 每 can＊t be solved unless industry finally gets some certainty out of Canberra.Even if Frydenberg demonstrates over the coming months that he has the wisdom of Solomon and the magic skills of Penn & Teller, and can somehow emerge from his own temperamental party room with a workable and credible climate and energy policy, business won＊t believe we＊ve finally declared a truce in the climate wars until a truce between the major parties is actually declared.Stakeholders in the energy market are completely over all the brinkmanship and the bullshit. They want a fix, and they are delivering that message loudly and clearly to both sides of politics.Getting a durable public policy fix that will unlock the dollars required for new investment means the government will have to deliver a policy that has a sufficient level of ambition to convince Labor to sign up.Labor isn＊t opposed in principle to a low emissions target, and has already stepped back from its original ambition on carbon pricing in an effort to try find where the mythical centre on climate policy might be.But Labor will oppose a low emissions target that isn＊t a low emissions target in practice, and if national policy is still bitterly contested, reason suggests investors will keep their wallets in their back pockets.In the end, all this comes down to three simple questions.Does the government have the collective fortitude to ignore Trump＊s shameful audition to be the mayor of Pittsburgh, and try instead to do what＊s in Australia＊s interests, both as a nation and as a responsible citizen of the world?Do Turnbull and Frydenberg have the guts, the intellect and the dexterity to try to push through to get a sensible climate and energy policy, regardless of all the obstacles they face?And if the answer to question two is yes, will Coalition colleagues stop punching themselves (and the country) in the head and let them?"

Other manufacturers have also used techniques to give lower emissions readings in lab tests than in real world driving.Germany and Spain are among the nations accused of failing to set up penalty systems to deter such violations of emissions law and failing to punish offenders where crimes have been committed. The accused countries have two months to respond, after which the commission could send a ※reasoned opinion§ before ultimately filing a suit at the European court of justice in Luxembourg.The EU＊s industry commissioner, El?bieta Bie里kowska, said: ※Abiding by the law is first and foremost the duty of car manufacturers. But national authorities across the EU must ensure that car manufacturers actually comply with the law.§The UK is one of four countries accused of issuing approvals for VW Group cars and not applying national provisions or penalties, despite the company＊s use of illegal software. The commission argues that the UK and Germany have unlawfully refused to disclose details of national investigations into potential irregularities in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by VW and other carmakers.※The commission has bared its teeth and told member states it＊s time to act against the dishonest carmakers that have been manipulating tests and poisoning the air by turning off exhaust treatment systems,§ said Greg Archer, the clean vehicles director of the green campaign group,  ※Dirty diesels must now be recalled and fixed and national regulators must stop protecting their friends and clients in the automotive industry.§Under the current approval system, national authorities are responsible for checking that car models meet EU regulations before they can be sold, and for sanctioning auto manufacturers that break the law.Brussels has tabled proposals for greater EU oversight of national approval systems, although measures to mandate independent inspections of vehicles were , after interventions from EU states＊ transport ministries. This is reported to have angered Bie里kowska.French MEP Karima Delli, who is vice-president of the European parliament＊s inquiry into dieselgate, said that while France had been spared legal papers thus far, ※it is probably only a question of time§.She said: ※The final results of the French inquiry launched by environment minister S谷gol豕ne Royal have yet to be published, and judicial proceedings against several car manufacturers including Renault are still ongoing.

"ith over half the world＊s population now living in cities, and  people due to join them by 2035, urban ※liveability§ has become a pressing concern.What can be done to make city living safer, healthier and less alienating? How can design tackle rising urban inequality and promote social integration? And what, if anything, is the role of the private sector? A panel of property developers, charities, city councils, architects and academics gathered to discuss these questions at a Guardian Roundtable, chaired by Guardian journalist and editor Tess Riley and supported by property and infrastructure company Lendlease.The world＊s most liveable cities (think Melbourne, Vancouver, Vienna) are not necessarily the richest or most beautiful, according to Helene Joffe, professor of psychology at UCL, yet they excel in sociability: friendly streets, mixed neighbourhoods, vibrant public spaces.※When we ask people to think about their city aspirations, we find social connectedness comes out top of the list,§ said Joffe. ※People want to be part of a community in cities.§Scott Cain from Future Cities Catapult, a centre for the advancement of smart cities, concurred: ※Regardless of whether you＊re an introvert or an extrovert, social interaction remains the most important factor in wellbeing.§Ageing cities expert June Crown said  from our bustling cities is a key part of this. A number of initiatives are working to address this, including , which incorporates visits to the elderly into people＊s jogging routines, and , which pairs young professionals with older residents in their communities. Apart from anything else, Love Your Neighbour highlights how much young people crave community, said Alex Smith, founder of the North London Cares charity that runs the programme.Central to what＊s happening in our cities is what＊s unfolding on our streets. The key word for Yolande Barnes, director of world research at Savills, is ※density§: the more people you can squeeze in per block, the more chance of a hustle-and-bustle ambience. She cites the Centro district of Madrid and New York＊s Chinatown as classic archetypes of tightly packed neighbourhoods with a buzz.Urban density is in vogue among commercial property developers. If we are to avoid ever more urban sprawl, the current argument goes, cities need to grow upwards rather than outwards. But does building dense, vertical cities mean we are effectively saying farewell to green urban spaces? Not necessarily, said Paul King, managing director of sustainability and external affairs at Lendlease in Europe. King gave the example of Elephant and Castle, a south London district renowned for brutalist concrete, being regenerated by Lendlease. Although the area will be more densely populated than before, the ?3bn project includes street trees, pedestrian areas, water recovery systems and roof gardens, he said. Achieving sustainability without density isn＊t always easy. Sue Riddlestone described a housing project Bioregional is currently pursuing in London. All 600 proposed homes are sustainably designed and ※truly affordable§, and the financing is in place. But securing land on which to build the development at a viable price is nigh-on impossible.※We can＊t compete with a developer that is coming in just to do a really big tower and isn＊t thinking about any of these things,§ she said. ※So we just won＊t win sites and we won＊t be doing these developments.§Corinne Swain, a planning specialist at Arup, urged people to consider green space as more than just parks and recreation grounds 每 , veg-patches on rooftops, even plant-strewn ※green scaffolding§ can bring nature and greenery to urban neighbourhoods. ※There are benefits in terms of noise mitigation and air pollution too,§ said Swain.For Tom Platt at advocacy group Living Streets, ※walkability§ trumps a verdant park or pretty canal any day. ※Green access is important for people＊s health, but the biggest health impact streets and green access have is in enabling physical activities,§ he argued.For cities to become more pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly, their streets need to be wrested back from the automobile. That won＊t be easy. Cars increasingly dominate our lives and the ※political difficulty§ of restricting people＊s access to private transport is substantial, Platt said.Yet it＊s not impossible to reverse the tide. Copenhagen, for example, now has . Bioregional, meanwhile, has designed a residential development in south London suburbia where car-parking and road space are radically restricted. Because people walk rather than drive, opportunities for them to bump into one another have increased, said Riddlestone. Historically, the job of designing cities has fallen to planning departments, local authorities and a host of other government agencies and organisations 每 and all attendees agreed the state must continue to set the goalposts. Yet making our cities liveable isn＊t just the government＊s job. While social enterprises such as the  and  (both of which enable local people to share everyday items) are helping engineer sociability into our cities, property developers have a key role to play. King said Lendlease now sees communal spaces in apartment blocks as ※essential§ and rooftop allotments are considered in all new developments. Despite the positives, the disconnect between the drive for profits and the need for affordable housing remains a concern. Seb Klier, London campaigns manager at Generation Rent, criticised the desperate lack of business investment in social housing and the ability of private landlords to evict renters at short notice: ※We＊ve got a massive growing population of private renters and we do need some sort of policy change to ensure that security of tenure is there for these people.§Klier suggested reintroducing long-term or even lifetime tenures would be a positive step and urged the government to ※think very strongly§ about how land owned by the state could be used to maximise affordable housing."																																																			
"The Indian government has declared severe levels of toxic air pollution in  an ※emergency situation§ as administrators announce a plan to temporarily shut construction sites and a coal-fired power station to bring the situation under control.Schools in the capital will be closed for three days and traffic may be rationed, following  and concentrations of harmful particles so high they cannot be measured by most air quality instruments.The level of PM2.5 pollutants, which are the most harmful because they can reach deep into the lungs and breach the , have reached at least 999 in parts of the city this week, more than 16 times the safe limit of 60.On Sunday, Delhi＊s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, announced emergency measures aimed at protecting residents, including a five-day ban on construction and demolition, thought to be a major contributor to pollution levels.Bulldozers are to be used to put out fires at the Bhalswa landfill, which constantly smoulders.Kejriwal said: ※People should stay home as much as they can [and] work from home.§A coal-fired power station in Badarpur, south-east Delhi, will stop operating for 10 days, along with diesel generators in the city.Kejriwal has called on neighbouring states to enforce laws against burning agricultural waste.Around this time each year, hundreds of thousands of farmers in Haryana and Punjab set their fields on fire to dispose of crop remnants, sending smoke billowing across India＊s northern plains.The Delhi government is preparing to reintroduce a temporary scheme to only allow cars to  depending on the last digit of their registration numbers.Airborne pollution in Delhi rarely stays within safe levels, even during summer, when winds are stronger and dust and droplets disperse more easily in the hot air.It is traditionally worst in the winter months, beginning with Diwali, when hundreds of thousands of fireworks are let off across the city. They leave a haze that usually , but has persisted for almost a week this year.The Centre for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based NGO, has said the air quality is the worst the Indian capital had seen in 17 years.Hospitals in the city have reported increased admissions of people suffering respiratory diseases 每 of which  has the highest rate in the world, with 159 deaths per 100,000 people in 2012, according to the World Health Organisation.Children are particularly vulnerable, a  finding about half the city＊s 4.4 million schoolchildren had stunted lung development and would never completely recover.Arti Maria, an associate professor of paediatrics at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital  the air was ※killing presently§. ※[The] presence of even little smoke is considered harmful for newborn and toddlers. The air quality right now can lead to slow brain development, mental irritation and psychological problems,§ she said.Businesses are reportedly suffering as a result of this week＊s fog and the low visibility was blamed for a  a major Delhi expressway on Thursday.The city struggled with poor air quality in the 1990s but managed to clear its atmosphere by raising emissions standards for vehicles, mandating its fleet of taxis and buses use compressed natural gas and moving some heavy industry to the outskirts of the city.Other than smoke from fires in neighbouring states, the city＊s poor air is attributed to a combination of road dust, exhaust fumes, industrial emissions and open fires, including those lit by poorer residents to cook and keep warm."																																																			
"bout 70,000 tonnes of seabird are now afloat or on the wing off the shores of the British Isles. This biomass 每 roughly the same as Salisbury Cathedral 每 is made up entirely of thinking, fishing, hunting, flirting, fighting, flying, diving and feathered beauty: 8 million breeders, several million more adolescents and, by the end of the summer, armies of chicks. Perhaps 15 million creatures in all.They are here for sex, and the raising of the next generation. Eggs can＊t be laid on the sea; bird embryos breathe air through the shell and would suffocate in water.Every coastal culture on Earth has evolved a double attitude to seabirds 每 using and loving them, nurturing and killing them, experimenting with them and selling them, looking at them with awe and making toys, hats and dinner out of them. They were never merely walking or flying larders but, as the archaeologists Marcus Brittain and Nick Overton have called them, ※participants in life§, fellow beings, co-actors in the drama and struggle of existence. Stillborn children were buried on the wings of whooper swans in Mesolithic Denmark. At Isbister in Orkney, more than 600  in a bronze age tomb. In Shetland shepherds used to feed titbits to the bonxies 每 great skuas 每 that protected their lambs from sea eagles and ravens. Even now, Hebridean fishermen keep seagulls as pets in their gardens beyond the kitchen door.For generations, their mystery and power has been in their ability to come and go beyond any horizon. Now, thanks to technology 每 almost entirely fuelled by the miniaturisation drive of the mobile phone industry 每 we know what these birds do when beyond that horizon: wandering albatrosses sail five million miles in a lifetime＊s voyaging around the Southern Ocean; each puffin holds within its mind a map of the North Atlantic, tracking across it to the same unmarked parts year after year;  smell their way around their 20,000-mile migrations from northern nest sites to southern fishing grounds in a two-hemisphere life of unbroken summer.But just as science is coming to understand the seabirds, we are destroying them. By one measure, in the past 60 years they have , from about 1.5 billion to something like 500 million.The extension of the graph into the future reaches zero in about 2060. That won＊t happen 每 the seabird phenomenon is too complex, with too many unknowns and local variations. But a disaster is unfolding, and it is one we have brought on ourselves: through overfishing; the massive accidental catching of birds in fishing gear; their deliberate destruction;  of birds that are defenceless because they did not evolve with the introduced species (many Pacific birds literally cannot smell a rat); pollution by oil, metals, plastics and other toxins; the recently discovered fact that plastic that has long been floating in the ocean comes to smell like food, so ; the destruction of nesting sites by human development; and the multiple effects of climate change and the .The . Fulmars and other species are being ; they are drowning in gill nets, which hang in the sea and are designed to trap fish by the gills but are just as effective at catching birds; and they are being killed under the heavy cables behind trawlers, where they gather to feed on offal. In European seas,  over the past 30 years. They are predicted to crash by the same percentage again in the next 50.It is the . They will be 80% down by the second half of this century, and a rare sight anywhere south of the northernmost islands in Scotland. The tufted and horned puffins, of which there are about five million in the Pacific, are also declining. Their cousins, the guillemots and razorbills, are suffering too, with , one of the headquarters of auk life, with big colonies losing almost half their birds in the three or four years after 2005. There are now some 20 million kittiwakes strung around the northern hemisphere, but in places the population has halved in number since 1983.What is to be done? All that can be done. We must not preside over the ending of these marvels. Most of the practicalities are obvious: there needs to be a much wider understanding of the state of the world＊s seabirds; their breeding places need to be protected from people and their predatory animals; much tighter controls must be imposed on all kinds of fishing vessels so that fewer birds are killed at sea; and, because the death rate of adult birds in winter has more influence on seabird populations than any other single factor, their winter feeding grounds need to be understood, mapped and protected 每 particularly the great oceanic upwellings off the continents.Finally, and most intractably, the rate at which we are changing the atmosphere and the ocean, both its temperature and its acidity, needs to be brought under control. Donald Trump＊s relighting of the fires under global warming is to be accompanied by the cutting of funds to the US nature agencies. In the UK, groundbreaking censuses of seabirds were made in 1970, 1985 and 2000. There should have been one in 2015, but shamefully it was thought unnecessary and never carried out. The destruction will romp into the future. And unless we change our minds, it will also happen in the dark."																																																			
"reathing is given remarkably little air time. But a  worldwide emerged from the World Health Organisation recently, linking 3 million deaths a year to air pollution.It＊s enough to keep you indoors. Unfortunately there＊s declining air quality inside, too, particularly from concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

"uring the course of my presidency, I made climate change a top priority, because I believe that, for all the challenges that we face, this is the one that will define the contours of this century more dramatically perhaps than the others. No nation, whether it＊s large or small, rich or poor, will be immune from the impacts of climate change. We are already experiencing it in America, where some cities are seeing floods on sunny days, where wildfire seasons are longer and more dangerous, where in our arctic state, Alaska, we＊re seeing rapidly eroding shorelines, and glaciers receding at a pace unseen in modern times.Over my eight years in office, we dramatically increased our generation of clean energy, we acted to curtail our use of dirty energy, and we invested in energy efficiency across the board. At the 2015 climate change summit in Paris, we helped lead the world to  for a low-carbon future.But here＊s the thing: even if every country somehow puts the brakes on emissions, climate change would still have an impact on our world for years to come. Our changing climate is already making it more difficult to produce food, and we＊ve already seen shrinking yields and spiking food prices that, in some cases, are leading to political instability. And when most of the world＊s poor work in agriculture, the stark imbalances that we＊ve worked so hard to close between developed and developing countries will be even tougher to close. The cost will be borne by people in poor nations that are least equipped to handle it. In fact, some of the refugee flows into Europe originate not only from conflict, but also from places where there are food shortages, which will get far worse as climate change continues. So if we don＊t take the action necessary to slow and ultimately stop these trends, the migration that has put such a burden on Europe already will just continue to get worse.Now, the good news is that there are steps we can take that will make a difference: in the United States, we have been able to bring our emissions down even as we grow our economy. The same is true in many parts of Europe. Take food production, for instance. It＊s the second leading driver of greenhouse gas emissions, second only to energy production. But we have already identified ways in which we can address this challenge. The path to a sustainable food future will require unleashing the creative power of our best scientists, and engineers and entrepreneurs, backed by public and private investment, to deploy new innovations in climate-smart agriculture. Better seeds, better storage, crops that grow with less water, crops that grow in harsher climates, mobile technologies that put more agricultural data 每 including satellite imagery and weather forecasting and market prices 每 into the hands of farmers, so that they know when to plant and where to plant, what to plant and how it will sell.All these things can help to make sure that food security exists in poor countries, but it can also help us ensure that, in producing the food that we need to feed the billions of people on this planet, we＊re not destroying the planet in the process.A part of this is also going to be wasting less food. We have to create a food culture that encourages a demand for healthier, more sustainable food. In fact, making sure people have healthy food to eat alleviates a lot of the medical cost that we＊re seeing increasing in the advanced world, and if we＊re able to reduce our healthcare costs, that in turn will allow us to divert those resources into further relieving poverty in many parts of the world. When families get the nourishment they need, we see education outcomes rise, we see healthcare costs fall, and we see economic activity improve; and when, in the United States, the number one disqualifier for military service is obesity, we might even be able to strengthen our security as well.So the good news is that we＊re starting to see a better way to feed a growing planet, combat hunger and malnutrition, put healthy food on the table and save our environment. And none of this is impossible. We can look at the successes we＊ve already made: in just the past decade, the number of undernourished people in the world is .I do not believe that any part of the world has to be condemned to perpetual poverty and hunger. And I do not believe that this planet is condemned to ever-rising temperatures. I believe these are problems that were caused by man, and they can be solved by man.I＊m fond of quoting the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who believed that there is such a thing as being too late. When it comes to climate change, the hour is almost upon us. If we act boldly and swiftly, if we set aside our political interests in favour of the air that our young people will breathe, and the food they will eat, and the water they will drink; if we think about them and their hopes and dreams, then we will act, and it won＊t be too late. And we can leave behind a world that is worthy of our children, where there＊s reduced conflict and greater cooperation 每 a world marked not by human suffering, but by human progress.ood has not been the focus of climate change discussions as much as it should have been. Part of the problem is that we haven＊t publicised the impact of food production on greenhouse gas emissions. People naturally understand that big smokestacks have pollution in them 每 they understand air pollution, so they can easily make the connection between energy production and greenhouse gases. Most people aren＊t as familiar with the impact of cows and methane. So part of the problem that we need to address is just lack of knowledge in the general public. Keep in mind how long it took to educate people around climate change, and we still have a lot of work to do.Part of it is that food is a very emotional issue. Because food is so close to us, and it＊s part of our families, and it＊s part of what we do every single day, people are more resistant to the idea of government or bureaucrats telling us how to eat, what to eat, how to grow it. The truth is that agriculture communities in every country are very strong, politically. Historically, in the United States, the one area where Democrats and Republicans agree is on the agriculture committee, because they usually come from agricultural states, and they are very good at joining across party lines to protect the interest of food producers.If you combine all those things with the fact that the system is so uneven 每 there are countries that just need more food, and there are countries where there is a glut of food 每 it makes for a difficult political dynamic in which to shape rational policy. Now, having said that, this is an area where we are starting to see some progress. In the United States, one of the things that we tried to do is to work with farmers to think about how they could produce the same amounts of food more efficiently, with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. And what I＊ve always said is that if you want to make progress in this area, you have to take into account the interests of the producers themselves. Farmers work hard, and especially with small farms, or family farms, they feel that they are always just a step away from losing everything.Obviously, a large portion of agriculture is dominated by agribusiness, but to the extent that you can show small- and medium-sized farmers ways to do things better that will save them money 每 or at least doesn＊t cost them money 每 they＊re happy to adopt some of these new processes. But if what they see is that you are putting the environmental issues as a priority over their economic interest, then they＊ll resist.That＊s true in advanced countries, and it＊s also true in poor countries. My father is from Kenya. The first time I visited, I was speaking to some conservationists who were very upset because some of the game parks were being encroached upon by farmers 每 either the Maasai with their cattle, or subsistence farmers who were slashing and cutting down the ecosystem. And my sister 每 who＊s from Kenya and has a less romantic view about animals and game parks 每 said: ※Well, if all the money from the game parks is going to the tour agencies in Nairobi and not going to the farmers next door, then of course they are not going to care. But if they see some economic interest in helping to conserve this land, they＊ll participate.§ And that, in fact, has been the case. Where you＊ve seen success in conservation, it＊s because you＊ve brought in the local farmers and you＊ve taught them how this is better for them. So that has to be a top priority. If we＊re going to be successful, we have to engage producers.We also have to engage consumers. My good friend  cooked for us at the White House, and helped to shape America＊s nutrition policy. He worked with my wife to promote healthy eating, and most of the impact he had was not legislation, it was raising awareness with parents about what unhealthy eating was doing to their children, and showing how millions of young children could eat healthier meals. The key is giving people good information. We can make progress in educating the advanced world about the need to reduce, just for dietary reasons, the amount of meat that people consume at any given meal, particularly if it＊s wasted. When you have fresh food, you are less likely to waste it, because it doesn＊t last as long 每 you buy it on the day that you are going to eat it and you use it. We＊re seeing businesses in the United States trying to come up with efficient, smart ways in which people can have the convenience of fast food, but with the food being healthier, and as a consequence, less is wasted.f people feel as if they don＊t have control over their lives, or that their children don＊t have a good future, then they will resist efforts to deal with climate change because right now they＊re concerned about feeding their child. It＊s a luxury to worry about climate change; you have to have enough to eat before you start worrying about what＊s going to happen to the planet 30 years from now. If we do not pay attention to increasing inequality 每 and the fact that technology and globalisation are accelerating 每 there will be a backlash.Technology is making many sectors of the economy far more capital-intensive and far less labour-intensive. We saw it in manufacturing, but it is now moving through large portions of the service and managerial sectors as well. This is going to be a major problem in the advanced world, and over the long term, in the developing world as well. It＊s one of the things I worry about most, because work does not just provide income 每 it also provides people with a sense of dignity and status in their society. I am certain that in many countries in the Middle East, for example, or in south Asia, part of the problem that leads to radicalisation and conflict is having large numbers of unemployed young men who don＊t have anything to do 每 that lack of meaning and purpose will channel itself in unhealthy ways.The best example of the kinds of issues that we＊re going to face comes from . Driverless cars are coming. The technologies are here and eventually the regulatory barriers are going to break down. The truth is that we can create a system of driverless cars that are safer, more fuel-efficient, and more convenient. But in the United States alone, there are 3 or 4 million people who make good livings just driving. And where are they going to work, if suddenly trucking and buses no longer need drivers? We have to anticipate those things now.My guess is that, ultimately, what is going to happen is that everybody is going to have to work a little bit less, and we＊re going to have to spread work around more. But that＊s going to require a reorganisation of the social compact. That requires that we change our mindset about the link between work, income and the value of people in the teaching profession, or healthcare, or certain things that cannot be done by AI or a robot. And one of my goals as president 每 one of the goals of every leader of every country right now 每 was thinking about that time 20 years from now, or 30 years from now, when technology will have eliminated entire sectors of the economy.How do we prepare for that? How do we start creating, or at least having a conversation in our society about making sure that work and opportunities are spread, and that everybody has the chance to live a good and fulfilling life, rather than having a few people who are working 80 or 90 hours a week, and making enormous incomes, and then a large portion of redundant workers that increasingly have a difficult time supporting families. That＊s not a sustainable mechanism for democracy and a healthy society.he people who know me best would say I have not changed much since I became president. And I＊m happy about that. One of the dangers of being in the public eye, being in the spotlight, being in positions of power, is how it will change your soul. There is an expression: you start ※believing your own hype§ 每 you start believing that you deserve all the attention. I actually found that I became more humble the longer I was in office. But I also think that I became less fearful. When you are young, you feel like you have something to prove, and sometimes you worry about making mistakes. Once you＊ve been president of the United States, then a) you＊ve made a mistake every day; b) everybody has seen you fail, and large portions of the country think you＊re an idiot 每 but it＊s a liberating feeling when you realise, ※OK, I＊m still here, I still wake up every day, and I still have the opportunity to do some good§, so that as time went on, I got rid of some of the anxieties that come with youth.When I was president, wherever I＊d go, I would always meet with young people. And it would always give me energy and inspiration to see how much talent and sophistication and optimism and idealism existed among young people in the United States, all across Europe, all across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The problem is that so often, young people＊s voices aren＊t heard, and when they want to get involved in issues, they don＊t know how, and they don＊t have the tools.So I and others have been talking about how we can create an effective network of global activists 每 some of whom are in politics, some of whom are in business, some of whom are in journalism or working for NGOs 每 and provide them with the tools, the training, the networks, the relationships, the funding, so that they can be even more effective. That＊s probably what I＊m going to be spending most of the next 10 years on. I have a lot of grey hair now. People always ask me, ※Oh, Mr President, you know, we need you, we want you to get involved§, and I＊m happy to get involved, but the greatest thing I think I can give is to make sure that somebody who is 20 years old, or 21, or 25 每 who is ready to make their mark on the world 每 I can help them, so that they can take it to the next level.When I was young, I gave my mother a lot of headaches. I wasn＊t always the best student, and I wasn＊t always the most responsible young person. It wasn＊t until I got to college that I began to think about many of the broader issues that the world was facing, but the moment for me in which I started to understand leadership was when I moved to Chicago. I had been inspired by the civil rights movement, and I wanted to be involved in some way in bringing about change. I got a job working with low-income communities, and what I learned was that the mark of a good leader is somebody who is able to empower other people. So often we think of leadership as somebody at the top who is ordering other people around. But it turns out that 每 for me, at least 每 what made me understand leadership was when I could see somebody who thought they didn＊t have a voice, or that they didn＊t have influence or power, and teach them how they could speak up about the things that were affecting their lives.When we think about issues like food security or climate change, ultimately politicians can help guide policy. But the energy to bring about change is going to come from what people do every day. It＊s going to come from parents who are concerned about the kind of impact climate change may have on their children, or from enlightened business people who say: ※How can we use less energy in producing the products that we are making?§ It＊s millions of decisions that are being made individually that end up having as much impact as anything, and that＊s certainly true in our democracies.People have a tendency to blame politicians when things don＊t work. But, as I always tell people, you get the politicians you deserve. And if you don＊t vote and you don＊t participate and you don＊t pay attention, then you＊ll get policies that don＊t reflect your interests.e have an expression in the United States: ※The squeaky wheel gets the oil.§ It＊s certainly true that politicians and governments respond to people making noise and making demands, and sometimes, if certain groups have not been heard before, they have to get the attention of those in power.But the biggest mistake sometimes made by activists 每 when I was an activist, sometimes I made this mistake 每 is forgetting that once you＊ve got the attention of the people in power, then you have to engage them. So you have to do your homework and you have to have facts, and you have to be willing to compromise and not expect that you＊re going to get 100% of what you want, because 每 at least if you＊re in a democracy 每 your demands may clash with the demands of someone else. It＊s very important to be willing to put pressure on government but it＊s also important to propose concrete solutions, to take what you can get and then try to make more progress after that.The second thing that is increasingly important is how to shape public opinion. It is very important for people who are interested in issues like climate change or inequality, or whatever it is that you care about, to find effective ways to speak to the public and to change public opinion. Abraham Lincoln used to say: ※With public opinion there＊s nothing I cannot do, and without public opinion there＊s nothing I can get done.§ And I＊ve learned that first-hand myself.We need to find ways to speak to young people who are getting all their information off a phone, and will not sit down and read a 50-page report. You may have two minutes to get your message across, or five minutes, and they may be more interested in a video than they are in reading a text. You＊ll need to create a strong, truthful, powerful message that leads them to action 每 that＊s something I＊m going to be spending a lot of time thinking about.Young people are more conscious today, they are more innovative, they are more entrepreneurial. Because they are more sceptical of government and politics, it seems as if a lot of people think: ※That＊s a dirty business, I don＊t want to go into it, who wants to be criticised and attacked all the time?§ So you＊re seeing a lot of people who want to change the world thinking that maybe the best way to do it is by going into business or non-profit organisations.If I were an entrepreneur today, trying to make money and sell my products or services, I would want to understand this youth market. They want to do the right thing, too. If they find out that what you＊re selling isn＊t good for the environment, or what you＊re selling is not good for people, or if they hear that you do not treat your workers well, and do not pay them a decent wage, and don＊t provide decent benefits, that can affect your brand. And so part of what has changed is the nature of the entrepreneurs themselves, who may be more socially conscious, coming into their business. Even if you don＊t care about these issues, your customers care. And you＊ve got to be paying attention to that.

" lot has happened since Nicholas Stern, then a permanent secretary at the Treasury, produced his  of the impact of climate change 10 years ago. His work was quickly recognised as the definitive account of the economic dangers posed to the planet by global warming.Since then, global temperatures have risen to record levels. Arctic summer sea ice has continued to shrink, as have many major land-based ice sheets. Carbon dioxide is being pumped into the atmosphere in ever-increasing amounts. At the same time, low-lying coastal areas, and parts of Bangladesh, are experiencing more and more flooding as sea levels have risen. Scientists have begun to link extreme weather events to the planet＊s changing climate, while animal and plant species are gradualling moving towards the poles. So, a decade on, is Stern plunged in despair over our prospects? Not quite. While the picture is certainly grim, the world＊s top climate economist still believes there are grounds for modest optimism.※We have been too slow in acting on climate change,§ he told the . ※In particular, we have delayed the curbing of greenhouse gas emissions for far too long. When we published our review, emissions were equivalent to the pumping of 40-41bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year. Today there are around 50bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. At the same time, science is telling us that impacts of global warming 每 like ice sheet and glacier melting 每 are now happening much more quickly than we anticipated.§In his report, published in October 2006, Stern warned that the cost of inaction would be far greater for future generations than the costs of actions taken today. ※With hindsight, I now realise that I underestimated the risks. I should have been much stronger in what I said in the report about the costs of inaction. I underplayed the dangers.§These are stark remarks. Yet the dramatic success of the  last year, and their subsequent rapid ratification by more than 90 countries, has provided the 70-year-old economist with a sense of hope: ※It has taken only 11 months to get the Paris agreement ratified. It took eight years to get its predecessor, the , into force. So in a sense, the last 12 months have been encouraging.§In his review, Stern made a cogent case for the need to make drastic reductions in fossil fuel burning to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, which are heating our atmosphere dangerously. The costs involved 每 in investing in the development of alternative energy sources, for example 每 would be far outweighed by the costs of coping with an overheated world afflicted by flooding, soaring temperatures, ruined crops and farmland, lack of food and displaced people, he argued. Most experts responded positively to the review.Yet the world is still burning more and more fossil fuel and pumping more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has both long- and short-term consequences. ※Apart from raising carbon levels and temperatures, burning fossil fuels causes air pollution, as we have learned over the past five years,§ says Stern. ※The consequences are terrible. Air pollution kills more than 30,000 people a year in Britain. That is about one in 2,000 of the population. It has become one of the very big killers around the world. In China, it causes about 4,000 deaths a day.※We are killing millions every year from air pollution produced by burning fossil fuels. Yes, there are other sources of air pollution but burning fossil fuels is a large part of the story. That understanding is new and very important.§As a counterbalance, Stern points to the fact that in recent years there has been an encouraging increase in the use of sustainable technologies that should help us to wean us of our fossil fuel dependency. Cities like Barcelona and Bogot芍 have made themselves cleaner and healthier. Coal burning has peaked in China. Hybrid cars and electric vehicles are being sold in increasing numbers and the cost of making solar panels has been reduced by a factor of 20. ※We have reached the point where we can now see that the alternative route is not really something that should be regarded as a cost. It is actually a much better way of doing things, even if you had never heard of climate change,§ says Stern.But the message has taken too long to sink in, and as result we are approaching a crunch point, he argues. In the next 20 years, as economies across the globe expand, the planet is likely to build infrastructure 每 roads, buildings, ports and airports 每 that will more than double what already exists.The crucial issue is the nature of that infrastructure. ※If it is dirty and high carbon, it will lock us into that technology for a long time. We will be sentenced to live in cities where we cannot breath or move or be productive. If we do it using sustainable technology, however, we could have an extremely attractive future where you have strong growth, poverty is reduced, cities are cleaner and forests are saved. People have not sufficiently understood the importance of the next 20 years. They are going to be the most decisive two decades in human history.§Last year＊s Paris climate deal suggests there is a will to avoid the worst and there is a prospect of further strong agreements being reached at this month＊s . India, China and the US have all made positive noises. Hillary Clinton is a firm supporter of climate change initiatives 每 but what if Donald Trump is elected president? This is a man who has claimed the concept of global warming was created ※by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive§ and who has pledged to tear up the Paris agreement. Stern＊s response is diplomatic: ※It would make things very much more difficult,§ he says.Closer to home, Stern says he is confident the government understands the importance of adhering to its commitments to reduce UK carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050 每 despite the ※policy wobbles§ of the previous administration. David Cameron pledged his would be the greenest government ever but ended up cutting support for solar panels on homes, killing the  to help people insulate old homes, scrapping green building standards for new homes and cutting support for industrial solar projects. ※To behave in an unpredictable way, as the government did last year, is to be really damaging to investment,§ says Stern. ※That is why it was worrying. But I am hopeful, though I cannot be sure, that the new administration will take a more balanced and predictable approach. It should certainly be at the core of the new government＊s industrial strategy and I will be looking for hints of that in the chancellor＊s autumn statement.§The  is a more complex issue, however. Analysis suggests the country could just about deal with the extra emissions produced by the additional planes, and still cut its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 每 if there is a major improvement in aviation technology. This would involve developing more efficient engines, better biofuels and lighter planes. ※However, that commitment to reduce emissions by 80% was made in order to hold global temperature rises to 2C. The Paris climate deal suggested we should be more ambitious and go for a 1.5C limit. That means that if the UK＊s targets are altered 每 as I believe they should be 每 to reflect the Paris agreement, there is now a question about whether we can have that extra runway and the extra carbon emissions it will generate. We need to check again if it is manageable,§ adds Stern.The Paris agreement remains central to Stern＊s sense of cautious optimism. ※It was the honesty of the delegates＊ awareness of the nature of the problem and the speed of the agreement＊s ratification that has given me most hope. We have a lot to do to limit carbon emissions to an effective level. I am confident that it is possible to achieve that, though I cannot say that I am confident it will happen.§"

"t＊s a time of year for waiting and listening. The are already here; they turned up mid-March, tumbling in off the Africa-Yorkshire flyway and filling the leafless beech tops with their chiming .Now I＊m waiting for the .

On the river, our kingfishers are renewing their pair-bond, chasing one another through the shadows of the rosebay. From the deeps of the young woodland, I hear, or half hear, another song 每 muttered and scratchy, punctuated with crackpot whistles. I only hear it once. This isn＊t where  blackcaps usually hang out 每 they prefer the holly and hedgerow further upriver 每 but this, I think, is one. It must be a wintering blackcap, one of the continental contingent that comes over from Germany or Austria just as our summer birds are shipping out for the warm south. They spend the winter battening on our bird tables. But the bird＊s singing won＊t serve much purpose here; these  (monk warblers) wait until they＊re back home before they stake out territory and breed. It is easy to forget how much practice goes into bird song. Here, I think I＊ve eavesdropped on a run-through, a warm-up.

"The purchase of highly polluting diesel cars in the UK should be discouraged with a tax of up to ?5,000 to help tackle the  of air pollution, . The policy could be particularly important following the UK＊s vote to leave the European Union, which until now has set most pollution rules.Drivers of polluting cars should also have to pay a charge to enter cities, where air pollution is worst, the researchers from University College London (UCL) said. The revenue raised should be spent on improving public transport, cycling and walking, but not on a scrappage scheme, they said.Over 40,000 people a year die early in the UK from air pollution, with most areas suffering levels of noxious fumes well above legal limits. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a key pollutant and the Volkswagen scandal led to revelations that  on the road than in official tests.The researchers say the purchase of vehicles producing the most NO2 should be deterred by a tax of between ?3,500 and ?5,000, with today＊s average polluting cars paying ?1,100-?1,700. Paul Drummond at UCL said ministers are thought to be considering such taxes and that they should be introduced soon: ※Given the public health emergency, any action to tackle this as soon as possible is beneficial to public health.§ The registration tax on new cars is already set to change in April 2017, with cars with high carbon dioxide emissions being taxed up to ?2,000. Drummond said the NO2 tax should be added on top. EU car regulations failed to cut NO2 emissions as intended, because  in the tests, but taxes are easier to implement and adjust, he said.Action to tackle air pollution is increasing, with the government facing a  and the new mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, pledging to  (Ulez) and introduce it earlier than planned. Drummond said the Ulez currently applies only to pre-2014 cars, but should be extended to those sold afterwards, if they emit more NO2 on the road than in the official lab-based test. Unlike the registration tax, such measures deter driving polluting cars in cities.Ministers are also thinking about  and further action to . Other groups, including the centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange, have also called for .※Fumes from diesel cars kill people, however indirectly 每 even from newly-manufactured models,§ said James Nix, director of , the NGO which commissioned the UCL report.※The governing EU regulation was weak before the [Brexit] referendum and, after the vote, its future application is uncertain. Taxing diesel cars according to their NO2 emissions is an increasingly feasible way to cut air pollution,§ he said. However, Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said the focus should be on clean air zones in cities and emissions regulations. ※A registration tax looks like a national solution to what is essentially a local problem,§ he said.※There are nearly 12m diesel cars in the UK but not all are driven in towns and cities, where taxis, vans, lorries and buses are also big polluters. That＊s why properly targeted clean air zones make sense,§ Gooding said. ※We [also] urgently need to have the right technical standards in place alongside a real-world testing regime we can all trust.§The UCL research estimated that an NO2-based registration tax on diesel cars would initially raise about ?600m a year. If this was spent on better buses and trains and increasing cycling and walking, the policy would achieve a double benefit, said Drummond.But he said a scrappage scheme for older, dirtier diesels, supported by a  and , was not the best use of the money: ※It just brings forward the end of the life of vehicles that would have been off the road anyway in a couple of years.§ In April, the . mean the worst polluting diesel cars will not be allowed to be sold after 2019, with further restrictions coming in 2021 每 if those rules apply to the UK then.But even those permitted after 2021 will emit higher levels of NO2 and could still be charged up to ?580 when sold, according to the policy set out by the UCL team. The level of tax is calculated using UK government estimates of the harm to health and the environment caused by the NO2 emitted."

"The UK＊s air pollution crisis would get worse if the country votes to leave the , according to a new poll of environment professionals.The UK already has levels of air pollution above legal EU limits in many cities, resulting in 40,000 early deaths a year, while ministers are currently .The  (IEMA) polled its membership, which includes experts working for government agencies such as the Environment Agency, local authorities and large businesses, and found over half consider EU air pollution rules essential in complementing national rules, with another third saying the rules were useful.The poll, of almost 1,200 professionals, found that 48% thought standards for UK air quality would get worse if the UK left the EU, with just 4% expecting they would improve and 42% saying they would stay the same. The opinion of the experts contradicted comments from leading Vote Leave campaigner , who said the EU made it harder for the UK to tackle air pollution.He told an  on Thursday: ※Let me give you a classic example of how the EU lets us down and millions of people who are victims of air pollution.

Michelle Michot Foss, who offers skepticism about battery production for renewables, is identified as the Chief Energy Economist at the Center for Energy Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. What＊s not said is that the Energy Institute she founded at UT Austin is  by Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other fossil fuel interests including the Koch Foundation, or that she＊s a  in a natural gas company.You may notice a pattern. The very experts we assume to be objective, and the very centers of research we assume to be independent, are connected with the very industry the public believes they are objectively studying. Moreover, these connections are often kept hidden. To say that these experts and research centers have conflicts of interest is an understatement: many of them exist as they do only  of the fossil fuel industry. They are industry projects with the appearance of neutrality and credibility given by academia.After years conducting energy-related research at Harvard and MIT, we have come to discover firsthand that this pattern is systemic. Funding from Shell, Chevron, BP, and other oil and gas companies  Harvard＊s energy and climate policy research, and Harvard research directors consult for the industry. These are the experts tasked with formulating policies for countering climate change, policies that threaten the profits 每 indeed the existence 每 of the fossil fuel industry.Down the street at MIT, the Institute＊s Energy Initiative is  by fossil fuel companies, including Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron. MIT has taken  from oil billionaire and climate denial financier David Koch, who is a  of the university＊s board.The trend continues at Stanford, where one of us now works. The university＊s Global Climate and Energy Project is  by ExxonMobil and Schlumberger. The Project＊s  director is a petroleum engineer, and its  director is a reservoir engineer. Its current director also  Stanford＊s Precourt Institute for Energy, which is named after (and was  by) the  (now  by Shell). Across the bay, UC Berkeley＊s Energy Biosciences Institute is the product of a  deal with BP 每 one that gives the company power over which research projects get funded and which don＊t.Fossil fuel interests 每 oil, gas, and coal companies, fossil-fueled utilities, and fossil fuel investors - have colonized nearly every nook and cranny of energy and climate policy research in American universities, and much of energy science too. And they have done so quietly, without the general public＊s knowledge.For comparison, imagine if public health research were funded predominantly by the tobacco industry. It doesn＊t take a neurosurgeon to understand the folly of making policy or science research financially dependent on the very industry it may regulate or negatively affect. Harvard＊s school of public health  funding from the tobacco industry for that very reason. Yet such conflicts of interest are not only rife in energy and climate research, they are the norm. This norm is no accident: it is the product of a public relations strategy to neutralize science and target those whom ExxonMobil  ※Informed Influentials,§ and it comes  of Big Tobacco＊s . The myriad benefits of this strategy to the fossil fuel industry (and its effects on academic research) range from benign to insidious to unconscionable, but the big picture is simple: academia has a problem.As scientists and policy experts rush to find solutions to the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced, our institutions are embroiled in a nationwide conflict of interest with the industry that has the most to lose. Our message to universities is: stop ignoring it.We are not saying that universities must cut all ties with all fossil fuel companies. Energy research is so awash with fossil fuel funding that such a proposal would imply major changes. What we are saying is that denial 每 ※I don＊t see a conflict,§ MIT＊s Chairman  the  每 is no longer acceptable.Two parallel approaches can help. First, mandatory standards should be established in climate policy and energy research for disclosing financial and professional ties with fossil fuel interests, akin to those required in medical research. And second, conflicts of interest should be reduced by prioritizing less conflicted funding and personnel.One way or another, the colonization of academia by the fossil fuel industry must be confronted. Because when our nation＊s ※independent§ research to stop climate change is in fact dependent on an industry whose interests oppose that goal, neither the public nor the future is well served."

Firefighters have been on high-alert, sporting events have had to be cancelled and power stations have struggled to cope with the high demand as air conditioning systems run at full tilt.But it isn＊t just Australia that is feeling the heat. Climate scientists have confirmed that  of record keeping. Which is shocking given that it occurred during a La Ni?a event. We expect global temperature records to be broken during El Ni?o events (when central and eastern Pacific waters are warmer than average) but until now El Ni?o＊s cooler cousin, La Ni?a, has usually brought respite from the heat.Last year we had the extreme ※Godzilla§ El Ni?o, contributing to record breaking weather conditions all around the world. Meanwhile, in recent months we＊ve seen weak La Ni?a conditions. Now the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have confirmed that La Ni?a has slipped away and  as early as this summer. There is still a fair bit of uncertainty, but if El Ni?o does roar back this quickly we＊d better brace ourselves for yet more record breaking weather."																																																			
"It always hits me in the gut first. I often feel it first thing, my stomach twisted in a knot, my brain deciding it doesn＊t want to deal with the day before I even wake up.Sometimes my anxiety will fester around a particular thing 每 a cascade of worry about my work, health, social life, or often a simple decision I have to make. This worry becomes totally paralysing, with hours spent focusing on nothing else but this one issue. At other times the anxiety hits for no reason, a desperate feeling of dread that I cannot explain, nor wash away no matter how much I try.Over the past couple of years I＊ve come to terms with the reality of my anxiety disorder 每 moving from seeing myself as someone who has anxious moments to realising I have a mental health condition.In many ways it has been liberating, largely because in owning the illness I＊ve been able to start dealing with it. I visit a psychologist, who is doing a great job at helping me manage my anxious events. Yet at the same time, recognising this problem has also been challenging. While I＊ve been able to deal with the symptoms, I continue to struggle to find the cause 每 a process that is taking me down a rabbit hole of realisation of the depth of this illness. Consult  and you will get an increasingly clear picture of what causes the disorder.  such as a genetic predisposition, personality traits, the existence of stressful events, physical health problems and substance abuse can all lead to an anxiety disorder. , with an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and epinephrine in the brain likely being a trigger. This research provides an essential picture of the nature of  每 confirming anxiety as a core mental health issue  that we all go through. For me it has created some comfort. I have a familial history of mental health problems, and at the times when I＊m inexplicably paralysed with anxious thoughts it is often useful to tell myself that my neurotransmitters are simply firing a little funny that day. Yet it＊s also clear that anxiety disorders are something much bigger than a simple biological condition.As I＊ve become increasingly comfortable talking about my anxiety, one of the things that has been most striking has been the realisation of how common it is. For my cohort 每 Generation Y 每 it increasingly feels as though anxiety disorders are more common than not. The list I have of my friends with different forms of the disorder grows longer all the time, leading me to ask, why is it that this plagues so many of my generation?I＊ve managed to understand this by thinking about anxiety as a stressful event. As noted before, stressful life events 每 whether it is the loss of a job, the death of a family member, or the breakdown of a relationship 每 are one of the major causes of anxiety disorders. What＊s changing is that these events are becoming a continuous existence for an entire generation. Increasing , , economic and income instability, and a future of climate change, environmental destruction and conflict, have turned stress 每 and in turn anxiety 每 into a way of life.Just as significant stressful events are shown to cause anxiety disorders, research suggests that this long-term stress has a similar impact. For example,  found in 2009 that stress from job insecurity is worse for your mental health than unemployment. Similar data has been found regarding housing, with  finding a strong correlation between different forms of housing insecurity and mental health problems such as anxiety.  that when it comes to climate change we are undergoing ※a collective anxiety that is insidious, even if we haven＊t managed to connect all the dots§. But it is even more complex than this. These material conditions are met with what  每 a breakdown of communal structures that are important for our mental wellbeing. Whether it is the  or  that reduce time for social activity, we live in a society in which we are all , destroying one of the key mechanisms available to protect against mental anguish. disorders are not just medical problems. They are inherently social illnesses, ones that are becoming more of an issue as economic insecurity increases and social connections are destroyed.But herein lies the challenge. Facing this epidemic we now have a dilemma. How can we deal with these huge social causes while at the same time support and protect those who are suffering from the illness here and now? This is a fine balance, but one we have not managed to find. Michael Currie for example comments that we hardly even deal with the causes of anxiety when trying to treat it, , ※Anxiety-as-disease is treated much like an infection, as if the symptoms were a bacterium that should be eradicated.§ NGO campaigns are very similar, with awareness programs, , working primarily in an after-the-fact approach. This is not to say that these approaches have no value. Doctors and psychologists, for example, can only deal with an illness as it is presented to them. I can say from first-hand experience these approaches are extremely useful in helping deal with the disorder.Yet, as we face this epidemic we must also confront the social conditions behind it. Economic, income, and housing insecurity, alongside the plague of social isolation, is causing a generational mental health crisis, primarily situated in anxiety disorders. Finding long-term solutions therefore can only occur when we are willing to tackle these social causes.I do not know exactly what this balance looks like. But if we really want to solve our anxiety epidemic we have to think of solutions that look at the causes of the problem, and not just the symptoms. Otherwise we face a whole generation or more plagued by this illness."																																																			
"Patrick Barkham＊s remarks on garden decking and wildlife loss (, 7 March) chime with research we undertook on the changes to garden vegetation in London over an eight-year period. We found that between 1998-99 and 2006-07, 3,000 hectares of vegetation disappeared from gardens, replaced by hard standing and decking. This loss, equivalent to 2.5 Hyde Parks each year, was compounded by the loss of 1m trees from gardens.?

"It＊s great you are giving this so much thought, but you are looking, pretty much, at the worst-case scenario. And that did make me wonder, if you did have children, if you would always look at every event or outing they went on, like this.

I wondered whether it was easier to acknowledge your longing for them, than be able to acknowledge your longing for a child of your own?§ I also wondered about a sense of loss at your sister emigrating and what you felt that left you with? We were struck by how ※alone you seem in this decision. While it sounds as if your partner finds uncertainty unsettling, you will be parenting together and one of the first acts of parenting is making the choice to have the baby together.§Deciding to have the baby is really only the first big step you take together as parents 每 will you also be alone in the others, having to ※present a position§ to your partner? I wondered 每 and I say this really tentatively 每 if this wasn＊t just a question of having children, but having children with this man? You made no hint of this and it＊s sheer conjecture on my part, but it is something I feel is worth mentioning. There is very much just one viewpoint coming from your letter. Perhaps your partner could actually give you some perspective on this? If he really can＊t, will you in effect be, emotionally, parenting solo?The fact that you are ambivalent is incredibly sensible. The choice to have a child is a big one, but because it＊s so big, it＊s easy to paralyse oneself by the negative what-ifs. What is harder to factor in, to imagine, are the ※wows§.※What I felt was missing from your letter is hope,§ says Johnson. ※Women get pregnant in all sorts of desperate circumstances and in doing so, either consciously or unconsciously, they are choosing life over potential death. I wonder whether, on some level, your worry about climate change is a cover for some deeper ambivalence.§Obviously no one can make this decision for you (both), but Johnson suggests: ※I wonder if, in making your decision, it might help you to move from the global to the personal, and explore the areas that you have more control over: for instance, how does the thought of creating space in your life for a child feel? What would it mean for your career or your relationship?§I also think that, to really come to a decision that is right for you you need to think not only of what happens if you do have a child, but also what it means for you if you don＊t. ※How would you feel,§ asks Johnson, ※if you decided not to have a child, and action on climate change did keep the global temperature at safe levels?§Ultimately, try to forget about everything else for a moment and think: ※Where do I want to be in 10 years and who do I want to be with me?§ Really, that bit is all you have any control over.Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU, or email annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

" companies have been hit by a series of record fines for major sewage leaks and other pollution incidents. Water was fined ?1.1m for illegally discharging sewage that polluted the river Ouse near York, while Thames Water was fined ?1m for repeated sewage leaks into the Grand Union canal.The financial penalties have soared after a change in sentencing guidelines, but it is too early to tell if the number of pollution offences by water companies is falling.  that the most persistent and frequent polluters of England＊s rivers and beaches were the nation＊s 10 biggest water companies. They committed more than 1,000 incidents between 2005-13 but were fined a total of only ?3.5m, a sum described as ※pitiful§ by a senior MP at the time.However,  made the penalties more severe in July 2014 and the eight biggest fines alone since then come to a total of over ?5m.※These sorts of significant fines, which all large companies can now face for causing serious environmental damage, should act as a deterrent and help us better protect the environment and the public,§ said Anne Brosnan, chief prosecutor at the . ※Pollution incidents can impact on local communities, reduce water quality and spoil ecosystems. While water quality has improved dramatically over the last decade there is more to do.§※The courts have basically added a nought,§ said a source close to the issue. ※Once it gets to that level, the boards and shareholders of water companies start to take notice.§ Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said: ※Tougher penalties also increases the risk of reputational damage, which can be another important deterrent.§Alex Cunningham, the shadow water minister, said: ※As a public service utility, the cash-rich water industry must take its responsibilities seriously. It is clear from the escalation in environmental fines that their shareholders are feeling a greater impact, but it is far from clear whether this is driving greater action.§Water companies have been frequently criticised for making billions of pounds in profits and awarding large shareholder dividends, while paying little or no corporation tax.

Furthermore, the backup pump was found to be out of operation again just over a year later, during a site inspection by the Environment Agency.A Yorkshire Water spokeswoman said: ※We accept the judgment and apologise for the pollution incident.

"Hundreds of thousands of children are being exposed to illegal levels of damaging air pollution from diesel vehicles at schools and nurseries across England and Wales, a joint investigation by the Guardian and  has revealed. The analysis of the most recent government data exposes how dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO) pollution from diesel traffic are not limited to large metropolitan centres, but threaten the health of children and young people in towns and cities from Newcastle to Plymouth.The research shows more than 1,000 nurseries which look after 47,000 babies and children are in close proximity to roads where the level of nitrogen dioxide from diesel traffic exceeds the legal limit of 40?g/m (micrograms per cubic metre of air).The findings come as the government is under pressure to dramatically improve its strategy to clean up the nation＊s air, after . Ministers have to produce new draft measures to tackle air pollution by 24 April.Chris Griffiths, professor of primary care and public health at Bart＊s and the London School of Medicine, said the findings were very important and called for a dramatic change in attitudes within society and from government. ※The research on exposure to traffic fumes and children＊s lung growth is pretty consistent. It shows that such exposure reduces lung growth, produces long term ill health and can cause premature death. We should be outraged that we are exposing our developing children to these obvious problems.§Griffiths said while 40?g/m was the legal limit in Europe, there was no safe level of exposure to diesel fumes and that areas which did not show up in the analysis could not be complacent.※Why should we tolerate this?§ said Griffiths. ※It is a relatively simple thing to try and solve. It is a choice we have to make. Rather than telling people to take their inhaler, stay indoors and reduce exercise when there are high pollution levels, attitudes need to change and we need to make the polluter pay.§ The investigation used the government＊s own pollution modelling from 2015 to identify all schools and nurseries 每 whether private, academy or state maintained 每 which are within 150 metres of a road where emissions of NO are above the legal limit. Figures for  do not include private nurseries.It found:The scale of the exposure of young children to dangerous diesel emissions is likely to be an underestimate as it is based on government modelling which has been criticised by judges as overly optimistic. Ministers will have to come up with more sensitive analysis in their draft air quality plan this month which is likely to reveal that many more children are being exposed to dirty air from diesel traffic.Anna Jones, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace, said there was a need to raise awareness around the country about dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution. She called for urgent government action with car companies to get polluting vehicles off the streets.※Most people don＊t realise that all across the country toddlers are being exposed to invisible air pollution caused by diesel vehicles,§ said Jones.※We were told diesel vehicles were the cleaner choice but car makers lied about the toxic pollution they emit. The only way to make our communities safer is to tackle air pollution head on. To fix this problem we need wholesale transformation on our roads away from diesel towards hybrid and electric vehicles. Both the government and the car companies need to work urgently to fix this.§Birmingham was the worst area outside London for children＊s exposure to diesel traffic fumes; 38 nurseries and 30 schools in the city are within 150m of a road where emissions of nitrogen dioxide exceed the legal limit.But the analysis shows smaller towns and cities 每 including Poole and Oxford 每 also suffer diesel traffic pollution problems. In the south-west coastal city of Plymouth nearly 10% of nurseries are within 150m of illegal levels of NO emissions from roads.In Nottingham 11% of nurseries are within 150m of an illegally polluting road. The school in the highest pollution pocket outside London is Widnes Academy primary school in the north-west, and the pottery town of Stoke on Trent has five nurseries and four schools close to damaging levels of air pollution.Andy Burnham, Labour＊s candidate for mayor of Greater Manchester, where 20 nurseries, schools and after school clubs are close to dangerous levels of NO emissions, said he has visited one school where pollution levels are almost three times the legal limit. ※I have urged the government to give the mayor of Greater Manchester powers to introduce a clean air zone so we can protect children and those most vulnerable from the high polluting vehicles. We also need a broader plan to reduce congestion, increase cycling and make public transport a clean, reliable and affordable alternative to the car.§Some nursery providers and headteachers had no idea their schools were in pollution hotspots.Sandra Nelson, manager of Step by Step Nursery in Bridge Avenue, Hammersmith, where road emissions levels are 107.47?g/m said: ※It＊s never been brought to my attention. If the level here is higher than what it should be I think it needs to be addressed by the local authority and the government.§Marg Randles, managing director of Busy Bees Childcare, which has eight nurseries close to illegally polluting roads, said she supported attempts to improve UK air quality.※Air quality is a concern for many communities in the UK. Undoubtedly the levels of pollution across many parts of the country have reached unacceptable levels and we understand that everyone is affected by high levels of nitrogen dioxide. Reducing the levels of pollution especially around homes, schools, hospitals and nurseries where levels are high is hugely important.§Nitrogen dioxide emissions from diesel traffic cause 23,500 of the 40,000 premature deaths from air pollution each year, according to figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. In April last year MPs said air pollution was a .A government spokesperson said: ※We are firmly committed to improving the UK＊s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. That＊s why we have committed more than ?2bn since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emissions vehicles, support greener transport schemes and set out how we will improve air quality through a new programme of Clean Air Zones.※In addition, in the autumn statement, we announced a further ?290m to support electric vehicles, low emission buses and taxis, and alternative fuels. We will update our air quality plans shortly to further improve the nation＊s air quality.§ This article was amended on 5 April 2017. An earlier version said 118.19?g/m was ※more than four times§ the legal limit (40?g/m).

"lephants have such sad expressive faces that it is hard to imagine how anyone could harm them. They have drawn lips and sagging shoulders; a long, drooping demeanour; sad, knowing eyes capable of laying on the guilt. Yet, it would appear that guilt is not enough to save them. Eighty years ago there were perhaps 6 to 9 million African and Asian elephants. Today there are roughly half a million left. Day by day, they are getting closer to extinction.Perhaps we need some new ideas. Perhaps it is time for a different perspective on why elephants need saving. Rather than their bodies, maybe it is their shared memories and experience that we might one day come to value. This is the argument that I＊d like to put forward in this piece.Let＊s start with their neural hardware. Elephant brains are enormous 每 far larger than might be expected for a creature of their size. This is partly because, like humans, their brains have been forged over many millions of years of periodic drought and starvation. The world has filled up with the individuals that are the most enduring. Those that are most adept at communicating, supporting, coordinating. Those with a good understanding of family bonds.Enhanced memory is another attribute commonly found in drought-afflicted creatures: those that remember the location of waterholes will be the ones who thrive. Natural selection favours them. And so it is that elephant brains, like ours, possess over 100bn neurons. I believe that it is this capacity for memory 每 or rather, information storage 每 that we should celebrate in elephants. The old adage that elephants never forget has more than a little truth to it.In 2007 Lucy Bates and colleagues at the University of St Andrews found that elephants in Amboseli national park in Kenya, . They found that elephants reacted more fearfully to the smell of clothes worn by a Maasai man than to those from a Kamba man. Of the two groups, the Maasai are traditional elephant hunters and upon smelling the Maasai clothes, the elephants retreated into long grass. Significantly, the research project showed young elephants with no direct experience of the Maasai reacted with similar caution when encountering their smell, or their characteristic red clothing. They knew there was something to fear, courtesy of information shared between members of the group. Elephant memories and experiences run deeper than we once thought. They can be passed around. They are almost collective. Each year we are gaining a better understanding of this collective consciousness among elephants. In 2014  found that elephants responded to recordings of humans differently according to the voice. The elephants in the study were able to differentiate between ethnicity, age and gender. Again, male Maasai were most commonly avoided by these elephants. They responded with anxiety to the sound of their voices. They made a judgment call, based on their own experiences or the actions of those around them, to run for cover. They plugged into a hidden network of experience.It appears that older matriarchs are central to this information network 每 within their brains are memories of decades of life-saving experiences. During the 1993 drought in Tanzania＊s Tarangire national park it was the . The matriarchs remembered, it seems, where the food was during harder times, and prospered when many others didn＊t. In this way the matriarchs are invaluable. They are the data hubs, storing the solutions of generations; they are who younger individuals turn to in novel situations. From them, the memes of survival are incubated and accessible to others.The idea of elephants as information networks should matter to conservationists, because in this view of the world every elephant killed by humans is a network user or editor lost. With the extinction of elephants, we would also see the extinction of a network of elephant experiences 每 where the waterholes are; who to befriend and who to avoid; where the grasses come late or early; where the mud holes are plentiful and where the crocodiles are not; why it＊s a good idea to avoid men in red garments; when the moon lights the night each month; where dead friends and ancestors let out their last tortured gasps. This is network chatter. It is network traffic. It has value. We are told that elephants matter because they are spectacularly intelligent and charismatic and because they are ecosystem engineers and umbrella species, protecting the wildlife of the region. But, what if they were also worth conserving for the information architecture that their societies utilise? After all, we seek to  每 why not the experiences and group memories of elephants? This isn＊t as crazy as it sounds. There are even , so why should we pooh-pooh conserving the communal memory infrastructure of elephants? In the future, we may come to realise that elephants represent more than just skin and tusks and bones. They are mobile repositories of information. If these treasures are unseeable and incomprehensible to humans, that doesn＊t make them any less valuable or real. Many of our museums contain human knowledge and experiences, in the form of antiquities, that we struggle to read or understand. Why should this value system not apply to wild elephants (or dolphins or chimps, for that matter)?This weird thought is something conservationists might do well to consider in their battle for support. Who knows: it may be that in the future, the death of a user-generated network might be considered more harrowing than the death of a living creature. This might be the start of a prosperous conservation campaign funded by big tech: ※Elephants 2.0: conserving in the wild, a unique and unseeable internet of alternative experience.§ I can see it now: Nobel prizes, TED talks ＃Imagine it: elephants saved not by governments and wildlife conservationists but by a fleet of IT geeks with a love of flowcharts and network nodes. An elephant information network saved in the wild, with a single flex of the muscular biceps of the Silicon Valley glitterati.

Last week, the new UN secretary-general, Ant車nio Guterres, warned the Trump team if the US disengages from too many issues confronting the international community it will be replaced as world leader.On climate change, Merkel has prepared the ground carefully, hosting in Berlin the two allies she most needs 每 the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang.China is the single largest emitter of carbon, and  the third. If they followed America in rejecting the Paris agreement, the whole process would unravel. Both countries have said they will not pull out of the treaty, and will beat their Paris commitments. insists it is not seeking confrontation at the summit. Sigmar Gabriel, the German foreign minister, points out there will be many far more rightwing governments present in Hamburg than Trump, and they will receive far less obloquy from the expected tens of thousands of street protesters.Nor does he pretend his country wishes to set itself up as a rival to America, saying Germany has got enough responsibilities already. ※As German foreign minister, you wake up in the morning with a demand for leadership, and in the evening you go to bed with it,§ Gabriel said.Merkel is reluctant to be cast in the role of leader of western liberal vales, although a poll published last week by Pew Research found Merkel＊s favourability ratings on the rise, especially on the left, with an impressive 52% of all Europeans surveyed confident she would ※do the right thing in world affairs§.But the G7, and Trump＊s subsequent decision to shun the Paris climate change treaty, clearly left a permanent mark on her, leading to her famous declaration of independence four days later at a Christian Social Union (CSU) rally in a Bavarian beer tent. In remarks seen in the US as marking a new chapter in the trans-European alliance, she said: ※The times in which we could completely rely on others are over to a certain extent. That is what I experienced in the last few days. That is why I can only say: We Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands.§European voters＊ decisions to give a commanding parliamentary majority to Emmanuel Macron, and not to provide the same to Theresa May, will have confirmed Merkel＊s belief that  once again can be master of its own fate.The fact that the only country Trump will visit in Europe before the G20 is Poland 每 the bad boy of Europe and its greatest carbon emitter 每is symbolic of a president uneasy with Europe＊s new confidence. Poland and Trump also both oppose Russia＊s Nord Stream 2 pipeline, due to double the amount of gas being sent from Russia to Germany.On protectionism, Merkel was blunt in speaking to German business this week about her belief in open markets. ※We＊ll do all we can to get as broad an agreement on this as possible in Hamburg. Given the new American administration that＊s not easy, but nonetheless we need to make the effort.§But Europe＊s leaders are not the only ones re-evaluating their relationship with the US. The Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, told her parliament last week the fact that the US, under its new administration, ※has come to question the very worth of its mantle of global leadership§, means Canada, like other countries, must ※set our own clear and sovereign course§. Australia＊s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, in March claimed many regional partners were locked in a ※strategic holding pattern§, waiting to see where Trump will go.Argentina, the next host of the G20, has also told Trump that it has tried isolation and it does not work.So at the broadest level, the G20 summit will be a first test of whether other leaders can, or indeed want to, escape from America＊s shadow.But it is Merkel＊s compact for Africa that most animates her, according to foreign ministers that have seen her recently.Merkel fears that long term demographic trends mean 100 m Africans could come to Europe driven by climate change, poverty, and Europe is wholly unprepared.Combating poverty upstream in Africa as a way to stem the mass migrant flow to Europe downstream is her guiding idea. Her specific initiative is to team up African nations which have committed to economic reforms with private investors who would then bring jobs and businesses."																																																			
"Children in a region of the US were born smaller after the area switched from nuclear plants to coal-fired power stations, new research has found.The study looked at of the impact of nuclear power plant closures in the aftermath of the  in Pennsylvania in 1979 每 the most serious such accident in US history 每 in which one of the power station＊s reactors underwent a partial meltdown.※At the time policymakers thought they were protecting public health by scrutinising nuclear power plants, given the partial meltdown that happened in Three Mile Island,§ said Edson Severnini, author of the research from Carnegie Mellon University in the US. ※But they didn＊t anticipate this indirect effect that happened through the relocation of electricity generation from nuclear to coal.§While the study is based on a historical incident, experts say the results are pertinent given the shift from nuclear to coal power in Japan and Germany following the  in 2011, and the eagerness of the Trump administration to embrace coal.Writing in the journal , Severnini describes how he sought to analyse a so-called ※natural experiment§ whereby a number of nuclear power plants were closed following country-wide inspections carried out after the Three Mile Island accident. Among them were Browns Ferry and Sequoyah in the Tennessee Valley area: both remained closed for several years after they were shut down in 1985.The analysis of data from the US  Information Administration by Severnini reveals that the loss of nuclear energy following the two closures was made up almost entirely by an increase in energy production by coal-fired power plants in the Tennessee Valley area, although the increase varied across different plants.The result was that particle pollution increased in areas where coal use rose. Around the Paradise plant, which accounted for almost a quarter of the rise in coal-fired energy, concentration of particulates increased by 27% in the 18 months after the nuclear shutdown.At the same time average birth weight fell. After taking into account a host of factors relating to the child, county and mother, including her age and education levels 每 although smoking habits were not specifically probed 每 birth weight in areas with coal-fired plants declined by around 5.4% in the 18 months after the nuclear shutdown. The impact was greatest in the areas which showed the greatest boom in coal-fired power plant activity after closure of the two nuclear sites.With previous research suggesting that air pollution could affect both the health of pregnant women and their unborn babies, Severnini carried out further analysis of the data, revealing that the rise in air pollution appears to be linked to both lower growth of the foetus and premature births. What＊s more, he adds, the impact on birth weight only appears to occur in babies born at least three months after the nuclear shutdown. ※If the mother is exposed only in the last three months of pregnancy it could be that the formation of the foetus is already advanced and then the effects might be lower 每 which is what I find,§ he said. But the impact, adds Severnini, goes further, with , shorter height and even a lower IQ: a drop of 5.4% in birth weight, he notes, suggests a 0.7% decrease in full-time earnings.Jonathan Griggs, professor of paediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary University of London, who was not involved in the research, said the study chimes with previous research showing the impact of . ※What makes it interesting is it is a natural experiment,§ he said of the latest research. The study, he adds, could also have important implications for the US, with the Trump administration pledging to  Marie Pederson from the Center of Epidemiology and Screening at the University of Copenhagen agreed. ※I think we have enough evidence to say we should not shift to coal-burning power plants, and really it could be good to push for more clean energy sources, not only for birth weight but for many other outcomes also,§ she said, pointing out that  has been linked to respiratory diseases such as  as well as health problems in pregnant women, including hypertension and pre-eclampsia.While exactly how air pollution acts on the foetus is unclear and requires further research, said Griggs, but he added the latest findings are troubling. ※If you have reduced organ development, both brain and other organs, our concern is that has a disproportionate effect over the whole lifespan,§ he said. ※What we want as clinicians, we want to maximise foetal development and anything that suppresses foetal development in any way is of concern.§"																																																			
"US cities will lead national policy on climate change after the Trump administration＊s  from , working to reduce emissions and become more resilient to rising sea levels, Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans said at an annual meeting in Florida. ※I think most mayors in America don＊t think we have to wait for a president§ whose beliefs on climate change are disconnected from science, Landrieu said. The US Conference of Mayors supported the Paris agreement, and according to preliminary results released on Saturday morning from an ongoing nationwide survey, the vast majority of US mayors want to work together and with the private sector to respond to climate change. ※There＊s near unanimity in this conference that climate change is real and that humans contribute to it,§ said Landrieu, who will replace Oklahoma City mayor Mick Cornett as conference president in  Beach this weekend. ※There may be a little bit of a disagreement about how actually to deal with it.※If the federal government refuses to act or is just paralyzed, the cities themselves, through their mayors, are going to create a new national policy by the accumulation of our individual efforts,§ he said.  City mayor Bill de Blasio said US cities too often find themselves alone when trying to address the effects of climate change. De Blasio joined Miami Beach mayor Philip Levine on a tour of a South Beach neighborhood where the city has raised streets and installed pumps to send up to 120,000 gallons of water a minute flowing back into Biscayne Bay.The project 每 aimed at keeping the island city dry amid rising seas 每 has received national attention, but Levine noted that not all communities can afford to fight climate change without state or federal funding. ※But if we don＊t do it, who＊s going to do it, right?§ de Blasio said. ※Cities and states around the country are now doing the kinds of things the national government should do. It＊s just that we can＊t depend on our national government anymore.§ A May survey of local sustainability efforts, conducted by the conference and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, initially only included 80 mayors who hold leadership positions within the conference. After , the survey was extended to all conference members and the mayors of about 1,400 cities with populations of 30,000 or more.Cities still have months to respond to the questionnaire on low-carbon transportation options, renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, but the data received so far from 66 cities in 30 states showed 90% were interested in forming partnerships with other local governments to create climate plans, implement transportation programs or procure equipment such as electric vehicles. The responses have come from cities ranging in size from 21,000 people 每 Pleasantville, New Jersey 每 to New York City＊s 8.5 million. According to the survey, the majority want to buy or already bought green vehicles, and most also have energy efficiency policies for new and existing municipal buildings. Traditional energy sources still dominate, but the survey noted that more cities could use renewable electricity if their states passed legislation. Forty-seven cities spent nearly $1.2bn annually on electricity for city operations, and ※with this level of purchasing power, coordinated efforts or shifts in demand from US cities will be of interest to energy utilities and provides§, the survey said.

"The federal government has dramatically lowered the safe exposure levels of toxic firefighting chemicals, following months of controversy over contaminations detected near airports and military bases.The new tolerable daily intake levels (TDIs) of the polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals 每 used in firefighting foam for decades until the early 2000s but now known to be toxic 每 are now in line with US standards, but authorities have warned the long-term effects of exposure remain unknown.PFAS contamination has been detected  near multiple Australian airports and a dozen Royal Australian Air Force bases including Townsville and Oakey in Queensland, Williamtown in New South Wales, Darwin and Katherine in the Northern Territory, and Perth.Monday＊s announcement altered the maximum TDI of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) from 150 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day to 20 nanograms. The maximum TDI of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was revised to 160 nanograms.The guideline for maximum TDI of PFOS in drinking water has been reduced by 7.5 times from 0.5 micrograms to 0.07 micrograms per litre, and from 5 micrograms to 0.56 for PFOA.The new tolerable levels, recommended by Food Standards Australia New Zealand, changed interim guidelines which had been in place since June.  rather than the 78 times lower limits set by the US just one month prior.The federal Department of  said the previous levels were not wrong, and that both sets of TDIs were protective of public health. The old TDIs were always intended to be replaced and were appropriate as an interim measure, it said.Authorities stressed the guidelines were precautionary measures while research continued, because there was no consistent evidence about the long-term effects of low-level accumulation in humans. Most investigation into the effects of PFAS, particularly overseas, relates to exposure at high levels in places where the chemicals are produced.Food Standards Australia New Zealand was contracted by the federal government as a consultant, and was also tasked to consider what regulatory options were available for food levels but was unable to justify any based on the lack of conclusive evidence and information.※So it＊s not a standard, and food can still be sold in the marketplace,§ said the  director of environmental health, Xavier Schobben.Authorities and government have acknowledged that uncertainty around the contamination as well as the lack of science on the long-term effects was causing stress in affected communities.More than 450 Oakey residents have reportedly launched a class action against the Department of Defence over the contamination, and another class action on behalf of Williamtown residents is .The Department of Health has funded programs including mental health, counselling services and voluntary blood testing in Williamtown and Oakey, where contamination has been the worst.Natasha Fyles, the Northern Territory health minister, said her government was lobbying defence to provide similar support and services to Katherine residents, the worst-affected area in the NT. Working with defence on the contamination issue had been an ※ongoing issue§, she said, but was ※cooperative§.※We remind defence that they need to certainly be at the table on this issue in terms of providing information and resources to our community. I＊m confident defence acknowledge their role to play,§ she said.In the Northern Territory the worst contamination has been in Katherine between the RAAF base and the edge of town, where more than 40 properties which rely solely on bore water have been supplied with bottled drinking water by defence.Authorities said outside of those areas, the water in Katherine 每 which relies on river water or a mix of river and bore water 每 was safe to drink.The concern for the main town was isolated to a short period of time following the end of the dry season. At that time the new rains flush the river and can bring uncontrollable levels of bacteria, forcing the town on to 100% bore water.No details of contingency plans in the event of Katherine residents being told not to drink the water were provided, but decisions would be made on the basis of further testing and consultation, members of the joint agency taskforce said on Monday.Last week the federal Labor opposition criticised the government for inadequate national coordination on responding to the crisis.An Environment Protection Authority summit is under way in Melbourne to develop a national PFAS management plan.The Department of Defence has been contacted for comment."																																																			
"Members of the Australian Medical Association have threatened to quit over comments by the national president, Dr Michael Gannon, that the impact of job losses from  should be considered as well as the health benefits.Gannon has been accused of contradicting clear AMA policy on clean air and going back on his pledge to be less political than his predecessor, but the head of Australia＊s peak medical body has denied both accusations.The AMA＊s former vice president Dr Stephen Parnis told the Doctors for the Environment Australia conference on Sunday that Gannon＊s comments were ※a wilful distortion of AMA policy§. the health benefits of closing down brown coal power plants need to be considered alongside the health impacts of unemployment and blackouts.While he said the closure of the coal-fired plant was ※good news§ for children with asthma, the elderly and people who suffered respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, ※there is also the health effects of unemployment that need to be considered§. ※The Australian Medical Association has clear positions about the risk of providing energy supply through fossil fuels and specifically the risk of brown coal, but somewhere in this we would call for common sense,§ he said.※We need stable base-load power as well, and we need grown-up conversations about gas and nuclear power while technology is developed to deliver renewable energy.§The AMA has received several letters of complaint from its members, including threats to quit the organisation, and accusations that Gannon has gone back on his pledge to be less political than his predecessor.One letter accused the AMA of supporting political statements instead of an ※evidence-based approach§ to health.※Yes, doctors know that unemployment is destructive to health, but [that] didn＊t prevent the AMA from making a stand against the tobacco industry, with resultant lack of jobs,§ the letter said.※Unless this issue is addressed urgently, the world is likely to overshoot the 2C guardrail of warming, creating huge health, social and economic disruption. I would hope the AMA looks at the science rather than the politics, and actually leads rather than follows the politicians from both our major political parties.§A response by the AMA＊s director of public health, Simon Tatz, sought to reassure that the AMA ※believes that climate change poses a significant worldwide threat to health, and urgent action is required to reduce this potential harm§.※While I can understand your concern at the comments that were recently made, I urge you to consider the AMA＊s stated policy positions on climate change and human health,§ Tatz said. On Sunday Parnis said Gannon＊s comments were a ※wilful distortion of AMA policy§ and could be interpreted as ※trying to put a handbrake on the health benefits of what was a commercial decision to close the Hazelwood power station§.※I have some hesitation in saying that, but I think it was a distortion, a misrepresentation of the AMA policy, of which I remain very proud,§ he said.Parnis also suggested Gannon had not acknowledged the health effects of the power station on the people of the La Trobe valley over decades, which Gannon has disputed.Parnis had not spoken publicly about the AMA since he left his role as vice president in May, but told Guardian Australia he though the issue was too important to stay quiet.Parnis oversaw the renewal and review of the clean air policy in 2015 and told Guardian Australia he ※took exception§ to Gannon＊s comments, as did a number of other members.※It＊s hard to be clear about the level of antipathy towards what was said,§ he said. ※There is a spectrum of opinion in a broad church like the AMA, but I certainly didn＊t hear anyone happy with them.§Gannon said he was aware of the complaints, but said neither he nor the AMA equated the loss of jobs at Hazelwood with the environmental and health benefits that would come from its closure.※The AMA is one of the leading advocates on the issue of climate health,§ he said. ※It＊s just that the AMA has a global view on all of these issues, and I think we can walk and chew gum at same time.§Gannon said he was pointing out there were health impacts from unemployment and carbon abatement, but was at no stage suggesting it was of equal priority to the health benefits of closing a power station which relied on ※the dirtiest form of coal§. ※We need to be cleverer and smarter about carbon abatement and the necessary changes in society to reduce the impacts of climate change,§ he said.※The necessary changes in changing our energy mix and reducing pollution will have victims and we just need to think about that.§Asked to elaborate on his earlier comments suggesting the right balance had not yet been struck before closing Hazelwood, Gannon said a safe base-load power had to be ensured as Australia moved towards a greater renewable proportion in the energy mix, and cited the South Australian blackout.※We just need a secure energy supply, and that does not for one minute diminish very clear AMA policy which is there,§ he said. ※Every member that telephoned or emailed the AMA was responded to and they were pointed in the direction of our policy which talks about all of this 每 the need to reduce the carbon footprint of our society.§Gannon said he wasn＊t being political as the power plant was being shut down by a French multinational corporation, and said while climate change was ※highly political§ he had not been taking a political line."																																																			
"he first sign of autumn appeared the moment we arrived. A , resplendent in its dusky breeding plumage, stopping off on my Somerset coastal patch as it headed south from its Arctic nesting grounds. But the start of July is far too early for any songbird migrants. So along with my companion Daniel, whom I met on our very first day at grammar school, almost half a century ago, I simply enjoyed the fine weather, and its associated  and  butterflies. As we reached the River Parrett, a  flew up into a bramble bush. I like linnets, especially when the males show off their splendid pink breeding plumage, so I lifted my binoculars to take a closer look. And then I saw it. A larger bird, with a russet back and grey head, facing away from me on the same bush. As it turned to reveal a black bandit mask, I heard myself yelling ※!§ Amazingly, it was 每 a splendid male, perched sentinel-like in the July sunshine. Moments later, it flew down and disappeared. Fortunately we relocated it further along the path, and watched in delight as it sallied forth to grab large, juicy flies from a convenient cowpat, before returning to perch amongst the pink and white bramble blooms.  If you awarded a prize for the most striking British songbird, a male red-backed shrike would surely be a clear contender. With its dove-grey head, black mask, white throat, russet back and delicate, peachy breast, it is undoubtedly beautiful. But like all shrikes, it is also astonishingly charismatic and graceful. They may be small 每 somewhere between the size of a sparrow and a starling 每 but with that hooked beak they look rather like a miniature raptor. Indeed, given their carnivorous diet I have always wondered why we don＊t categorise shrikes as birds of prey. Once 每 just about within living memory 每 the red-backed shrike was widely found in southern Britain, where people called it the ※butcher bird§, from its grisly habit of impaling its victims onto thorn bushes. But during the twentieth century the species began to decline, until by the time I began birding in the 1970s it had virtually disappeared. I remember seeing what was then the last British breeding pair, in a car park in the Suffolk Brecks, almost thirty years ago. Since then, in a Lazarus-like resurrection, a few pairs have bred on Dartmoor and in the north of Scotland, though their status remains precarious. Every autumn, red-backed shrikes regularly turn up along the east coast, mostly youngsters on their first migratory journey heading south from Scandinavia to winter in Africa. But what was this splendid male doing in Somerset at the start of July? Was he a failed breeder from further north, or might he even have nested nearby 每 maybe somewhere on Dartmoor or Exmoor?  Either way, discovering the shrike was one of the highlights of my birding life. Yet I would swap all the excitement of the find to see the red-backed shrike return to its former glory as a common and widespread British bird. "																																																			
"It is heartening to see the Guardian giving considered coverage to the issue of human population and its impacts upon our planet and the threat that continued population growth and excessive consumption pose to the wellbeing and indeed survival of future generations (, 12?July). For too long population has been a taboo subject avoided by those normally courageous and outspoken in publicising inconvenient truths about the consequences of ongoing environmental damage.The new study from Lund University showing that the most effective solution to curbing climate change is for people to have fewer children and smaller families confirms research we highlighted back in 2012, when seeking to persuade the likes of Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the World  Fund to talk openly and honestly about population issues (with little success!). That earlier study by Oregon State University concluded that, over a lifetime, a family that chose to have one less child would reduce their?greenhouse gas emissions by 20 times the amount saved from undertaking all other obvious ※eco-friendly§ lifestyle changes.Considering having one less child in developed countries and enabling women in developing countries to have the opportunities and means to choose their family size are ※no-brainers§ that will benefit both people and planet. Using words like ※unsustainable population§ and ※rampant population growth in Africa§, your article (, 10 July) exemplifies a dangerous and persistent species of population alarmism that sees family planning not as a right but as a way to prevent terrorism and stem rising tides of migration. If you＊re concerned about refugees escaping environmental crises, blame the west, not poor women and girls who lack the information, resources, and power to determine whether and when to have children, and how many to have.It would be convenient for the global north not to have to face its life-threatening consumption patterns, but reducing the number of poor people in the global south is not going to solve that problem. Overconsumption of carbon-intensive products, largely by industrialised nations, drives climate change and its effects, not high fertility rates in developing countries.Casting family planning in the global south as a solution to resource stress, migration, terrorism or rising carbon emissions not only unfairly pins blame for these crises on poor women, it also misdiagnoses the problem. Entrenched inequalities, not population numbers, are the problem.So, instead of wringing our hands about ※unsustainable population§, let＊s attack the inequalities that sustain poverty and drive migration, climate change and high fertility. But let＊s do it without shifting responsibility to the poor, and without undermining women＊s rights to reproductive self-determination.Let＊s work together to expand equality and freedom for women and girls no matter where they live, and to rid the planet of the injustices that are the true threat to all of our futures. It has long been apparent to people working in environmental science that overpopulation is one of the two key factors in the destruction of the non-human environment 每 the other being overconsumption by the wealthy world (, 11 July). The impact of the reproductive rate of African women, for example (seven children per female, on average, in many parts), is making itself apparent on the high seas of the Mediterranean, but much more destructively, and less visibly to western eyes, on the wildlife of the African continent. Yet, compared with how much debate goes on about plastic bags and electric cars, constructive discussion about overpopulation is studiously avoided. Climate change is indeed an additional stressor to wild populations already suffering from human-induced habitat loss, but it is humans that will suffer most from it, and in this way it is much the red herring. How ironic that Italy bears the brunt of the surge of ecological migrants, while the pontiff continues to deny that population is a problem, and so inhibits many women of the developing world from accessing birth control. It may be just this issue, however, that forces debate on a humane reduction in human populations, while we still have the resources to do it. Elon Musk and his Teslas are all very flash, but the technological items most required now, globally, environmentally, are condoms and the pill. The National Academy of Sciences study on which you report is an urgent wake-up call about the eradication of wildlife, but I doubt it will be heeded. Sadly our ever increasingly urban populations are so divorced from the countryside and wildlife that the apocalyptic changes taking place go largely unnoticed. The green fields and neatly manicured hedges of our countryside appear to the untrained and fleeting eye to be in pristine condition.When I return to the country lanes around  where I enjoyed an idyllic childhood, it is like wandering through a cemetery. As a boy, I used to find robins＊, yellowhammers＊ and whitethroats＊ nests every few metres; bullfinches, linnets and song thrushes twittered and sang everywhere from the trees and bushes, lapwings and yellow wagtails nested in the fields, and grass snakes sunned themselves on the banks of the myriad small ponds; wildflowers turned the lanes into riotous impressionist paintings. But no longer. These memories will be lost in a generation and few will be aware of what has gone missing. If it were dinosaurs instead of small animals and plants that were disappearing, more notice would be taken perhaps, but this loss is just as drastic and with far-reaching consequences that few of our fellow citizens are aware of.If we don＊t drastically curb our population growth and adopt nature-friendly farming methods as a matter of urgency, we could experience not just a continued steady eradication but a cliff-edge phenomenon. But then it will be too late."

"A lioness has been spotted nursing a tiny leopard cub in , the first time a wild cat is known to have adopted a cub from another species.The five-year old lioness, called Nosikitok is closely monitored by conservationists in the Ngorongoro conservation area and is known to have had a litter of her own in mid to late June.How she came to adopt the leopard cub, thought to be three weeks old, is not known. But Luke Hunter, president of big cat conservation group , said her recent births are a critical factor: ※She is physiologically primed to take care of baby cats, and the little leopard fits the bill 每 it is almost exactly the age of her own cubs and physically very similar to them.※She would not be nursing the cub if she wasn＊t already awash with a ferocious maternal drive. Even so, there has never been another case like it, and why it has occurred now is mystifying. This is a truly unique case. It is quite possible she has lost her own cubs, and found the leopard cub in her bereaved state when she would be particularly vulnerable.§The unique spectacle was captured on camera on Tuesday by a guest at the Ndutu Lodge in Tanzania＊s Ngorongoro conservation area. But the cub faces an uncertain future, even if the lioness continues to nurse it.※It is very unlikely that the lioness＊s pride will accept it,§ Hunter said. ※Lions have very rich, complicated social relationships in which they recognise individuals 每 by sight and by roars 每 and so they are very well equipped to distinguish their cubs from others. If the rest of the pride finds the cub, it is likely it would be killed.§However, if the cub manages to survive for 12-18 months and reaches adulthood, it is likely to revert to leopard behaviour, Hunter said: ※Even its early exposure to lion society would not override the millions of years of evolution that has equipped the leopard to be a supreme solitary hunter. I am sure it would go its own way.§Nosikitok is one of several lions collared and monitored by conservation group , which prevented 26 lion hunts in 2016, including some targeting the Masek pride to which Nosikitok belongs.The hunts take place to prevent, or in retaliation for, attacks on livestock and are the biggest threat facing Ngorongoro＊s lions. KopeLion＊s ※lion scouts§, who come from the Maasai community, work to avoid conflicts by warning local communities when prides are near, reinforcing the corrals that protect livestock and providing wound treatment when animals are attacked."																																																			
"t＊s easy to feel powerless in the face of new coal mines and shrinking rainforests in distant countries, but we also know that being green starts at home. We do what we can, right?

That＊s the second biggest single thing you can do. Next is buying green energy (1.47 tonnes). Even ditching an electric car will save 1.15 tonnes, while replacing a typical car with a (secondhand) hybrid saves 0.52 tonnes, or twice the amount you＊ll save by hanging your clothes to dry (0.21 tonnes; save the same again by washing clothes in cold water).Make it rare 每 as in, ideally, never. Previous studies have detailed the environmental cost of agriculture (15% of all emissions), half of which are caused by livestock. Beef is by far the biggest offender,  and 11 times more water. Eating less meat can have a big impact. Eating none, the new study says, could cut 0.82 tonnes of emissions a year, or eight times the savings triggered by upgrading your lightbulbs (0.1 tonnes). So do that, too.Here＊s the big one, the massive elephant in the travel cot. By far the single biggest thing you can do to help save the planet is to spare it your car-driving, steak-munching, jetsetting progeny. I mean, don＊t feel guilty if you＊re up the duff, but consider this: having one fewer child saves 58.6 tonnes of CO2 a year, or almost seven times the emissions you＊ll save by doing all of the above. And just think how many chickpeas and train tickets you＊ll be able to afford with the financial savings, too."																																																			
"n mainland Britain the common wall lizard () is considered an alien species, and concerns have been raised that competition from this robust and agile continental reptile may be hastening the decline of our rare native sand lizard ().The  is the longest established population of  in Britain and a celebrated part of the island＊s fauna, though its origin is hotly debated. It is believed that in the 1920s there were deliberate releases of the reptile, though local legend has it that they are descendants of survivors from a shipwreck off Bonchurch.

Looking up, I immediately spot a larger, green-tinged, female on a sun-bathed rock. Her bulging body suggests she is gravid, distended with eggs. Spooked by a passing child, her tail whips round and she bolts into a deep fissure at the base of an olive tree trunk. Males are known to be aggressively territorial, so I am unsurprised that after 20 minutes of wall watching all 11 of my sightings have been females. Finally, I catch a glimpse of jewel-bright scales beneath a prostrate rosemary. Crouching down, I find myself face to face with a magnificent male, more than 20 cm in length. He is mottled onyx and emerald, with turquoise spots on his throat and lower flank. Unlike the skittish females, he holds his ground, tilting his angular head and subjecting me to a steady stare as I raise my camera."																																																			
"Scientists from Sweden say ravens are able to think about the future, showing a general planning ability previously documented only in people and great apes. Researchers Can Kabadayi and Mathias Osvath, of Lund University, tested five captive ravens in two tasks they do not do in the wild: using tools and bartering with humans. The results were  by the journal Science. Ravens, along with crows, jays and others, belong to a bird group called corvids. Some corvids have shown that in hoarding food, they do some planning for the future instead of just acting on natural urges. The Lund University ravens showed they could also plan by setting aside a tool that they suspected would get them a tasty treat later. They also prepared for future bartering. This more general planning ability results from the combination of several skills and if it appears in both corvids and great apes, the Swedish researchers said, it must have evolved more than once. The birds were shown a box that had a tube sticking out of the top, plus three stones. They learned that they could use a stone as a tool. If they dropped it down the tube, the box would release a doggie treat. They also learned that other familiar objects, such as a small wooden wheel or a ball, would not work. In one experiment, the ravens were shown the box without any stones available. Then the box was taken away. An hour later, in another location, they were presented with a tray containing a stone plus three objects the birds knew would be useless. They were allowed to choose one thing from the tray. Fifteen minutes later, the box would show up again. In 14 cases of encountering the tray and later seeing the box reappear, the birds usually chose the stone and proceeded to use it correctly. The same thing happened in another experiment, when the box did not show up again until the next day, a delay of 17 hours. Further work showed the ravens would pass up an immediate reward if they could get a better one by waiting. The ravens also showed they could barter for what they needed, learning that they could exchange a blue plastic bottle cap for the favored doggie treat. When the experiments were repeated with the bottle cap replacing the stone, and an experimenter instead of the box, the results were basically the same.  The work presents ※compelling evidence§ of planning ability that goes beyond stashing food away, Markus Boeckle and Nicola Clayton of Cambridge University wrote in a commentary accompanying the study. Although the evidence is new, ravens have long been associated with powers of foresight. In Greek mythology, they are associated with the god of prophecy; an old term for a group of ravens is ※conspiracy§; and in the TV hit Game of Thrones a three-eyed raven appears in a prince＊s prophetic visions. Edgar Allan Poe＊s haunting 1845 narrative poem The Raven, a cornerstone of American literature, features a raven as an uncanny harbinger of doom, constantly repeating the word ※nevermore§."																																																			
"A giant iceberg twice the size of Luxembourg has broken off an ice shelf on the Antarctic peninsula and is now adrift in the Weddell Sea.Reported to be ※§ last month, the trillion-tonne iceberg was found to have split off from the Larsen C segment of the Larsen ice shelf on Wednesday morning after scientists examined the latest satellite data from the area.The Larsen C ice shelf is more than 12% smaller in area than before the iceberg broke off 每 or ※calved§ 每 an event that researchers say has changed the landscape of the Antarctic peninsula and left the Larsen C ice shelf at its lowest extent ever recorded. ※It is a really major event in terms of the size of the ice tablet that we＊ve got now drifting away,§ said Anna Hogg, an expert in satellite observations of glaciers from the University of Leeds. At 5,800 sq km the new iceberg, expected to be dubbed A68, is half as big as the record-holding iceberg B-15 which split off from the Ross ice shelf in the year 2000, but it is nonetheless believed to be among the 10 largest icebergs ever recorded.The huge crack that spawned the new iceberg grew over a period of years, but between 25 May and 31 May alone, the rift grew by 17km 每 the largest increase since January. Between the 24 June and 27 June the movement of the ice sped up, reaching a rate of more than 10 metres per day for the already-severed section. But in the end it wasn＊t a simple break 每 data collected just days before the iceberg calved revealed that the rift had branched multiple times. ※We see one large [iceberg] for now. It is likely that this will break into smaller pieces as time goes by,§ said Adrian Luckman, professor of glaciology at Swansea University and leader of the which is focused on the state of the ice shelf.Unlike thin layers of sea ice, ice shelves are floating masses of ice, hundreds of metres thick, which are attached to huge, grounded ice sheets. These ice shelves act like buttresses, holding back and slowing down the movement into the sea of the glaciers that feed them. ※There is enough ice in  that if it all melted, or even just flowed into the ocean, sea levels [would] rise by 60 metres,§ said Martin Siegert, professor of geosciences at Imperial College London and co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change & Environment. But while the birth of the huge iceberg might look dramatic, experts say it will not itself result in sea level rises. ※It＊s like your ice cube in your gin and tonic 每 it is already floating and if it melts it doesn＊t change the volume of water in the glass by very much at all,§ said Hogg.Following the collapse of the more northerly Larsen A ice shelf in 1995 and  in 2002, all eyes have turned to Larsen C. But Siegert is quick to point out that the calving of the new iceberg is not a sign that the ice shelf is about to disintegrate, stressing that ice shelves naturally break up as they extend further out into the ocean. ※I am not unduly concerned about it 每 it is not the first mega iceberg ever to have formed,§ he said. Andrew Shepherd, professor of Earth Observation at the University of Leeds, agreed. ※Everyone loves a good iceberg, and this one is a corker,§ he said. ※But despite keeping us waiting for so long, I＊m pretty sure that Antarctica won＊t be shedding a tear when it＊s gone because the continent loses plenty of its ice this way each year, and so it＊s really just business as usual!§Luckman said that while the Larsen C ice shelf might continue to shed icebergs, it might regrow. Nevertheless previous research by the team has suggested that the remaining ice shelf is likely less stable now that the iceberg has calved, although it is unlikely the event would have any short-term effects. ※We will have to wait years or decades to know what will happen to the remainder of Larsen C,§ he said, pointing out that it took seven years after the release of a large iceberg from Larsen B before the ice shelf became unstable and disintegrated. What＊s more, Luckman stressed that while large melt ponds were seen on Larsen B prior to its collapse - features which are thought to have affected the structure of the ice shelf - those seen on Larsen C are far smaller and are not even present at this time of year.And while climate change is accepted to have played a role in the wholesale disintegration of the Larsen A and Larsen B ice shelves, Luckman emphasised that there is no evidence that the calving of the giant iceberg is linked to such processes. Twila Moon, a glacier expert at the US National Ice and Snow Data Center agrees but, she said, climate change could have made the situation more likely. ※Certainly the changes that we see on ice shelves, such as thinning because of warmer ocean waters, are the sort [of changes] that are going to make it easier for these events to happen,§ she said.Luckman is not convinced. ※It is a possibility, but recent data from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography actually show most of the shelf thickening,§ he said.The progress of the rift, and the loss of the iceberg, has been carefully followed by analysis of radar images from the European Space Agency＊s  which provides data from the region every six days. ※Before we would have been lucky if we had got one satellite image a year of an event like this, so we would not have been able to watch it unfold,§ said Hogg, pointing out that the radar system allows data to be collected whatever the weather and in the dark, while technological advances mean more data that can be downloaded than for previous satellites.The news of the giant iceberg comes after US president Donald Trump announced that the 每 an agreement signed by more than 190 countries to tackle global warming. ※Truly I am dismayed,§ said Moon of the move.Now at the mercy of the ocean currents, the newly calved iceberg could last for decades, depending on whether it enters warmer waters or bumps into other icebergs or ice shelves."																																																			
"Two months ago you published an article by George Monbiot (, 10 May). I responded in a  (12 May). I wrote that George had not set his sights well, had failed to say which Lake District farmers have fought ※tooth and nail§ against conservation and ※revile§ the National Trust and the RSPB, and had failed to show why world heritage status conferred by Unesco should be disastrous for Lakeland.In this week＊s intemperate article (, 12 July), George has the sheep in his sights again, reviling them as ※a fully automated system for ecological destruction§, and alleging that they ※cleanse the land of almost all wildlife§. This is a travesty of the Lake District I know and love. Unesco＊s award is conditional on conserving the area, and that includes its sheep, as well as its wildlife and its unique tranquillity.I＊d like the Guardian to reprint Steve Bell＊s cartoon of snowbound deep sheep, which I have treasured since December 1999: ※What are you doing for the Millennium, deep sheep?§ ※I think I＊ll be staying put ＃ Maybe have a few friends round.§Does George really think sheep are wolves?

Findings included: forestry produces three times the economic output of farming before subsidy; forestry＊s spending in the local economy is double that of farming; and forestry supports the same number of jobs as farming.While blanket afforestation is neither popular nor desirable, there is a growing body of research and practice, from the likes of the Woodland Trust, that suggests there is great potential for integrating agriculture and forestry to achieve environmental benefits without compromising productivity, eg correctly planted trees provide shelter for sheep, improve drainage and enhance grass growing conditions."																																																			
"his Sunday marks the return of a US pastime that＊s up there with baseball and apple pie: Discovery Channel＊s Shark Week. When it began in 1988, the event was a beneficiary of the pop-culture sensation started by the release of . The film launched sharks into the national consciousness with a potent mix of blood-thirst and perverse thrills. Since Jaws, sharks have continued to chomp through the popular imagination: from the ridiculous (the sharks in Austin Powers, featuring laser beams on their heads, and the Tara Reid-helmed disaster movie Sharknado) to memeable oddities such as Finding Nemo＊s Bruce.But in the past few years, Shark Week has come under fire for its own bout of ※fake news§ after airing a documentary in 2013 called Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives. Save for a momentary disclaimer that called the events portrayed ※dramatized§, Megalodon more or less led audiences to believe a shark that＊s been extinct for at least 2.6m years in fact still roams the ocean blue, corroborating its findings by willfully misquoting scientists and shark cognoscenti.It＊s this kind of sensationalism 每 or downright conspiracism 每 that has bumped up against the original intentions of Shark Week, which were conservation and science- based. Therein lies the central paradox of Shark Week, which drives massive viewership to Discovery which, in turn, sells uber-lucrative advertisements. The weeklong television event reeled in its best ratings ever in 2015 before a slight dip in viewership last year, when it aired earlier than usual because of the Rio Olympics. But there＊s no denying that the average Shark Week viewer wants depictions of the beasts in all their mythic glory, hence titles such as Wrath of a Great White Serial Killer, The Return of the Monster Mako and Shallow Water Invasion, all accompanied by the requisite spooky music. It＊s linked to a primal fear about the predator that since Jaws, and perhaps well before, has followed it around. One critic said: ※§ 每 a 4,000lb Tony Soprano who is perfect for prime-time TV.Shark Week has indeed engaged in quite a bit of fear-mongering, while also grossly overstating the threat sharks pose to humans: you＊re more likely to be killed by vending machines. Sharks, on the other hand, are fatally threatened by us; a  in Marine Policy found that humans kill about 11,000 sharks an hour, or between 100 and 273m a year. In 2015, Discovery brought on president Rich Ross, who pledged an end to documentaries of the Megalodon sort. And in the two installments since, Shark Week has been marginally more restrained in its sensationalist flourishes while also driving some tangible changes, such as congressional  introduced last year banning shark finning.This year, Discovery＊s banking on that imagined tug-of-war between man and shark yet again with a ※battle for ocean supremacy§. The most successful Olympian of all time, , will kick off Shark Week on Sunday night with a race against a Great White. In concept, the spectacle is compelling: Phelps, a ridiculous physical specimen with a body practically tailor-made for competitive swimming, versus the Great White, a fixture in our imaginations, the menacing byproduct of 450 years of evolutionary enhancement. But the Olympian doesn＊t really stand a chance.While Phelps squares off with the Great White, his former team-mate and fellow gold medalist  will be taking part in National Geographic＊s bald-faced Shark Week competitor, SharkFest. Lochte won＊t be racing a shark, but the event＊s being branded as some sort of competition, with the name ※Jeah! vs. Jaws§.Kicking off Shark Week is a 100-meter race between 28-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and a great white shark. While Discovery hasn＊t offered too much information as to how this race will actually work, it＊s safe to say they didn＊t put a great white in a lap pool.Following Phelps is a special hosted by Dr Mark Meekan and conservationist Paul de Gelder, who traveled to the remote Coburg peninsula in the Northern Territory of Australia, where sharks and crocodiles supposedly go head-to-head over sea turtles in this special produced by Big Wave.In Shark Vortex, Greg Skomal and Joe Romeiro chart the migratory patterns of three species of shark 每 great whites, makos and porbeagles 每 that travel north each summer to the beaches of southern New England.In this pun-tastic special narrated by Mr Big himself (Chris Noth),  and the City: New York will examine the reappearance of seals in New York＊s harbors, and whether that means great whites will emerge too.Craig O＊Connell takes a deep dive into the waters of Madagascar, where both great whites and tiger sharks have long been absent; but one, tagged on the coasts of South Africa, traveled 1,500 miles to the island, which could be the next haven for great whites."																																																			
"The storm faded away to a distant rumble of thunder over the hills, taking with it the sticky heat of the past few days and leaving us shivering, in wet clothes, under a sheltering oak.As we emerged, so did the insects. I watched a shield bug ease itself around the edge of a leaf back into the light, picking a path between wobbling water droplets.  abseiled between grass stems, repairing webs. Within a few minutes bumblebees were at work again, shaking rain from water-laden bramble flowers.The moments after a thunderstorm seem to heighten the sense of smell, perhaps because still, moisture-laden, air becomes saturated with dissolved floral scents. Along a hedgerow, the musky, high-summer, odour of elder blossom and the sweet fragrance of wild roses were especially intense. A tropical, fruity, aroma rose from the carpet of pineapple weed,  crushed under our feet along the footpath around the edge of a wheat field.By the time we reached the lane leading to the , our clothes had begun to dry and we slackened our pace.The sun had broken through. A meadow brown butterfly, wings pressed flat on the road, basked in the heat, reluctant to fly until we were a footstep away. Wisps of steam drifted upwards from the drying asphalt, and convection currents of rising air sucked in a breeze that shook water from hogweed umbels, where hoverflies were already settling to feed. For some the rain had come as a blessed relief. At the humpback bridge over the Greta we found scores of snails gliding along the walls, leaving glistening trails. After days of drought spent hiding behind a curtain of ivy, the sudden downpour had coaxed garden ,  out to graze on the algae coating the wet rocks. White-lipped snails,  crawled over nettles, protected by their slime from stings as they climbed the stems, intent on reaching the flowers and tender young leaves.Our walk had begun with the crackle of electricity and a heart-thumping thunderclap overhead. Now the countryside was settling back into the snail＊s pace of a drowsy summer afternoon."																																																			
																																																			
"A nine-year-old girl has filed a lawsuit against the Indian government for failing to take action on climate change, warning that young people will pay the price for the country＊s inaction. In the petition filed with the National Green Tribunal, a special court for environment-related cases, Ridhima Pandey said the government had failed to implement its environment laws. ※As a young person [Ridhima] is part of a class that amongst all Indians is most vulnerable to changes in climate, yet are not part of the decision making process,§ the 52-page petition reads. It calls on the tribunal to direct the government ※to take effective, science-based action to reduce and minimise the adverse impacts of climate change§., Ridhima said: ※My government has failed to take steps to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing extreme climate conditions. This will impact both me and future generations. ※My country has huge potential to reduce the use of fossil fuels, and because of the government＊s inaction I approached the National Green Tribunal.§India＊s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Central  Control Board have been asked to respond within two weeks.

"ew things are as precious as our children＊s health. That＊s why the  on the amount of schools in areas with illegal levels of toxic air is so troubling. The findings expose the severe problems with air pollution in London.But it＊s not just a problem for Londoners. Safe air pollution levels are being breached across Britain. And children are the ones who are most vulnerable. Worryingly, this study drives home the extent to which their lung health is genuinely in danger. Why? This is due, in part, to the immaturity of children＊s respiratory and immune systems. Children＊s lungs are still growing and air pollution can stunt that growth. Evidence has shown that children growing up in polluted areas are four times more likely to have poor lung growth.  with smaller lungs are more likely to have health problems in later life.From links to asthma, chronic chest problems and emerging evidence of the impact on children＊s mental and cognitive health: pollution is bad for children.The UK＊s air quality is more than a hot topic; it＊s a public health crisis. The negative health effects need to be given far greater prominence. that if a baby is exposed to air pollution in the womb, it can alter its lung development. If it is exposed to a lot of air pollution, it can also lead to premature birth and low birth weight.For the rest of us, short-term exposure to dirty air can cause irreparable damage to the lining of our lungs, coughing and wheezing. The irritation to our respiratory system can leave us feeling out of breath. Long-term exposure can lead to a reduction in lung function. There is now a growing body of evidence that there is an increased risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. The statistic that is becoming well known is that it contributes to approximately .So what is causing the high levels of pollution that we are now frequently experiencing? Over the past 30 years, pollution levels have actually improved, but there are still illegal levels in many towns and cities. Since 1970, thanks to changes in power generation and industry, emissions of nitrogen oxides , while emissions of particulate matter (small particles that can get lodged in our lungs) are down nearly 73%. This doesn＊t mean that there isn＊t a serious problem with air pollution.What has changed is an increase in vehicle usage, and  used on the road. This means traffic emissions have become the major source of pollution in urban areas, where the majority of the population lives.The . What this means is that over a lifetime it increases the risk of getting lung cancer in a similar way to inhaling tobacco smoke.Reducing diesel vehicles has to be part of the solution if we＊re going to bring pollution down to safe levels. We need to prioritise getting older, more polluting diesels off the roads. The  believes diesel needs phasing out, but for this to happen much more investment is needed in cleaner and alternative transport options.What＊s frustrating is that the majority of diesel owners bought their cars thinking they were healthier and cleaner. Plus, the tax system continues to provide  to buy diesel cars. We hope the chancellor will address this, and introduce a scrappage scheme to encourage people to switch from diesel to cleaner fuel.I＊ve planted plenty of worries for parents and teachers 每 indeed, for all of us 每 but there are practical steps everyone can take to protect their lungs. In the most polluted places, or when we＊re experiencing a severe reduction in air quality, avoid walking along main roads, steer clear of rush-hour traffic and always carry any medication with you. On the school run, look for alternative routes that avoid busy traffic areas. Cycling and walking, where it＊s practical to do so, is the best option for healthy lungs.A major issue is the lack of available . We need more monitors in places such as schools, providing accurate information to help parents and teachers make practical choices around their health.We hope the chancellor will take bold action next week, creating incentives to reduce diesel vehicles on our roads. It will be a step in the right direction, but it won＊t be enough on its own. We still need a new , with fair and ambitious targets to reduce pollution levels.

"The Global Seed Vault, built in the  as an impregnable deep freeze for the world＊s most precious food seeds, is to undergo a multi-million dollar upgrade after water from melting permafrost flooded its access tunnel.No seeds were  undermined the original belief that the vault would be a ※§ facility, securing the world＊s food supply forever. Now the Norwegian government, which owns the vault, has committed $4.4m (NOK37m) to improvements.The  is buried 130m inside a mountain in the Svalbard archipelago and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. The vault was opened in 2008, sunk deep into the permafrost, and was expected to provide protection against ※the challenge of natural or man-made disasters§ and ※to stand the test of time§.But the vault＊s planners had not anticipated the  seen recently at the end of the . ※The background to the technical improvements is that the permafrost has not established itself as planned,§ said a government statement. ※A group will investigate potential solutions to counter the increased water volumes resulting from a wetter and warmer climate on Svalbard.§One option could be to replace the access tunnel, which slopes down towards the vault＊s main door, carrying water towards the seeds. A new upward sloping tunnel would take water away from the vault. A former Svalbard coal miner, Arne Kristoffersen, told the Guardian most coal mines on the islands had upward sloping entrance tunnels: ※For me it is obvious to build an entrance tunnel upwards, so the water can run out. I am really surprised they made such a stupid construction.§Hege Njaa Aschim, the Norwegian government＊s spokeswoman for the vault, said: ※The construction was planned like that because it was practical as a way to go inside and it should not be a problem because of the permafrost keeping it safe. But we see now, when the permafrost is not established, maybe we should do something else with the tunnel, so that is why we have this project now.§An , with the group＊s conclusions delivered in spring 2018. ※They are going in with an open mind to find a good solution,§ said Aschim. ※$4.4m is for all the improvements we are doing now.§ The  to build.A transformer station, which gives off heat, has already been moved out of the tunnel, and drainage ditches are to be dug into the mountainside above the seed vault, to channel melt water away from the tunnel. A waterproof wall is also to be constructed inside the access tunnel to provide extra protection for the seed vault itself.※The measures form part of a long-term plan to provide additional security to the seed vault, based on a precautionary approach,§ said the government statement.The vault was supposed to be able to survive without the need for human intervention, but is currently being watched 24 hours a day, with pumps readied to remove any water. Aschim said the seeds would remain safe at the -18C temperature in the deep vault: ※But to be sure, and to take precautions in case something happens, we are doing these other measures now to protect the seeds from anything.§Kristoffersen began work in 1980 in coalmine Number 3, which later became the site of a pilot seed storage project that preceded the construction of the Global Seed Vault. He said he took part in an initial planning meeting for the seed vault but was not involved in the subsequent development of the plans.※The whole reason for the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard in the permafrost area is it has to be self sufficient, in case of a really big disaster in the world,§ he said. ※[If] all the humans in the lower part of the world are destroyed, perhaps a 100 years later the survivors can come here and find the seeds. The seeds will be OK as they are in the [deep] permafrost layer. But as it is today, the whole entrance will be filled up with water and this will freeze and it will be blocked after a few years, so it will not be possible to get into the seed vault. There will be a big iceberg in the tunnel.§※The solution is easy and I give it for free,§ Kristofferson said. ※Make a new access tunnel going upward so the water can run out, not into the seed bank. It is not very hard, but it will cost a lot of money.§"																																																			
"The clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, was designed so future governments could ratchet up the ambition of the emissions cuts, Finkel has said on the ABC＊s Q&A program.Labor＊s climate and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, indicated that Labor would do exactly that, if the mechanism was instituted and they then won government.In a landmark report to the Council of Commonwealth Governments last week, Finkel recommended the government adopt a clean energy target, which would make energy users subsidise cleaner forms of electricity generation.But, in the report, Finkel modelled that mechanism with a target of just 28% reductions in emissions from the electricity sector by 2030, which he said was ※as per Australia＊s international obligations under the Paris agreement§, and said deeper cuts would require another review.That advice came under fire, since to achieve a 28% cut in emissions across the entire economy, as Australia committed to in Paris, it is widely agreed much deeper cuts are needed in the electricity sector.The chief executive of the Climate Council, Amanda McKenzie, levelled this criticism at the report.※It doesn＊t go far enough,§ she said. ※It doesn＊t get emissions down as far as they need to go.§She also said it needed to drive coal-fired power stations to be retired sooner and needed to ensure renewable energy made up more than 50% of the mix by 2030. But a member of the audience commented: ※The important thing is bipartisan support first and if Mark [Butler] is fortunate enough to win government he can ratchet it up.§Butler said: ※That＊s the plan.§ Asked by host Tony Jones to explain further, Butler said: ※To get Josh [Frydenberg] to do all the hard work. Then lose and hand it over.§In a more serious tone, Butler indicated he did not think the 28% cut was deep enough, saying ※it is an open question§ and that Labor would seek advice on the appropriate level of cuts.The government＊s Climate Change Authority  that question and suggested cuts twice as deep could be appropriate. Finkel confirmed that he designed the scheme so that it could be scaled up by future governments but warned that plans to immediately change the ambition of the scheme could harm investor confidence. Pressed by Jones, Finkel said his clean energy target was not a price on carbon, despite retailers having to pay generators to emit less carbon, insisting it was an ※incentive§. ※You＊re putting an incentive on low emissions and you can interpret it however you wish,§ Finkel said.Butler had a different view. ※Of course it＊s a price on carbon. It＊s not a direct price but there＊s clearly a shadow price,§ he said.※What this does is to give a price advantage to low-emissions technology. It seeks to shift the relative costs of different types of electricity generation based on their carbon emissions.§ Following former prime minister Tony Abbott＊s interjection into the debate this week, saying the proposed CET could be a ※tax on coal§, the energy minister, , was forced to distance himself from the comments.※It＊s not a tax on coal,§ Frydenberg said. He said his Coalition colleagues were keen that whatever policy they adopt ※allow coal to continue§, he said. ※And I think the clean energy target does that.§ In an , Finkel said the modelling of his plan suggested no new coal power plants would be built and that he would be surprised if any government endorsed a plan that incentivised them."																																																			
" groups have raised concerns over Finland＊s wild wolf population after a new census found numbers far below those regarded as naturally sustainable. show there are currently only about 150 to 180 wolves living in Finland, where the government awards licences to hunt the animals.The estimate is much lower than previous estimates, which put the population at more than 230 animals more than a year ago.It also falls a long way short of the estimated 800 individuals needed to sustain a healthy degree of genetic diversity within the population, according to the , a conservation committee within the Finnish Nature League.This week, the campaigners will meet EU officials to discuss the census data, and the application of Europe＊s Habitat Directive to the remaining wolves in . Under the EU rules, wolves 每 which are classed as endangered 每 should be accorded special status with measures taken to ensure their viability, but conservationists say these rules have not been followed.The Finnish Nature League said the culling of wolves in the last few years had worsened the animals＊ prospects by killing pack leaders, family groups and dispersing packs.The government view has been that culling was needed to minimise the encroachment of wolves on farmers and isolated communities, for their own protection as well as that of people.A hunt targeting 50 grey wolves was , when the number of wild wolves was estimated at approximately 250 animals. It was justified in part as a way of cutting down on the illegal poaching of wolves.However, the licensing has proved controversial, with green groups claiming that the hunting has been indiscriminate, and by dispersing packs without their leaders has led to an increasing danger to the human population and livestock. of the predator, and has been backed by the influential hunting lobbies in countries, such as Norway and Finland, with remaining wild wolf populations, as well as by farmers and people living in rural areas that have seen increased wolf activity. But conservation groups have warned that fragile populations may be in danger of collapse within a few years if current practices are allowed to continue.In Norway a , estimated at fewer than 70 animals, was scaled back after protests last year.Wolf numbers across Europe are thought to have risen to about 12,000. They have been increasing their geographic range and even beginning to encroach on urban areas, leading to , including culls. Finland also shares a border with Russia, home to a large wolf population estimated at more than 50,000, making management of the local population more difficult.Interest in traditional hunting has undergone an unexpected recent revival in the Nordic region.

"Black carbon found in air pollution can increase the resistance of bacteria that cause respiratory disease, research has found.The discover could lead to a greater understanding of the effects of air pollution on human health, according to the lead scientist of the University of Leicester study.The four-year investigation focused on how pollution in the air, which is thought to be responsible for millions of deaths each year, affects bacteria in the nose, throat and lungs of humans.It found black carbon, produced when diesel, biomass and biofuels are burned, changes the way bacteria grow, possibly affecting their ability to survive and beat human immune systems.The study concluded that the resistance of communities of a major cause of respiratory diseases 每 to penicillin was increased by black carbon. It also caused this pathogen to spread from the nose down the respiratory tract, allowing disease to develop.Dr Julie Morrissey, the lead author of the paper, said: ※This work increases our understanding of how air pollution affects human health. It shows that the bacteria which cause respiratory infections are affected by air pollution, possibly increasing the risk of infection and the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment of these illnesses.※Our research could initiate an entirely new understanding of how air pollution affects human health. It will lead to enhancement of research to understand how air pollution leads to severe respiratory problems and perturbs the environmental cycles essential for life.§The university＊s Prof Paul Monks, a leading expert on air pollution, said: ※The lead investigators have brought together their expertise in genetics, microbiology and air pollution chemistry to provide truly multidisciplinary, ground-breaking insights.※This research has significant potential to initiate a global research effort to understand a hitherto unknown effect of air pollution and provide significant additional impetus to the control of pollution.§"																																																			
"The US has refused to sign up to a G7 pledge that calls the Paris climate accord the ※irreversible§ global tool to address climate change. The G7 environment ministers issued a final reportafter their two-day meeting in Bologna, the first since the US announced it was withdrawing from the .In a footnote to the G7 report, the US said on Monday it would not join with the other six countries in reaffirming their Paris commitments, but said it was taking action on its own to reduce its carbon footprint.The US footnote said: ※The United States will continue to engage with key international partners in a manner that is consistent with our domestic priorities, preserving both a strong economy and a healthy environment.§ As a result, the US said it would not join those sections of the report on climate and multilateral development banks. The head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, , attended the first few hours of the summit on Sunday, but left to attend a cabinet meeting in Washington. Presenting the report, Italy＊s environment minister, Gian Luca Galletti, called the Paris accord ※irreversible, non-negotiable and the only instrument possible to combat climate change§. He said the other G7 countries hoped to continue constructive dialogue with the US but insisted on the Paris parameters. ※Everything else for us is excluded,§ he said. The 2015 Paris agreement aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by 2C since the start of the industrial age. As the world has already warmed about 1.1C since the industrial revolution, the accord aims to ensure the threshold is not breached with each nation curbing heat-trapping emissions. All but a few scientists say the overwhelming majority of warming is manmade, as do dozens of scientific academies and professional societies. Scientists have known since the 19th century that burning coal, oil and gas releases CO2 into the air, which then acts like a blanket to trap heat on Earth. Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the Paris accord earlier this month, framing it as a ※reassertion of America＊s sovereignty§. He has said the US could try to re-enter the deal under more favourable terms, but Italy, France and Germany have said the Paris accord cannot be renegotiated. Greenpeace＊s international executive director, Jennifer Morgan, said: ※Paris is non-negotiable and the leadership shown by the G6 countries, along with the cities, states and businesses in the US in moving the agreement forward swiftly is fundamental. Real leaders can and should deliver on clean energy promises in a way that is equitable and strengthens communities. Now it＊s time for G6 countries to match their words with actions and announce how they will increase their climate ambition going into the G20 meeting.§"																																																			
" has pledged up to $1bn a year to dramatically reduce the amount of plastic and other waste products polluting its waters. The announcement was made by Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesia＊s coordinating minister for maritime affairs at last week＊s 2017 World Oceans Summit in Nusa Dua, Bali.Pandjaitan told delegates at the conference that Indonesia would achieve a 70% reduction in marine waste within eight years. He proposed developing new industries that use biodegradable materials such as cassava and seaweed to produce plastic alternatives. Other measures could include a nationwide tax on plastic bags as well as a sustained public education campaign. The World Bank estimates that each of Indonesia＊s 250 million inhabitants is responsible for between 0.8 and 1kg of plastic waste per annum. Only China dumps more waste in the ocean, according to a  in the journal Science.The world＊s second biggest plastic polluter also boasts the world＊s highest levels of marine biodiversity. Indonesia lies at the heart of the ; its incredibly rich coral reef ecosystems support crucial fisheries, provide food security for millions and are a growing draw for tourists. Plastic pollution is just one of the threats to these ecosystems services, but it＊s a serious one. A recent study suggests that by 2050, there could be more plastic than biomass in the world＊s oceans. Plastics have entered the marine food chain and are already Indonesia＊s commitment is part of the UN＊s new campaign, which aims to tackle consumer plastics through a range of actions 每 from cutting down on single use plastics such as shopping bags and coffee cups to pressuring firms to cut down on plastic packaging. Nine countries have already joined Indonesia in signing up to the campaign, including Uruguay, which will impose a tax on single use plastic bags and Costa Rica, which is promising better waste management and education. But Indonesia＊s target of a 70% reduction by 2025 is ambitious. Across the country＊s 17,000 islands there is poor public understanding of the problems created by plastic waste. Companies produce small scale products such as single use shampoo packets and confectionery that are popular in communities where cash flow pressures and habit prevent more sustainable consumption. Add poor waste management infrastructure and the scale of the challenge comes into sharp focus. During rainy season, thousands of tonnes of rubbish discarded in rivers and waterways washes up on Indonesia＊s shores. Heavy machinery is often brought in to clear the tourist beaches of Bali and local communities and non-profits are constantly organising large scale beach clean ups.Last year, a tax on single use plastic bags was trialed in 23 cities across Indonesia. While the government reported a big reduction in plastic bag use, there was significant resistance both from consumers and industry, according to Siti Nurbaya, Indonesia＊s minister for the environment. This is delaying a bill to impose a nationwide tax of not less than Rp.200 (1p) per plastic bag. Environmentalists will be hoping that the promised funding effectively channels resources and expertise into public awareness and education programmes, improvements in waste management, pressure on industry and initiatives that encourage alternatives to plastic packaging. The UN campaign reminds us all, however, that plastic pollution is a problems we can all address with some very simple changes in behaviour. "																																																			
"ith , the environment continues to make headlines across the globe. Climate change remains high on the agenda, renewable energy discussions roll on, and sustainability is becoming more involved in conversations about food.It＊s never been more important to talk about green issues in the classroom 每 and technology can help. From cutting-edge hardware to the latest smartphone apps, there are valuable tools for creating immersive lessons, and to bring the issues surrounding the environment to life. From a journey into the natural world to learning about the habits of sharks, here＊s some tech to help pique environmental interest in the classroom.Many of us will have spent time exploring nature alongside Sir David Attenborough. Now the  smartphone app allows you to access 1,000 moments from the broadcaster＊s output, offering bite-size portions on which to base a lesson. Clips from this app could provide the perfect inspiration for discussing the state of our oceans, or a climate change lesson could look at the struggle of penguins and polar bears, brought to life by Attenborough＊s legendary narration.If these activities inspire the class to think about vulnerable or endangered species, then Ocearch＊s smartphone-based  could provide context for an intriguing follow-up lesson. The project tracks sharks tagged for conservation reasons. The app allows users to watch their movements around the oceans, promoting a greater understanding of the populations and behaviours of these oft-maligned creatures.With  each year across Europe alone, waste is becoming an important subject to tackle at school. Students could take note of their own household food usage, to encourage them to think about their impact, before using an app such as  alongside class projects on recycling or food sustainability. The app allows people to connect with each other and local businesses, so surplus food can be shared rather than discarded. This type of tool could feed in to an initiative looking, for example, at sharing waste food with good causes locally.London saw  between 17 and 24 January this year, and the UK has broken EU air quality regulations every year since 2010. Against this backdrop, you could try making use of an air monitor app, such as , as the basis for a series of lessons on air quality or pollution. It collates data, creates visualisation of air quality across the globe in real time, and can encourage students to think about their local environment.In future,  monitor might make an interesting classroom accessory, allowing classes to take regular readings and chart the air quality of their city. Currently in development, the device will measure pollution levels, exhaust fumes or household chemicals. Plume Labs was also behind , which tracked a flock of pigeons wearing tiny, pollution-sensing backpacks around London in March 2016 - and could add a fun case study. A more global view of climate change can be woven into lesson plans by using the NASA  app. This uses near real-time data on surface air temperature, carbon dioxide levels and sea-level variation among other factors to create colour-coded maps of environmental conditions.Virtual reality (VR) seems to have been tipped as the next big thing since the 1980s, but 2017 may be the year it arrives. With the likes of Oculus Rift and Playstation VR, headsets are heading towards the mainstream, and could make for absorbing educational tools.While cost remains restrictive to widespread classroom adoption, the lower-cost  could go some way towards making a VR-assisted classroom a reality.The educational possibilities of VR are clear 每 offering a fully immersive landscape for students to participate in. Companies such as  are creating educational programmes for the technology, with Titanic VR and Apollo VR experiences already available.Apps such as , which allows teachers to lead their class on a virtual field trip, can be used as a memorable 360-degree experience to highlight environmental causes or issues. With the help of a VR helmet, a science class can be transformed into an underwater odyssey, or an exploration of the rainforests, giving hands-on experience of areas most impacted by environmental issues."																																																			
"Foxes loitering around rubbish bins and pigeons roosting in train stations: urban animals are widely regarded as the dregs of the natural world.However, according to biologist Simon Watt, cities represent some of the world＊s hotspots for  and behavioural adaptation. Speaking at the Cheltenham science festival, Watt, who is founder of the Ugly Animal Preservation Society, said: ※The ice caps are melting, the rainforest is shrinking, . If we＊re going to look for evolutionary shifts right now in our world, the place to look is cities.§In his talk, Watt cited a host of examples of how the urban environment is prompting new genetic shifts and unexpected behaviours. A proportion of black cap warblers, which used to migrate to Morocco or southern Spain, have shifted their route to Britain where urban heat islands and garden bird feeders allow them to survive at more northerly latitudes than was previously possible.※The ones that come to Britain are starting to get shorter wings 每 better for manoeuvrability, worse for long flights 每 and longer beaks, which are better to get through the wee bars of garden bird feeders, although worse for things like fruits and berries.§In Australia, the mating croak of the male pobblebonk frog has been steadily rising in pitch, an adaptation that means it can still attract females in the presence of the background rumble of motorway traffic.※Pobblebonks never hear their parents, so it＊s an evolutionary shift,§ said Watt. Outside the urban setting the frogs with the deepest croak tend to be most attractive to females. ※They still would be the most attractive males if they could be heard, but it＊s become an advantage to have a falsetto,§ he added. ※Barry White is out, Justin Bieber is in.§ have also changed their vocalisations, although this appears to be acclimatisation rather than evolution. ※In general we can say that birds in cities have a couple of things in common. They tend to sing at a higher pitch, they tend to use fewer notes and they tend to sing faster,§ he said. ※They have their own urban music. This happens across all the species, they sing at different times 每 at night because they＊ve got street lights. They are not quite sure when it＊s bedtime. It does mean that some of these birds are stressed out.§A weed, called  每 which looks like a delicate version of the dandelion, is evolving to release higher numbers of heavy seeds and fewer light floaty ones (the plants produce a mixture) because of its concrete-bound existence. ※If you＊re in concrete, there＊s no point in distributing your seeds widely, you＊re better to just land your seeds in the patch next to you,§ said Watt.There is even a species, sometimes known as the London Underground mosquito, which has adapted from a southern mosquito variety to survive in the warm underground spaces of northern cities.Watt said the types of species that are able to thrive in urban environments tend to be adaptable omnivores, relatively intelligent and scavengers by nature.※In other words they＊re rather a lot like us,§ he said. He added that the changes taking place in the urban environment were sometimes neglected, even by the scientific community. ※We don＊t have to go to Borneo to watch evolution in action.§"																																																			
"onald Trump＊s announcement that the US will withdraw from the Paris agreement was always going to be an exercise in idiocy. But he unwittingly brought it to new heights Thursday, when he chose exactly the wrong city to be the face of his disastrous decision.※I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh,§ he said, ※not Paris.§Cities don＊t speak but the numbers do, and the numbers say that Trump is full of it. More than 75% of Pittsburgh voters backed Hillary Clinton. Having revitalized itself from a coal and steel-based economy, its renewable energy industry is now a major employer, providing  13,000 jobs. The editorial board of its flagship paper, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, has laid out in no uncertain terms how leaving the global agreement would . And the city＊s Mayor Bill Peduto, long an outspoken supporter of the global agreement, was actually in Paris in 2015 when the accord was drafted.Pittsburgh is 〞 if anything 〞 a posterchild for moving in the opposite direction on climate and Peduto has used every platform available to express his outrage over Trump＊s line. Expanding the lens beyond Pittsburgh doesn＊t do Trump any favors either.Trump didn＊t even win Pittsburgh＊s surrounding Allegheny county, which swung by more than 10 points for Clinton. And though he did win the state overall,  and the state＊s governor Tom Wolf has no illusions about what Trump＊s move will do for the local economy. ※This decision hurts our economy and Pennsylvania residents,§ he  the Post Gazette.Mostly though, it will hurt people overseas.  was already expected to cause an estimated 250,000 deaths per year in coming decades, even before Trump＊s decision pull out of Paris, according to estimates from the World Health Organization. Among the hardest hit will be the old and the sick and the weak living in the poorest parts of sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia.Nevermind that seven in ten Americans support the Paris agreement, which countries all over the world have worked for decades to realize. And nevermind that the agreement, which seeks to limit warming to below 2 degrees celsius, is legally non-binding meaning Trump could simply ignore it: the standards the US would be held to under it are literally the standards that it sets for itself. None of that mattered to Trump. He wanted to make a spectacle out of this moment. And standing, perversely, amidst the beautiful idyllic greenery of the White House rose garden, he proceeded to make the fate of the world just that: a fundamentally flawed talking point.Instead of observing the overwhelming reality of what scientific evidence tells us about the dangers posed by global warming, Trump＊s decided to cater to the narrow, ideological interests of people like Myron Ebell and Scott Pruitt. As former secretary of state John Kerry put it in an interview with NPR Thursday: ※Really, it＊s one of the most disastrous, shallow, untruthful decisions a president of the United States has made in my lifetime.§Earlier this week we saw climate deniers in his cabinet and White House appeared to have prevailed upon the president to the point where he won＊t even confirm that climate change is not a hoax. This is not politics as usual. We＊re approaching flat earth territory. And the Pittsburgh moment matters because it reveals a larger truth about how Trump is approaching his job in the White House and the fate of the world. It＊s not just that he has no mastery of the material over which he＊s presiding so powerfully 〞 research might have fixed that error. He chose the line carelessly, presumably for its alliteration, and with an utter disregard for truth and the dire consequences his distortions will have on real people, including the very ones who elected him.Trump＊s never cared much for integrity, but the dangers of his shallowness have never glowed more bright."																																																			
																																																			
"The United States will meet its Paris accord greenhouse gas targets despite Donald Trump＊s withdrawal from the agreement, former New York mayor  has said.A decision by and seek renegotiated terms ※fair§ to America has drawn widespread international condemnation.But Bloomberg, currently the United Nations special envoy for cities and climate change, said work would continue to reduce emissions despite Trump＊s statement.※The US will meet our Paris commitment and through a partnership among American cities, states, and businesses, we will seek to remain part of the Paris Agreement process,§ he said.※The American government may have pulled out of the agreement, but the American people remain committed to it 每 and we will meet our targets.※Americans don＊t need Washington to meet our Paris commitment and Americans are not going to let Washington stand in the way of fulfilling it.※That＊s the message mayors, governors, and business leaders all across the US have been sending.§The Paris accord commits countries to holding global temperature rises to ※well below§ 2C above pre-industrial levels, which will require global emissions to be cut to net zero by the second half of the century.Scientists have warned that a failure to curb dangerous climate change will lead to sea level rises, more intense storms and flooding, more extreme droughts, water shortages and heatwaves as well as massive loss of wildlife and reduction in crop yields, potentially sparking conflict and mass migration.Despite the decision by the US, the second biggest polluter after China, to pull out of the deal, many analysts suggest the shift to a low-carbon economy is now unstoppable, with renewable prices tumbling and new clean technology being developed and deployed.Trump＊s decision prompted criticism from many US business leaders, including clean-tech entrepreneur and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and Robert Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney company, who said they had resigned from the president＊s advisory council over the issue.Announcing his decision on Thursday, Trump claimed the Paris deal allows countries such as China and India to carry on polluting at the expense of the US economy and jobs.He said the US would stop implementing measures to meet its commitments under the agreement to cut emissions by 26-28% on 2005 levels by 2025, and end funding for poor countries to cope with climate change.In a press conference after a summit between the EU and China, European council president  said the bloc was stepping up co-operation with China on climate change.※Which means that today, China and Europe have demonstrated solidarity with future generations and responsibility for the whole planet,§ Tusk said.He said the US decision to leave the Paris agreement was a ※big mistake§, bigger than its failure to ratify the previous international climate deal, because the new agreement 每 which covers all countries 每 was fairer.※But the fight against climate change, and all the research, innovation and technological progress it will bring, will continue, with or without the US,§ he said."																																																			
"Scientists have discovered ※extraordinary§ levels of toxic pollution in the most remote and inaccessible place on the planet 每 the 10km deep  in the Pacific Ocean.Small crustaceans that live in the pitch-black waters of the trench, captured by a robotic submarine, were contaminated with 50 times more toxic chemicals than crabs that survive in heavily polluted rivers in China.※We still think of the deep ocean as being this remote and pristine realm, safe from human impact, but our research shows that, sadly, this could not be further from the truth,§ said Alan Jamieson of Newcastle University in the UK, who led the research.※The fact that we found such extraordinary levels of these pollutants really brings home the long-term, devastating impact that mankind is having on the planet,§ he said.Jamieson＊s team identified two key types of severely toxic industrial chemicals that were banned in the late 1970s, but do not break down in the environment, known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). These chemicals have previously been found at  in the Canadian Arctic and in .The research, , suggests that the POPs infiltrate the deepest parts of the oceans as dead animals and particles of plastic fall downwards. POPs accumulate in fat and are therefore concentrated in creatures up the food chain. They are also water-repellent and so stick to plastic waste.※The very bottom of the deep trenches like the  are inhabited by incredibly efficient scavenging animals, like the 2cm-long amphipods we sampled, so any little bit of organic material that falls down, these guys turn up in huge numbers and devour it,§ said Jamieson.He said it was not unexpected that some POPs would be found in the deepest parts of the oceans: ※When it gets down into the trenches, there is nowhere else for it to go. The surprise was just how high the levels were 每 the contamination in the animals was sky high.§ The level of one type of POP, called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), was only equalled anywhere in the northwest Pacific in , an infamous pollution blackspot. The researchers also found severe contamination in amphipods collected in the Kermadec trench, which is 7,000km from the Mariana trench. The pollution was ubiquitous, found ※in all samples across all species at all depths in both trenches§, the scientists said.PCBs were manufactured from the 1930s to the 1970s, when their appalling impact on people and wildlife was realised. About a third of the 1.3m tonnes produced has already leaked into coastal sediments and the open oceans, with a steady stream still thought to be coming from poorly protected landfill sites.An expedition conducted by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last year  on the slopes leading to the Sirena Deep, part of the Mariana trench, and the nearby Enigma Seamount. They included a tin of Spam, a can of Budweiser beer and several plastic bags.The results are both significant and disturbing, said the marine ecologist Katherine Dafforn at the University of New South Wales in Australia and not part of the research team: ※The trenches are many miles away from any industrial source and suggests that the delivery of these pollutants occurs over long distances despite regulation since the 1970s.※We still know more about the surface of the moon than that of the ocean floor,§ Dafforn said. She said the new research showed that the deep ocean trenches are not as isolated as people imagine. ※Jamieson＊s team has provided clear evidence that the deep ocean, rather than being remote, is highly connected to surface waters. Their findings are crucial for future monitoring and management of these unique environments.§POPs cause a wide range of damage to life, particularly harming reproductive success. Jamieson is now assessing the impact on the hardy trench creatures, which survive water pressures equivalent to balancing a tonne weight on a fingertip and temperatures of just 1C.He is also examining the deep sea animals for evidence of plastic pollution, , which has been the focus of much recent attention, leading to  in the UK and US. ※I reckon it will be there,§ he said.Jamieson said it had been positive that the dangers of POPs had been identified and their use ended but that plastic pollution presented a new concern for contamination of the oceans. ※We＊ve just done it again,§ he said."

It ※strongly encouraged§ Australia to ※accelerate efforts to ensure meeting the immediate and long-term targets of the plan, which are essential to the overall resilience of the property, in particularly regarding water quality§.It also said climate change remained ※the most significant overall threat§ to the future of the reef, and ※recommended that the committee express its serious concern at the coral bleaching and mortality that occurred in 2016 and at the second event underway in early 2017.※While the long-term effects of these events cannot be fully evaluated yet, their scale serves to underline the severity of the threat to the property from climate change,§ Unesco said. ※At the site level, there is a need to consider how these mass bleaching events influence the effectiveness of the [] in its current form, notably in relation to the most urgently needed measures and improvements that contribute to the property＊s resilience.§Meeting those water quality targets would require a ten-fold increase in investment to $10bn over the next 10 years, the leading expert on water quality for the reef, Jon Brodie, said.It would also involve transitioning farmland in the Great Barrier Reef catchment from sugar cane plantations, which use fertilisers that cause much of the water pollution in the reef, to a less high-intensity form of agriculture, such as grazing.※There＊s things that could be done for the water quality part but it＊s hard to see this government doing them,§ Brodie told Guardian Australia. ※The federal government is unfortunately just writing the Great Barrier Reef off. Other things are more important to them, like the support of farmers in Queensland, and the coal industry.§Brodie said improving water quality would ※not be enough by itself§ to save the reef, which faces its most direct threat from climate change.But unlike climate change, Brodie said, the quality of water flowing into the reef is directly under the control of existing Australian legislation. Improving water quality cannot prevent future bleaching events, but it can improve the capacity of the reef to recover.The environment minister, , welcomed the Unesco draft decision on Saturday, which he said ※confirms the Reef 2050 plan has been effective§. ※The draft decision points to the importance of the reef＊s resilience despite the challenges faced from coral bleaching,§ he said.Frydenberg acknowledged the committee＊s push for accelerated action on water quality and said international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was ※critical for reefs worldwide, including the Great Barrier Reef§. He cited Australia＊s continued commitment to the Paris agreement, which the , as evidence of Australia＊s efforts. is expected to release a second report on the impact of climate change on the health of all world heritage listed reefs before the July meeting.Richard Leck, oceans campaigner for the World  Fund, said that while the impacts of water quality and land clearing on the health of the reef were significant, climate change remained the major threat.If the global climate warmed by 1.5 degrees, Leck said, the Great Barrier Reef would not survive. ※We need to have climate policies that will actually protect the reef and currently our climate policies are nowhere near sufficient to get the action required to save the reef,§ he said.The Australian Marine Conservation Society seconded that concern, and called on the Queensland government to immediately introduce land clearing laws, scrapped under the Newman government, to reduce the amount of runoff flowing into the reef＊s catchment.

"ince mid May the hawthorn next to my kitchen window has been covered with greenfly. The leaves and stems are plastered with clusters of the sap-sucking insects and a dandruff of white cast skins, which the sub-adults moult as they mature.Reproducing asexually by parthenogenesis, these  give birth to live offspring born with the embryos of the next generation inside their bodies. Nymphs reach sexual maturity in as little as five days, and a reproductively active adult can produce up to 12 genetic copies of itself a day.I＊m used to seeing wasps, blue tits, ladybirds and their larvae feasting on this aphid army, but one morning I noticed three common carder bumblebees, a red-tailed bumblebee and a buff-tailed bumblebee scouting the tree. Their presence was curious. Bumblebees don＊t prey on other insects and there was no nectar as the infested flower buds were deformed and had failed to open. I went outside to investigate, and discovered that the bees were landing on the foliage and unrolling their tongues to mop up , the sticky fluid excreted by aphids as they feed. Surprised by this behaviour, I contacted the . They told me that there is limited research on the subject, but that every year they receive reports from members of the public who witness this phenomenon.It is most often observed in areas where there is little in flower, which could indicate that honeydew is a nectar substitute when suitable forage plants are scarce. This is perplexing, as my organically cultivated wildlife garden is blooming with an array of bee-friendly plants. Despite my wildflower meadow and herbaceous borders buzzing, over the past few weeks I have recorded seven  making daily visits to the hawthorn. Scientists have expressed concern that feeding on honeydew could expose bumblebees to plant toxins evolved to counteract sucking pests. Honeydew also lacks protein, which provides essential nourishment for a colony＊s developing brood. However, most of the worker bees have arrived at the tree with their pollen baskets already bulging. They appear to gather protein-rich pollen from the flowers, then seek out honeydew rather than feeding on nectar. But why?"

"Walking barefoot through a field of long grass, I poked into a molehill with my big toe. Its summit was like toasted breadcrumbs and the dislodged granules rolled down the slopes as loose scree.My rotating foot waggled deeper, finding darker, damp, earth that held firm. The moisture suggested that this molehill was an eruption from the night before; the toes told what the eyes could only surmise.I had shed my footwear only minutes before, upon reaching a ford at a stream. There was aerial traffic here, a never-ending straggle of  engaged in barrel-roll tussles a metre or so above the water. The disputatious damsels were all flying upstream, perhaps catching the same breeze that just now rippled the water＊s surface and broke the sun＊s reflection into hundreds of stars. The stream ran pleasingly clear over a bed of gravel, and it was alive with shoals of minnows darting this way and that. One shoal flocked to the shallowest of shallows at the water＊s edge, the fish taking turns to purse their lips and kiss the shoreline pebbles. All at once, they packed into a tight bunch at the very edge and I saw the cause 每 a small perch four times their size, with tiger stripes on its back. It was no danger though, for it shot across into deeper water downstream where even bigger fish with black-tipped tails toyed with the current. I felt the heat of the day, imagined the cool of the water and wanted to wade with the fishes. Taking shoes and socks off seemed like a release, a liberation even. It was almost a strip down to primal essentials. A refreshing chill lapped at my bare ankles, gravel squirmed underfoot, straggles of waterweed were like slippery strands of seaweed. Beneath the dry grass on the other side, I experienced every uneven bobble, each tilt of the ground, Neolithic man reborn with tracker feet. But I was a soft-soled individual and after a few hundred metres I came again to harder, stony, unyielding ground and slipped back into contemporary size 10s.

"adia Faisal, a cleaning woman in Lahore, remembers the sudden onset of . When she returned home, she found her children playing in a narrow alley, their eyes red and watering. ※My kids were asking me ＆What＊s happening?＊.§The hazardous pollutants across Lahore＊s skyline caused residents respiratory difficulties, eye irritation, and cardiac complications, among other ailments. Pakistan＊s second-largest city, home to more than 10 million people, is facing elevated levels of air pollution, thanks to rapid industrialisation, growing vehicular emissions and tree slashing, and increased crop burning and coal plant emissions from neighbouring India.※I have never experienced this before. This was scary,§ says 20-year-old college student Salma Khalid. ※I had breathing problems, so I skipped two classes today. I＊m staying indoors.§Last year, almost 60,000 Pakistanis  from the high level of fine particulate matter in the air, among the highest death tolls in the world from air pollution, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).Pakistan＊s median exposure levels to  每 among the most harmful pollutants in the air 每 is 68 in urban areas, compared to just 12 in UK cities,  (pdf). The WHO sets a standard safe PM 2.5 level at 25 ?g/m3. This month, numbers rose above 100 in Lahore, according to the city＊s environment protection agency (EPA) data.As South Asia＊s most  country, Pakistan contends with increasing challenges from the increase in motor vehicles in cities. In the last decade, more than 11m cars appeared on the roads in Pakistan＊s most populous province, representing a growth of almost 30%, according to a report from the Punjab environmental protection department (EPD). Although the environmental body has recommended the government mandate low-sulphur diesel and increase higher public transport use, these results have been slow to materialise.Stubble burning in neighbouring India has also been cited as a major culprit behind worsening pollution, but not all residents are convinced the blame lies across the border: ※They＊re just blaming it on India, but they＊re not thinking about solutions or precautions they can take in ,§ says Sanum Finyas, a 26-year-old student in Lahore. The polluting practice on agricultural land is common in Pakistan＊s Punjab, resulting in plumes of toxic smoke carrying over to the neighbourhoods of Lahore.And natural urban barriers to air pollution have increasingly disappeared. In the past year alone, Lahore cut down more than 2,200  in the city, removing a natural carbon sink able to absorb some of the large quantities of carbon dioxide and fine particulate matter released into the air. Reducing deaths from air pollution is one of the aims of the sustainable development goals. One of the targets for goal three, , is ※substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil§ by 2030. It is uncertain how Pakistan can achieve this. For one, there are few ambient air monitors in the city. Earlier last month when air toxicity levels reached critical levels the only monitoring machine was more than three hours away in another city, assessing emissions from a cement factory.Solutions to address the root causes of air pollution are slowly appearing. The federal government recently unveiled a large-scale tree plantation programme, promising to plant more than 100m trees in Pakistan during the next several years.The Punjab government has also instituted a number of emergency measures to mitigate the pollution, such as banning the burning of agricultural waste and closing steel mill factories. ※We sealed steel mills who have not installed air pollution control devices,§ says Punjab EPA director Waseem Cheema.The most effective solution may be to cut the number of cars on the road. ※The government is creating awareness to reduce traffic load,§ says Sohail Anwar from the . ※People should know how much we are contributing in creating environmental pollution.§The lack of public transport in Lahore is a barrier to reducing the number of cars on the road. The Orange Line Metro project is under construction and has ambitions to dramatically increase public transport in the city by serving a quarter million passengers per day, alleviating some of the traffic congestion on the road.※We must control vehicular pollution,§ Cheema stresses. ※This includes from two-stroke [auto] rickshaws and from old vehicles that need proper tuning and inspection.§ To this end, the EPA has imposed more frequent road checks by teams of a traffic policeman, an official from a regional transport authority and an environmental inspector. Vehicles failing basic maintenance requirements are fined or impounded, and in the most extreme cases, the police may register a case against the owner in the court of the environmental magistrate.Without interventions, experts predict that Pakistan＊s air pollution may worsen in the coming years. Increased motorisation, poor public health warning systems, and unchecked industrial pollution are exposing larger swathes of the population to health risks.※People don＊t understand the implications, or that children are the most severely affected,§ says Dr Ijaz Ahmad Butt, a public health physician from Lahore＊s Mayo Hospital. ※The public needs to be informed through the media.§The government relied on the PTV public broadcaster to disseminate warnings about hazardous smog, instructing residents to minimise exposure to outdoor air, wear face masks, and keep children inside. Not all citizens are waiting for the government to take action. , saying the EPD had failed to crack down on the commercial industries most responsible for releasing pollutants: ※The EPD is not taking action against commercial enterprises because they have become influential. What regulations exist are not properly enforced,§ says Zaka. ※The industrialists are polluting the environment and the public is paying the cost.§Meanwhile, at Lahore traffic stops where groups of men sit out in the open, the lack of public messaging about the risks from prolonged air pollution exposure is apparent. ※For the neediest, the government should provide environmental shelter and face masks,§ says 22-year-old Lahore resident Noshien Shaukat. ※The most vulnerable members of society have no information and remain at risk.§"																																																			
																																																			
"※Thank you very much. [Applause.] Thank you. I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist . We＊re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. But it is really very sad as to what＊s going on throughout the world with terror. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.※Before we discuss the Paris accord, I＊d like to begin with an update on our tremendous 每 absolutely tremendous 每 economic progress since election day on November 8th. The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly. We＊ve added $3.3tn in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.※I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It was a very, very successful trip, believe me. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.※In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations. We＊re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.※Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up 每 and you see that, you see it all over 每 from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren＊t doing so much in the form of contribution.※One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for president 每 whether it＊s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous supreme court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. And believe me, we＊ve just begun. The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.※On these issues and so many more, we＊re following through on our commitments. And I don＊t want anything to get in our way. I am fighting every day for the great people of this country.※Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord 每 [applause] thank you, thank you 每 but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. So we＊re getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that＊s fair. And if we can, that＊s great. And if we can＊t, that＊s fine. [Applause.]※As president, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens. The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers 每 who I love 每 and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.※Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.※Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7m lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates. This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs 每 not what we need 每 believe me, this is not what we need 每 including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.※According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper down 12%; cement down 23%; iron and steel down 38%; coal 每 and I happen to love the coal miners 每 down 86%; natural gas down 31%. The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3tn in lost GDP and 6.5m industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.※Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States 每 which is what it does 每 the world＊s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world＊s leading polluters.※For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years 每 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.※Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America 每 which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. We＊re having a big opening in two weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand new mine. It＊s unheard of. For many, many years, that hasn＊t happened. They asked me if I＊d go. I＊m going to try.※China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can＊t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. We＊re supposed to get rid of ours. Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.※In short, the agreement doesn＊t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.※This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States. The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris agreement 每 they went wild; they were so happy 每 for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.※We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America＊s poorest workers out of poverty. Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation 每 it＊s great wealth, it＊s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth 每 and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.※The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. At 1% growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4% growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country 每 [applause] 每 will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.※Even if the Paris agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree 每 think of that; this much 每 Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America 每 and this is an incredible statistic 每 would totally wipe out the gains from America＊s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.※As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning: ＆The reality is that withdrawing is in America＊s economic interest and won＊t matter much to the climate.＊ The United States, under the , will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We＊ll be the cleanest. We＊re going to have the cleanest air. We＊re going to have the cleanest water. We will be environmentally friendly, but we＊re not going to put our businesses out of work and we＊re not going to lose our jobs. We＊re going to grow; we＊re going to grow rapidly. [Applause.]※And I think you just read 每 it just came out minutes ago, the small business report 每 small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people. One of the best reports they＊ve seen in many years.※I＊m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers. [Applause.]※So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let＊s make them non-obstructionists. We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal. And we＊ll make it good, and we won＊t be closing up our factories, and we won＊t be losing our jobs. And we＊ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris accord or something that we can do that＊s much better than the Paris accord. And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that, we＊re out of the agreement.※I will work to ensure that America remains the world＊s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.※No responsible leader can put the workers 每 and the people 每 of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world＊s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement: It＊s to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That＊s not going to happen while I＊m president. I＊m sorry. [Applause.]※My job as president is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection.※Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it＊s doing very well. I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. The Republicans are working very, very hard. We＊d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone. But it＊s going very well.※The Paris agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country＊s expense. They don＊t put America first. I do, and I always will. [Applause.]※The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You see what＊s happening. It＊s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.※At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don＊t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more. And they won＊t be. They won＊t be.※I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. [Applause.] I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America＊s interests. Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation. Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they＊ll soon be under renegotiation. The process has begun from day one. But now we＊re down to business.※Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund 每 nice name 每 which calls for developed countries to send $100bn to developing countries all on top of America＊s existing and massive foreign aid payments. So we＊re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we＊re already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven＊t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.※The green fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1bn 每nobody else is even close; most of them haven＊t even paid anything 每 including funds raided out of America＊s budget for the war against terrorism. That＊s where they came. Believe me, they didn＊t come from me. They came just before I came into office. Not good. And not good the way they took the money.※In 2015, the United Nation＊s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100bn per year as ＆peanuts＊, and stated that ＆the $100bn is the tail that wags the dog＊. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund＊s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450bn per year after 2020. And nobody even knows where the money is going to. Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?※Of course, the world＊s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the green fund, which we terminated. America is $20tn in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that.※There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the US economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America＊s sovereignty. [Applause.] Our constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And I will.※Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America＊s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.※The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point 每 as bad as it is 每 not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States＊ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.※As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people. The Paris accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit the Paris accord 每[applause] 每 and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.※It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 每 along with many, many other locations within our great country 每 before Paris, France. It is time to make America great again. [Applause.] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.※Thank you very much. Very important. I＊d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.§"																																																			
"Campaigners, health charities and neighbourhood groups have welcomed plans by the London mayor, , to more than double funding to clean up the capital＊s dirty air.London is one of the most polluted of dozens of cities in the UK that breach EU standards on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a toxic gas caused by diesel vehicles. Air pollution has been  in the city each year.Funding for air quality measures over the next five years will be more than doubled to ?875m, under plans announced on Wednesday, up from the ?425m committed under the former mayor Boris Johnson. If approved at a Transport for London board meeting next week, most of the money 每 ?312m 每 will be spent on cleaning up TfL＊s 9,300-strong bus fleet. A further ?65m will be used to compensate and encourage taxi drivers to switch from the oldest black cabs 每 those more than 10 years old 每 to new ones capable of zero emissions, . Local neighbourhood schemes will receive ?14m for tackling some of the worst pollution hotspots outside the city centre. Plans will also be published next year to cut the number of buses running along Oxford Street, which researchers .Khan said: ※With nearly 10,000 Londoners dying early every year due to air pollution, tackling poor air quality is a public health emergency that requires bold action. I want  to be a world leader in how we respond to the challenge of cleaning up our air, and today I＊m announcing that TfL will be doubling spending on improving London＊s air over the next five years.§The new money comes days after the mayors of four major world cities 每 Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City 每 . Khan＊s plans stops short of that, though the mayor is bringing in an ※ultra low emissions zone§ a year earlier than planned and . Owners of older diesel cars will have to pay ?12.50 on top of the existing congestion charge to enter the zone.The extra funding was welcomed by campaigners, though some called on the mayor to go further and ban diesel vehicles.※Good job Sadiq,§ said Simon Birkett, founder and director of Clean Air in London, but added: ※We won＊t be happy though till you ban diesel in London by 2020.§Friends of the Earth London campaigner Sophie Neuburg said: ※This cash injection from the mayor is great news for Londoners forced to suffer the impacts of the capital＊s filthy air.§ But she also called for Khan to follow the other cities and ban diesel vehicles. Dr Samantha Walker, Asthma UK＊s director of research and policy, said: ※It is clear that action is needed and we welcome the extra investment to help clean up the air we breathe.§The mayor also repeated his call on the government to do more to improve air quality, including introducing a scrappage scheme for the most polluting cars, a measure that officials have ruled out. On Tuesday, children and the British Lung Foundation delivered a petition signed by more than 20,000 people to 10 Downing Street urging more action on dirty air."																																																			
"oments before the US president, , strode into the Rose Garden, TV cameras pictured his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, shaking hands and looking generally pleased with himself.Bannon once called global warming a ※§.Bannon, with Trump＊s head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, were among the loudest and most forceful voices in Trump＊s ear, imploring the president to pull out of the Paris climate change agreement. During his speech, Trump claimed the Paris deal was bad for America. The themes were economic, but the speech was laced with jingoistic protectionism.※Our withdrawal represents a reassertion of America＊s sovereignty,§ he said.But make no mistake here.The foundation for Trump＊s dismissal of the Paris deal 每 and for the people who pushed him the hardest to do it 每 is the rejection of the science linking fossil-fuel burning to dangerous climate change. Or rather, Trump＊s rejection of the Paris deal was built on the flimsy, cherry-picked and long-debunked talking points of an industry built to manufacture doubt about climate science. Once you fall for those arguments, making an economic case suddenly feels plausible.After Trump signed off with his catchphrase pledge glib enough to fit on a baseball cap, he invited Pruitt to say a few words.Pruitt, who as the attorney general of Oklahoma had a long history of backing fossil-fuel interests over environmental concerns, has Bannon is the former boss of Breitbart 每 the hyper-partisan right-wing outlet that pushes climate science denial and an overt hatred for climate scientists.As , Trump＊s team has been filling the administration with climate science ※sceptics§.Myron Ebell, the man picked by the Trump campaign team to engineer the EPA＊s transition from an agency that acknowledges the risk of fossil-fuel burning to one being forced to publicly deny it, is a long-serving member of that climate science denial industry. As long ago as 1998, Ebell  for a campaign that aimed to  from acceptance to doubt.Moments after Trump＊s announcement, Steve Milloy, one of Ebell＊s colleagues in that 1998 campaign who was also drafted by Ebell to help him ※transition§ the EPA, tweeted: ※Congratulations to all climate skeptics! We have reaped a tremendous victory.§Earlier this week, the veteran coal lobbyist  over Trump＊s intentions.※Stay on the course that recognizes the Paris agreement incorrectly demonizes carbon and CO2 emissions,§ wrote Palmer, who is now a senior fellow at the climate science-denying Heartland Institute.Palmer has explained to me how some 25 years ago  aimed squarely at undermining the science linking fossil-fuel burning to dangerous climate change. Since then, elements of the fossil-fuel industry have run a relentless campaign of self-interested misinformation that puts the protection of their industry above the protection of communities, habitats and species across the planet.They got together with so-called ※free market§ advocates whose view on the world tells them governments have to be small and that regulations are bad.Just weeks ago, a collective of conservative ※free market§ organisations wrote an open letter to Trump urging him to cut ties with the Paris deal.The first name on the letter was Ebell＊s. Many signatories reject entirely the role of fossil-fuel burning in changing the climate. Many of the groups those people represent have  from the petrochemical billionaires Charles and David Koch.Those groups are the same ones who have developed talking points, compiled reports, appeared in the media, written newspaper columns, gone on speaking torus, given testimony to congress 每 all geared to protecting the fossil-fuel industry while relegating, ignoring or misrepresenting the science.Several members of that denial industry 每 including Ebell 每 were  to hear the news.As Rhode Island senator and Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse said in the moments after Trump＊s announcement, Trump ※is betraying the country, in service of Breitbart fake news, the fossil fuel industry, & the Koch brothers＊ climate denial operation.§So what comes next? Hopefully, one realisation will be this. Now is the time to learn about the methods, the tactics, the personnel, the structure and the reach of the global climate science denial industry.They just convinced the leader of the United States to pull the plug on a historic deal signed by almost 200 countries, and instead join Nicaragua and Syria as the only countries not signed up.It is time to take that climate science denial industry seriously.

They are almost unimpeded by land except for the tip of South America and the southern end of New Zealand＊s South Island.These winds play a major role in Earth＊s climate, helping to regulate the carbon dioxide exchange between the deep ocean and atmosphere, and influencing rainfall, temperature and sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere. Now scientists have uncovered a 17,000-year history of these shifting winds, sitting at the bottom of a  lake bed.Last year, Gavin Dunbar and colleagues from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand drilled deep into the sediments underlying  每 a lake that lies to the east of New Zealand＊s Southern Alps, and underneath the path of the Roaring Forties. In recent decades, growth of the ozone hole has forced the winds to shift southwards, resulting in summer rains decreasing by as much as 40% in southern New Zealand. This is reflected in the lake sediments, which accumulate when heavy rains wash them down the slopes of the nearby mountains.The scientists extracted 80m of layered sediments, and radiocarbon dated twigs and leaves in the sediment to reveal 17,000 years of climate history. Using data they had gathered over the last seven years, Dunbar and his colleagues were able to calibrate the sediment layers and recognise the difference between dry summers (millimetre scale couplets of fine silt) and flood events (centimetre thick silt layers). Their findings . Now the scientists are working through the sediments layer by layer, listening to the howling of ancient winds."																																																			
"For a president who prizes personal chemistry, a day and a half cloistered with the leaders of the six major capitalist economies in the medieval Sicilian coastal town of Taormina might seem attractive 每 even if it marks a come-down from Mar-a-Lago.But no one knows if , reaching the end of an exhausting week-long tour, will take to world summitry. Multilateral fora would not seem his natural habitat: he is hardly likely to be interested in the dense final communiques these meetings tend to produce 每 and which remain largely unread by anyone but the functionaries who toiled over every ambiguous sub-paragraph. There are few specific deals to be made, just frank views to be exchanged and understandings reached. The format is deliberately informal, if not unstructured. And the absence of  and China may make Trump question the G7＊s continued relevance.Moreover, the prospect of Trump being totally alone with his six interlocutors will certainly cause palpitations amongst the officials listening to the discussion on headphones in an adjoining room. Few can predict the course of his conversation, the span of his concentration or .The risk is that 每 on a range of agenda items 每 Trump finds himself in the G1. His six colleagues, with varying degrees of emphasis, are likely to want to change his instincts on climate change, protectionism, the treatment of refugees and novel ideas like a web tax on the giant technology companies. Japan will be seeking a tougher strategy on North Korea＊s nuclear ambitions.According to diplomats, the leaders have been exchanging views on how best to engage Trump, or locate the true figures of influence in the White House. One diplomat said: ※We need to show a degree of humility. In foreign policy terms, the second half of Trump＊s 100 days were immeasurably better than the first half, recognisably Republican. The trick is to make sure he does not feel cornered, and if you have an idea, make him feel it is his idea, and in America＊s interest. At the same time, we need to get some commitments from him.§The team around  每 one of four leaders attending his first G7 每 say they will be pressing Trump hard on the argument that the US cannot afford to backtrack on the agreements Barack Obama . In some ways, it is a replay of the arguments the G7 staged with George W Bush at the start of the decade.Some western powers are trying to frame the climate change discussion as a national security argument, pointing to the risk of war and terrorism if mass migration explodes out of drought-ridden Africa.Trump＊s aides insist he remains in listening mode on climate change, and no decision will be made for a few weeks. The British, eternal optimists, at least sense he is moving on the issue. Results may have to wait for the G20 summit, to be attended by  in Hamburg in June.It may be a tougher ask to get Trump to sign up to words extolling the virtues of free trade 每 standard fare in  communiques since its inception in 1975, but anathema to Trump＊s protectionist tax-cutting instincts. Time has been set aside for a lengthy debate on Friday evening. Angela Merkel 每 facing elections this year 每 cannot be seen to cave to a man who is political kryptonite among her voters.Equally, Italy＊s prime minister, Paulo Gentiloni, supported by Merkel, will want to broaden Trump＊s perception of fighting terrorism, an issue made more urgent by the . Gentiloni wants the US to look at the way in which climate, migration and security are increasingly intertwined.The seven leaders will be looking out at the Mediterranean 每 a sea which this year alone  as they attempt to reach Europe from Libya. About 50,000 have reached Italy, a figure large enough to suggest more than 200,000 migrants will arrive in the country this year. Italy feels strongly that it has been left alone to handle a crisis in which the accidents of geography have handed it an excessive burden.But  is also eager to discuss the root causes of African migration. So the discussion will go wider than Libya＊s political stability, coastal patrols, or even closing migration routes to address how to foster economic innovation in Africa.The vast cuts announced by the White House this week in the US foreign aid budget run counter to this, and an Italian plan for an African food security fund at the summit has been scaled back. Trump will meet five African leaders from Tunisia, Niger, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Kenya.The presence of Japan＊s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will also ensure  get high billing. If North Korea is only two years away from gaining an intercontinental weapon, as many experienced diplomats believe, this becomes an issue that Trump and most of the other G7 leaders know they will have to address on their watch. The speed of Pyongyang＊s progress with missile technology is alarming all sides.At issue is whether the G7 should seek to engage or instead persuade China to bring the regime of Kim Jong Un to its knees by cutting off oil supplies, risking a dangerous chaos, and mass refugee flows.Experienced Korean diplomats privately say the chances of the current standoff ending peacefully are limited, as low as 10%, and predict North Korea will have intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking Washington within two years. Despairing diplomats hope that Trump＊s unpredictability may prove to be an asset in the crisis since his personality will make an anxious  unable to forecast his next move.That same anxiety, of course, is shared in a different way by the other members of the G7, and the intrigue in the two days ahead may lie in the extent to which Trump manages to reassure or instead deepen concern about the ※leader of the free world§."																																																			
"Londoners are backing Sadiq Khan＊s plans to crack down on air pollution in the capital, with more than 70 per cent of residents supporting plans to bring forward measures to restrict polluting vehicles in the city, according to the results of the Mayor＊s air quality consultation.Some 15,000 people responded to the Mayor＊s office air quality consultation this summer - the highest number of responses to a City Hall consultation ever. Nearly 80 per cent of respondents said they supported Khan＊s plans to bring forward the introduction of the Ultra Low Emission Zone - currently due to enter force in 2020 - to 2019, while 71 per cent said the zone should be expanded to encompass the north and south circular.Londoners also strongly backed an early ?10 Emissions Surcharge, dubbed the ※T-charge§, on high polluting vehicles entering the capital＊s centre from 2017. More than 80 per cent of people backed this measure, which would apply to most cars registered before 2005. City Hall said it will now start to consider the practicalities of implementing the T-charge in more detail, ready for introduction next year.Evidence suggests almost 9,500 Londoners die every year from long-term exposure to air pollution, while 443 schools in the capital are located in areas with poor air quality.※A record number of Londoners responded to our consultation, which demonstrates they feel just as strongly as I do that cleaning up the capital＊s killer air has to be a major priority,§ Khan said in a statement. ※Both the previous Mayor and the government failed to get their act together to meet legal pollution limits and that＊s why I have put forward some bold, hard-hitting measures to tackle this issue head on. I will consider the consultation findings in more detail before deciding on the next steps.§Earlier this week Khan set out a new action plan for London＊s taxis, including the introduction of a new scrappage scheme for the oldest taxis from next year. Up to ?5,000 will be available to drivers who retire their vehicles, Khan pledged, with ?3,000 available towards the purchase of a new zero emission capable (ZEC) cab. Meanwhile, drivers of ZEC taxis will receive exclusive access to facilities such as green cab ranks.Khan called on the government to introduce a nationwide diesel scrappage scheme for all vehicles, which proved popular with consultation respondents. ※Londoners were clear that government needs to do its bit to help meet the new ULEZ standards and that it should fund a scrappage scheme. government now needs to listen to Londoners and work with me to deliver a national diesel scrappage scheme,§ he added.It echoes calls made in April by MPs who  and urged the government to take urgent action to crack down on pollution by introducing more clean air zones and a diesel scrappage scheme.However, in the government＊s  to the MPs＊ report, published yesterday, it rejected calls for a national scrappage scheme. ※We have considered the use of scrappage schemes both linked to the purchase of ultra low emission vehicles and more generally and have concluded that this may not be an appropriate and proportionate response to the challenges we face, as air quality exceedances are often localised and can be managed in other ways,§ the response said.Instead, the government insists its plan of introducing Clean Air Zones in cities across the UK, as well as investment in low-emission vehicles, the introduction of charging networks and measures to cut pollution from industry and agriculture, is adequate.The response sparked anger from air quality campaigners. ※Despite the mounting evidence of the dangers people face having to breathe our illegally dirty air, the government is refusing to take the bold action needed to cut the 40,000 early deaths from air pollution each year in the UK,§ Friends of the Earth air quality campaigner Jenny Bates said in a statement. ※Road traffic is the biggest problem for air pollution and diesel is the worst of all. We urgently need the government to put in place a plan to phase out diesel from our roads. A carefully-designed scrappage scheme would be an important step to help people switch away from dirty diesel vehicles - but the government has today rejected this vital recommendation.§"																																																			
"n the safe, sanitised world of the multiplex, where product placement and brand partnerships reign supreme, it＊s rare to see a mainstream film with the guts to double as a takedown of a multi-billion dollar company. But, after watching Peter Berg＊s surprisingly yet deservedly angry restaging of the 2010 , which caused 11 deaths and the biggest oil spill in history, it＊ll take a minor PR miracle to restore the average moviegoer＊s faith in BP.On paper, Berg is a poor choice for the material. His last film at sea was Battleship, a soulless, swaggering Transformers knock-off based on a board game, and his last with star Mark Wahlberg was the viscerally effective but heavy-handed Navy Seals drama . He also tried and failed to make something resembling an issues movie with the forgettable Saudi-set actioner The Kingdom. But for the most part in this effective disaster thriller, he keeps the flag-waving jingoism to a minimum, to focus on the devastating tragedy at hand.Wahlberg stars as Mike Williams, an engineer who heads off to sea, leaving his wife (Kate Hudson) and daughter at home. It seems like business as usual as he makes his way to , an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, but once aboard, there is uncomfortable tension. His senior, a gruff Kurt Russell, is warring with visiting BP execs, who insist a drilling operation go ahead despite safety concerns. The most ruthless suit, a drawling John Malkovich, appears unmoved by complaints about faulty equipment and unfinished checks.When the work begins, under protest, it soon becomes clear there are major problems at play, and soon men are fighting for their lives on a burning oil rig in the middle of the sea.There＊s no denying the harrowing nature of the story being told, but Berg is admirably, uncharacteristically restrained. Wahlberg＊s family dynamic is briskly yet believably constructed, and we＊re spared some of the more cliched moments we＊d usually expect in this kind of film. There＊s no heavy signposting or emotional goodbye when he sets off for the rig. And once we＊re at sea, the dialogue is terse, tense and delivers often complex technical minutiae clearly, without anything feeling as if it has been dumbed down. The film also squarely, and quite rightly, places the blame for the disaster at BP＊s door. Without turning them into moustache-twirling villains, we see its representatives callously place profits over potential loss of human life and environmental damage. I can＊t recall a film that＊s been quite so brave or clear in its untainted bile for one particular company (※money-hungry sonsabitches§). When all hell breaks loose, Berg stages the action horribly well, capturing the panic and gruesome mayhem without the film ever feeling exploitative. It＊s spectacularly constructed, yet it doesn＊t forget about the loss of life, ensuring that, despite thin characterisation, the impact is felt. Sentiment is kept at bay, and it＊s only a treacly country song at the end, over an otherwise powerful photographic tribute, that feels a bit clumsy. Wahlberg, again, makes for a solid everyman, and there＊s a nice decision, late in the film, to focus on his shock back on land rather than a sugary reunion with his family. Russell and Malkovich riff on types they＊ve played before, but with predictable skill, while Jane the Virgin breakout Gina Rodriguez makes the most of a small role as a young worker who calls for help.Deepwater Horizon is a gruelling disaster movie and a reminder of one company＊s catastrophic oversights, and it stands as a worthy tribute to the brave men involved."																																																			
"Newborn humpback whales and their mothers whisper to each other to escape potential predators, scientists reported Wednesday, revealing the existence of a previously unknown survival technique.※They don＊t want any unwanted listeners,§ researcher Simone Videsen, lead author of a study published in Functional Ecology, said. ※Potential predators such as killer whales could listen to their conversations and use that as a cue to locate the calf and predate on it.§ are known for their loud calls, congregating fellow members of the pod. Male humpback whales also emit reverberating sounds to attract females during the mating season.But this is the first time scientists have observed a unique, intimate form of communication between humpback mothers and calves.Researchers from Denmark and Australia tracked each of eight calves and two mothers for 24 hours in Exmouth Gulf, , a breeding ground for Antarctic humpback whales seeking warmer waters to mate and give birth.Using tags attached to the animals, the team of scientists recorded their faint squeaks and grunts.※These signals between mother and calf are more quiet than those of normal adult humpback whales,§ Videsen said, noting they were 40 decibels lower than the singing of males in the area. While a male＊s cry can resound over an area covering several kilometres, the pairs in the study could only hear each others＊ calls within a distance of less than 100 metres (330 feet), she added.The low sounds were detected when the pairs were swimming, suggesting the discreet tone helps the mammals stay together in the murky breeding waters, infested with killer whales preying on stray calves.The faint sounds are also a way to keep mate-seeking males from interfering in the humpback＊s nurturing, a crucial time in the newborn＊s life as it braces for an arduous 8,000km (5,000 mile) journey back home to the Antarctic, the researchers speculated.And the migration is no less challenging for the mother.※There is no food for them in the breeding grounds so the mothers feast while they are there,§ Videsen said.The researchers also believe that mother and calf 每 in their effort to go undetected 每 may have developed a silent method to initiate suckling. Instead of signalling hunger vocally and risk getting spotted, the calves ※rub against their mothers§, according to the study＊s findings.Humpback whales can be found both in the Arctic and Antarctic. Each pod spends the summer at the poles and travels to tropical areas in their respective hemispheres during the winter to breed.The scientific investigation also shed light on the growing problem of ocean noise pollution that can severely disrupt marine life.※Because mother and calf communicate in whispers, shipping noise could easily mask these quiet calls,§ Videsen said, potentially provoking the pair to lose each other."																																																			
"The contribution of diesel exhaust to summer smog has been a topic of hot debate over the last six years.Not all air pollution comes directly from sources such as traffic, heating and industry. Pollutants are also created from chemical reactions in the atmosphere. This is especially true in summer when stronger sunlight provides extra energy to drive the chemistry. During this July＊s hot weather, air drifted over France and the UK, accumulating pollutants that then reacted in the sunshine. The resulting summertime smog reached six on the UK government＊s ten point warning scale.Many thousands of different types of pollutant gases and particles can be formed under these conditions. Exhaust from petrol cars played a major role in creating the  and the  and 1980s. Our traffic has changed a lot since this time. Petrol exhausts have been controlled by catalysts but we now have much more diesel traffic.Four years ago  pointed to particle pollution being created by chemical reactions from petrol exhaust, but  have suggested that diesel is the culprit. Attention has now focused on highly chemically reactive hydrocarbons in diesel exhaust that react to produce other pollutants. These are hard to measure, but  show that some emissions are over 70 times more than expected and that . Vehicle manufactures need to address these to eliminate the health-harm from the diesel vehicles that they sell. "																																																			
"t is 14 years since the  killed 2,000 people in southern England and the alarm was raised about hot weather being as dangerous for vulnerable people as winter cold.Since then a  has been put in place that will inform people when the temperature is likely to exceed 30C for a day and a night. Weather forecast warnings of an imminent heatwave ask that vulnerable people take steps to keep cool. and care homes are supposed to provide a ※cool room§ for those most at risk. The last such warning was given in August 2016.But scientists are concerned that this is nowhere near enough to protect the public because, even in moderately warm weather, some places can become dangerously hot. Researchers at : ※Overheating in UK homes is a public health disaster waiting to happen.§They say this is partly because the government has concentrated its regulations on insulating homes to keep people warm in winter, thereby making them more likely to overheat in summer. This plus poor design of houses and more high-rise building has made many homes uncomfortably warm even in mild summers. Tests show that hospital wards and homes for the elderly are among the most dangerous places in a heatwave.Loughborough says new regulations are required to improve design. This means providing easy-to-open windows and shading to keep out the sun. A public education plan is also needed so people know to open windows at night to let in cool air and close them during the day to keep the heat out.

"The EU has approved a $130bn mega-merger between Dow and , heralding a new round of agribusiness takeovers that environmentalists fear will endanger the future of sustainable food production.Brussels is widely expected to clear another hookup between Syngenta and ChemChina in the next two weeks, with notification of a marriage between Monsanto and Bayer expected later in the year.As a condition for Monday＊s deal, DuPont will have to sell off large parts of its global pesticides business, including almost all of its global research and development group.But the US agrichem giant is the second biggest global seed supplier after Monsanto 每 Dow is the fifth 每 and green groups fear that just three mega-corporations could soon be left exercising ※a toxic grip§ over the world＊s food and countryside.Adrian Bebb, a spokesperson for Friends of the Earth, said: ※This merger will mean a lack of choice for farmers and a lack of diversity in our fields. We rapidly need to diversify our farming to adapt to a changing climate, and having less seeds controlled by fewer corporation raises serious questions about our ability to feed future generations.§ sent to the commission by an alliance of 200 environmental groups on Monday says that about 60% of commercial seed supplies will be centralised in the hands of just three multinationals if the mergers are all approved. The commission though believes that the line it has laid down by enforcing pesticides divestment will help to prevent higher prices or restrictions to market choice, while safeguarding innovation and pesticide safety.Speaking in Brussels on Monday, the EU competition commissioner, , said: ※This is literally a question about our daily bread and the ability for farmers to choose different seeds and different pesticides, in order to secure their crops. It is the heart of human life, so we take it very seriously.§Regulators in the US and China will still have to approve the Dow-DuPont deal, but Monday＊s EU decision is being seen by some analysts as a marker for future deals. Patrick Worms, a senior science policy adviser at the world agroforestry centre, cautioned that sustainable agriculture depended on a plurality of seed sources, farming methods and competing suppliers.※Corporate behemoths can＊t deliver that,§ he said. ※They are smothered by processes, bureaucracies, and internal politics.

"The wholesale price of raw legal ivory has dropped by almost two thirds since China, the world＊s largest ivory importer and trader, announced plans to close down its domestic market, according to new .Researchers working for the conservation organisation  visited Beijing and Shanghai, as well as six cities whose markets had never been surveyed before: Changzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shenyang, Suzhou and Tianjin. The researchers, Lucy Vigne and Esmond Martin, concluded that the legal trade in ivory is dying. In early 2014, the average wholesale price of tusks was $2,100 (?1,700) per kg, the researchers found. By late 2015, just months after  symbolically burned half a ton of stockpiled ivory and announced plans to end the domestic trade, the price had fallen to $1,100 per kg. By February 2017 it had reached just $730 per kg.The research team also found that many retail shops were closed or closing with vendors trying to offload stocks. The legal shops have been sitting on old stocks of worked ivory trying to sell items for the same prices to recoup the high costs of purchasing raw ivory.Some conservationists have welcomed the latest findings. ※We must give credit to China for having done the right thing by closing the ivory trade,§ said Iain Douglas-Hamilton, president and founder of Save the Elephants. ※There is now greater hope for the species.§ Elephant populations have been crashing in the last few years; a  of savannah elephants published at the end of last year showed them down by a third of a total population 每 or 144,000 elephants 每 over seven years directly as a result of the ivory trade. A separate analysis by the , which also included a survey of forest elephant populations, revealed a similar pattern. The drop in the prices has been attributed, in part, to the Chinese government＊s public commitment to close down the nation＊s legal ivory trade. ※With the end of the legal ivory trade in China the survival chances for elephants have distinctly improved,§ said Douglas-Hamilton.China＊s ivory factories are to be officially shut down by 31 March 2017, and all retail outlets will be closed by the end of the year. There have been intensive public awareness campaigns that have involved celebrities such as actor Jackie Chan and shown Chinese consumers that buying ivory is having a negative impact on Africa＊s elephant populations. However, the main reason for the decline, says the report, is the Chinese economic slowdown. Late last year  suggested that growth prospects in the world＊s second largest economy remain gloomy. Consumer spending, even though it had improved on the previous year, is not picking up as much as China would hope. Hardest hit are more expensive luxury materials such as raw ivory.And the reduction in prices may not have as big an impact as many hope. Professor Alejandro Nadal, an economist from the Centre for Economic Studies, El Colegio de M谷xico, warned we must not jump to conclusions. ※The key variable that will determine the effect on poaching is not prices. It is profits,§ he said.Nadal believes that selling ivory at low wholesale prices could spell higher profit levels at the retail end of the chain. So even though wholesale prices have dropped, ivory retailers therefore could see their profitability increase. Nadal asks whether its these big retail traders who are driving the poaching: ※To get a better answer to that question, we need to know more about the links with the illegal trade: do the price reductions affect the prices in the illegal trade?§In fact, the research found that illegal ivory traders, by contrast to the legal outlets, have indeed benefitted from falling prices. The researchers discovered that the illegal dealers have been buying raw illegal ivory for less and selling items quickly at much reduced prices compared with legal businesses, undercutting them. ※While legal dealers have suffered, illegal traders have been enjoying a profitable business,§ the report concludes."																																																			
"The UK breached EU law by allowing a coal-fired power station to emit too much air pollution, the court of justice (CJEU) has said.In a reasoned opinion, published on 28 June, the CJEU said the UK＊s defence of how it regulated Aberthaw power station did not stack up and it should be forced to pay legal costs.The European commission  to court last year, on the grounds that not enough had been done to address excessive emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from coal-fired Aberthaw in the Vale of Glamorgan. It had first raised concerns in .The plant＊s permitted NOx emission limit was reduced from 1,200 milligrams per normal cubic metres to 1,100mg/Nm3 in 2012, but this was still well above the 500mg/Nm3 limit set in the EU＊s large combustion plant directive 每 now part of the  (IED). From 1 January 2016, the limit dropped even further to 200mg/Nm3.Defra and the Welsh government claimed that they could use an exemption in the law for plants burning solid fuels whose volatile content is less than 10%. They argued that this exemption was specifically designed for plants such as Aberthaw which uses locally sourced anthracitic coal that is more difficult to burn and is economically important to the local area.They added that Aberthaw＊s operator RWE was investing in the plant and its NOx emissions were expected to fall to 450mg/Nm3 by the end of 2017.But the court was not convinced. It pointed out that the annual average volatile content of Aberthaw coal was above the 10% limit and said there was no official evidence that the exemption was designed with Aberthaw in mind.The next step is a formal judgment from the court. If it agrees, which is likely, Defra and the Welsh government will have to change how Aberthaw is regulated to comply with the rule as soon as possible. If they do not, they face being dragged back to court and could be fined. The CJEU also recommended that the UK should pay the European commission＊s legal costs.Aberthaw has also been a major sticking point in UK discussions with the EU over a plan to  from large power plants.In the end Aberthaw was excluded from the plan, and would only be reinstated the UK wins its case in the CJEU. Since that looks unlikely to happen, the plant may be at risk of closing.Brexit may prove a complication in future but for the moment the UK is still bound by CJEU rulings."																																																			
"The fingerprint of human-caused climate change has been found on heatwaves, droughts and floods across the world, according to scientists.The discovery indicates that the impacts of global warming are already being felt by society and adds further urgency to the need to cut carbon emissions. A key factor is , which is now  across Europe, Asia and north America. Rising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have long been expected to lead to increasing extreme weather events, as they trap extra energy in the atmosphere. But linking global warming to particular events is difficult because the climate is naturally variable.The new work analysed a type of extreme weather event known to be caused by changes in ※planetary waves§ 每 such as California＊s ongoing record drought, and recent heatwaves in the US and Russia, as well as severe floods in Pakistan in 2010.Planetary waves are a pattern of winds, of which the jet stream is a part, that encircle the northern hemisphere in lines that undulate from the tropics to the poles. Normally, the whole wave moves eastwards but, under certain temperature conditions, the wave can halt its movement. This leaves whole regions under the same weather for extended periods, which can turn hot spells into heatwaves and wet weather into floods.This type of extreme weather event is known to have increased in recent decades. But the new research used observations and climate models to show that the chances of the conditions needed to halt the planetary waves occurring are significantly more likely as a result of global warming.※Human activity has been suspected of contributing to this pattern before, but now we uncover a clear fingerprint of human activity,§ said Prof Michael Mann, at Pennsylvania State University in the US and who led the . Kai Kornhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany and another member of the research team, said: ※We looked into dozens of different climate models, as well as into observational data, and it turns out that the temperature distribution favouring planetary wave stalling increased in almost 70% of the simulations.§Large scale wind patterns are largely driven by the temperature difference between the poles and the tropics. But global warming is altering this difference because the  than lower latitudes and because land areas are heating up faster than the oceans.Recent changes in the Arctic are particularly striking, with  and extremely unusual high temperatures. ※Things in the Arctic are happening much faster than we expected,§ said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, also at PIK. ※It is not just a problem of nature conservation or polar bears, it is about a threat to human society that comes from these rapid changes,§ he said. ※This is because it hits us with increasing extreme events in the highly populated centres in the mid-latitudes. It also affects us through sea level rise, which is hitting shores globally. So these changes that are going on in the  should concern everyone.§Other climate research, called attribution, is increasingly able to calculate how much more likely specific extreme weather events have been made by global warming. For example, the heatwave in south-eastern Australia in February was made , while Storm Desmond, which caused heavy flooding in the UK in 2015, ."																																																			
"Media Matters for America has published , and the results are stunning:In all of 2016, these news programs spent a combined grand total of 50 minutes talking about climate change. More than half of that come from  Evening News, which nevertheless only spent half as much time talking about climate change in 2016 as it had in 2015.It＊s certainly not as though 2016 lacked newsworthy climate stories.

In fact, on Sunday news programs, Bernie Sanders brought up climate change four times more often than the program hosts.Only  the election did news networks finally examine what a President Trump would mean for the Earth＊s climate:As Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) noted, this was a dismal failure by the American news networks:PBS was the oasis in this desert of climate news coverage. PBS NewsHour was the only show that examined what impact a Trump or a Clinton presidency would have on climate-related issues and policies before the election. The PBS news program aired more than double the number of climate news segments as any of its network competitors, and interviewed or quoted three times more scientists than even CBS Evening News.  World News Tonight failed to interview or quote a single scientist about climate change.Perhaps unsurprisingly given his climate denial, , which partially funds PBS. About half of that federal funding . Some of those stations 每 especially those in rural areas which rely particularly heavily on federal funding 每 would likely have to shut down, were Trump to get his budgetary wish.With so little news coverage on the subject, it＊s also unsurprising  每 just 49% of Americans realize that most scientists think global warming is happening, and only 53% understand that humans are causing the problem. , only 64% worry a great deal or fair amount. That＊s entirely understandable 每 if our leaders deny the problem, and our news networks don＊t report on it, Americans are lacking the information signaling that global warming is an urgent threat. That＊s why, although Americans () would prefer that their political leaders take steps to address the problem, they don＊t few it as a high priority, and thus aren＊t bothered by the lack of political action.When future generations look back in disbelief at our failure to take the needed steps to preserve a stable climate, the history books will take a harsh view of today＊s media outlets and political leaders who refused to inform the public or protect its health and welfare in the face of such an immense known threat."																																																			
																																																			
"The key crossbench senator  has signalled publicly to the Turnbull government he will look at cutting tax for big companies if the government guarantees it will implement a bipartisan emissions intensity trading scheme in the electricity sector.The NXT leader has been saying for months he is not inclined to support tax cuts for business with annual turnover of more than $10m but, on Monday, suggested he would come to the table if the government made a concrete offer on energy policy.Xenophon criticised the government for walking away from an intensity scheme for electricity, which had been championed by  in the late 2000s.※Not only has the opposition come on side?, the CSIRO looking at it scientifically, have all said an emissions intensity approach is the best and, in fact, I think the only way forward to get us out of this crisis,§ Xenophon told reporters in Canberra on Monday.Asked for specifics about what he was looking for from the government as a quid pro quo in any company tax cut negotiations, Xenophon said he would be looking for ※a guarantee [on an emissions intensity scheme] that is locked in in terms of bipartisan support§.※You would actually unleash billions of dollars of investment in this country but, as part of the equation, it could be a significant part of the jigsaw.§He also called for a ※national approach§ on gas to ensure domestic supply at reasonable prices and suggested the government should look at a Queensland scheme that reserves a certain area for development for domestic gas supply only.Xenophon said the businesses he spoke to in South Australia were much more focused on getting the problems in the Australian energy market fixed than on getting ※marginal relief§ from a tax cut.While he has been telegraphing interest in energy policy for some months, the NXT leader＊s comments on Monday are the most specific and explicit he has given in terms of a wish list in any company tax cut discussion with the government.The Turnbull government wants consideration of its $48bn corporate tax cut package this week. The package is currently in the House of Representatives and this week is the final parliamentary sitting week before the May budget.After recent speculation that the government might split the package in order to legislate at least some of the reforms, the  he will pursue the full package.The government＊s business tax package is .The first tranche would cut the tax rate for small businesses with annual turnover of less than $10m to 27.5% for the 2016-17 financial year.The government then wants to progressively extend that lower rate to all businesses by the 2023-24 financial year and further reduce the corporate tax rate in stages so that, by the 2026-27 financial year, the corporate tax rate for all businesses will be 25%.The package has been deadlocked politically for months because the government lacks the requisite Senate support to cut the tax rate for big businesses from 30% to 25%.Xenophon＊s ask on emissions trading hits an acute point of sensitivity within the Coalition. The government  last December after a brief internal revolt. Various conservatives, and the frontbench moderate Christopher Pyne, insisted the Coalition could not adopt any climate policy that included carbon trading.Senior government players have continued to publicly rule out an intensity trading scheme as a number of influential business groups and energy market experts have used the Finkel review of energy policy to argue in favour of such a scheme on the basis it would lower emissions in the electricity sector at least cost to households and businesses.A string of peak bodies have already called on the Coalition to adopt a market mechanism to drive the transition to lower emissions power sources in electricity, including ,  and the Business Council of Australia, which  scheme.The current consensus around carbon pricing is a major turnaround in a very short period of time. Three years ago,? so that Tony Abbott could repeal the Gillard government＊s so-called ※carbon tax§.While the government has been keen to telegraph the message it will not allow emissions trading in the electricity sector, a new discussion paper released by the government last Friday to help inform a scheduled review of its heavily criticised Direct Action climate policy  about what policies might be required to drive the transition to lower emissions technologies in Australia＊s energy sector.With power prices a continuing political problem for the government, Turnbull government on Monday  to scrutinise the behaviour of electricity retailers, and the contracts offered to residential and business customers, to ensure Australians are benefiting from competition.Xenophon said the new ACCC inquiry wasn＊t enough to deal with the current problems and the country required swifter action.The prime minister, speaking to reporters on Monday, left open the idea retail electricity prices could be regulated as a consequence of the review to give consumers and businesses relief.Turnbull said there was a lot of regulation in the electricity market already but the government was expecting the Finkel review to recommend some changes in the regulatory arrangements.※You＊ll no doubt see recommendations from this ACCC review and we will obviously take them all on board and consider them very carefully,§ the prime minister said Monday."																																																			
"Clive Hamilton has been at the pointy end of public discourse on climate change for more than 20 years.Among lots of other things, he＊s written challenging books on the science, founded a progressive thinktank and had a failed crack at being an MP for the Greens.He got his  medal for his contributions on climate and sustainability almost eight years ago. His book Scorcher: The Dirty Politics of Climate Change is now a decade old. In 2012, Hamilton was appointed to the Australian government＊s Climate Change Authority (CCA) 每 a body charged with making recommendations to government on climate policy in line with the science.But last month, Hamilton quit the CCA after hearing a chorus of government ministers, led by the prime minister, , touting the oxymoron of ※clean coal§.Now Hamilton has spelled out his antipathy towards Turnbull 每 a politician who only six years ago was a climate change hawk, who , and who was utterly sceptical of ※clean coal§.In an  for my podcast, , Hamilton gives a withering personal assessment of the prime minister and reveals what was going on inside the CCA before his resignation. ※I wasn＊t disappointed, or upset,§ says Hamilton on Turnbull＊s , ※I was disgusted.§ ※For Turnbull to be using that outrageous term [clean coal] to describe coal-fired power stations 每 I was disgusted.§※It＊s a tragedy to watch a man like Malcolm Turnbull to shrink into the kind of shell of a person that he has become. I don＊t understand why a man like that does not say ＆look, I have some fundamental principles and I might lose the leadership but at least I will be able to look at myself in the mirror for the rest of my life.＊§ Hamilton points out that a decade ago Turnbull was pledging he would ※not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.§ ※The truth is that he now does lead a Liberal party that has the same views as he does on climate change,§ says Hamilton. ※The Liberal party has undergone a transformation in the last 10 years and it＊s now dominated federally by troglodytes from the hard right 每 the anti-science brigade, some of whom probably cheered when Pauline Hanson attacked vaccinations the other day. These are the anti-science, anti-expertise crowd 〞 the kind of people who now advise Donald Trump.§Trump＊s election, believes Hamilton, has galvanised climate science deniers around the world, including those in Turnbull＊s party.※I think that [climate science] deniers now are more inclined to believe they were right and history is on their side and this whole thing will be shown to be a hoax and a scandal 每 that does embolden them and undoubtedly that＊s a factor in Turnbull＊s partyroom.§Hamilton publicly resigned from the CCA last month, citing as a final straw the government＊s advocacy for coal. That＊s public knowledge. But in the , Hamilton tells me the problems seemed to start in October 2015 when the new Turnbull government  to the authority. ※The whole character of the authority changed,§ Hamilton says. After that point, the CCA was ※dominated by people who want action, but not too much action.§In a story from inside the CCA, Hamilton says: ※There was this talk of a secret plan ＃ to develop a tricky policy, the emissions intensity scheme in the electricity sector, which [the authority] would recommend in a report and this would be used by Malcolm Turnbull to justify what he wanted to do.§This, Hamilton says, was touted by some members of the authority as a tool for Turnbull to use against a backbench reluctant to do anything on climate change. Hamilton was told to ※pull his head in§ and get in line with the plan that he was told represented the best chance of progress. He was initially ※half persuaded§ by the idea but as time wore on, he says he realised the ※secret plan§ wasn＊t plausible and that Turnbull was drifting further away from any meaningful action on climate change. In late 2016, the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said an emissions intensity scheme, or something like it, could be part of a government review into climate policy. That position lasted only a few hours before  and Turnbull dismissed the idea. ※Pathetic,§ says Hamilton.In August 2016, the cracks in the authority went on public display. The CCA had published a report recommending cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in line with the government＊s current target 每 a reduction of 26% to 28% by 2030. The CCA had previously recommended that target should be at least 40%. Hamilton and his CCA colleague Professor David Karoly, a climate scientist, . So now the professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University is out of the authority and readying himself to launch a third book in a climate change trilogy, .He thinks readers will feel ※reflective＃ but you won＊t feel hopeful.§ He says: ※If you look at what the scientists are saying and you＊re not despairing then you are not really listening to what they are saying.§"

However, I did have one extraordinary sighting: on the evening of the new moon, a male and female peregrine spearing in tandem towards the southern horizon. Both closed their wings into a long stoop and they fell across the sky until I could see them only as two unequal-sized drops of mercury, pulled by gravity into an ellipse.Best of all are the churning masses that the peregrines leave in their wake.  boil up from the pools in fractal patterns and the white lines across the males＊ wings flash and re-flash in the grey waves of their panic.

"One of Africa＊s oldest and largest elephants has been killed by poachers in , according to a conservation group that protects a dwindling group of ※big tuskers§ estimated to be as few as 25.Richard Moller of the Tsavo Trust said Satao II, about 50 years old, was found dead on Monday and was believed to have been shot with a poisoned arrow. Two poachers believed to be responsible for the killing were apprehended not long after his carcass was spotted in routine aerial reconnaissance of the Tsavo national park.※Luckily, through the work we do with the Kenyan  Service, we were able to find the carcass before the poachers could recover the ivory,§ said Moller.The elephant, , was beloved by visitors to the park. Moller said about 15 tuskers, named for impressive tusks that nearly scrape the ground, remained in Kenya out of an estimated worldwide population of 25. ※They are icons, they are ambassadors for elephants,§ he said.Satao II＊s death comes two days after a KWS officer was killed during an anti-poaching incident in the park, the second to die in less than a month at the hands of poachers, according to the wildlife authority.The number of African elephants has fallen by about 111,000 to 415,000 over the past decade, according to the . The killing shows no sign of abating, with approximately 30,000 elephants slaughtered for their ivory every year, mainly to satisfy demand in the Asian market for products coveted as a traditional medicine or as status symbols.Moller said one of Satao II＊s tusks weighed 51.5kg and the other 50.5kg. ※I am pretty gutted really. This particular elephant was one that was very approachable, one of those easy old boys to find. Many are the others are much more difficult to see,§ Moller said. ※He has been through lots of droughts and probably other attempts at poaching.§The Tsavo covers about 16,000 sq miles (42,000 sq km) and is a major challenge for rangers to patrol.The Tsavo Trust helps monitor the elephants through aerial and ground reconnaissance, and works closely with KWS. Moller praised the ※swift action§ that led to the arrests."																																																			
"Sea ice around  has shrunk to the smallest annual extent on record after years of resisting a trend of manmade global warming, preliminary US satellite data has shown. Ice floating around the frozen continent usually melts to its smallest for the year towards the end of February, the southern hemisphere summer, before expanding again as the autumn chill sets in. This year, sea ice extent contracted to 883,015 sq miles (2.28m sq km) on 13 February, according to daily data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). That extent is a fraction smaller than a previous low of 884,173 sq miles recorded on 27 February 1997 in satellite records dating back to 1979. Mark Serreze, director of the NSIDC, said he would wait for a few days＊ more measurements to confirm the record low. ※But, unless something funny happens, we＊re looking at a record minimum in Antarctica,§ he told Reuters. ※Some people say it＊s already happened. We tend to be conservative by looking at five-day running averages.§In many recent years, the average extent of sea ice around Antarctica has tended to expand despite the overall trend of global warming, blamed on a build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from burning fossil fuels. People sceptical of mainstream findings by climate scientists have often pointed to Antarctic sea ice as evidence against global warming. Some climate scientists have linked the paradoxical expansion to shifts in winds and ocean currents. ※We＊ve always thought of the Antarctic as the sleeping elephant starting to stir,§ Serreze said. ※Well, maybe it＊s starting to stir now.§ World average temperatures climbed to a record high in 2016 for the third year in a row. Climate scientists say warming is causing more extreme days of heat, downpours and is nudging up global sea levels. At the other end of the planet,  in recent years.

"ust down the road from Gatwick, the neatly hedged English countryside gives way to an exuberant, utterly alien-looking landscape. Arable fields are obliterated by dense thickets of sallow. Eight metre-wide blackthorn hedges spill into flowery meadows. Wild pigs and red deer run rampant through ragwort, thistles and other weeds. The air is alive with birdsong rarely heard in Britain today 每 spectacular bursts of nightingale and the purring of turtle doves.In barely a decade, rewilded nature has conquered  in West Sussex. Rewilding appears to be conquering conservation too. As Brexit and the savaging of agricultural subsidies loom, farming may also be engulfed by this new wild. But as rewilding blossoms, so do controversies. Scientists recently warned that wild boar illegally released into Scotland  that is resistant to antibiotics.While many farmers denounce the folly of replacing food production with wilderness, some conservationists admit the term is divisive. Privately, senior National Trust staff say they can＊t mention the R-word even though they recently launched ambitious plans to  每 creating new meadows, hedges, marshes and woodlands.Last year the charity  and the author and  for purchasing a sheep farm on Borrowdale without the farmhouse, intending to reduce sheep grazing in this part of the Lake District.In Wales, one ecologist says the concept is alienating landowners and can＊t be mentioned to farmers. In Northumberland, attempts by the Lynx UK Trust to release the wild cats . Even the harmless, herbivorous beaver is the subject of fierce debate: while it was recognised as a native animal in Scotland last year,  roam free only on a government trial.※For us it is strange to see the British struggling with the beaver. Come on, we have thousands of them!§ Dutch ecologist Leo Linnartz told a rewilding conference at  last week. Knepp is an intensive 3,500-acre arable and dairy farm that has been dramatically rewilded by its owner, Charlie Burrell. Linnartz says that many Dutch people objected to ※nature development§ 30 years ago but rewilding principles are now mainstream. ※We have wolves coming into the Netherlands again and we are much, much smaller than Britain. If the Dutch can do it, everybody can do it.§In Britain, the movement ignited by writer and environmental activist  is popularly seen to seek the return of extinct carnivores 每 bears, wolves and lynx. In practice, this large-scale restoration of wildlife is returning more modest herbivores to the countryside. Since 2001 at Knepp, Burrell has set free wild herbivores 每 konik ponies, longhorn cattle, red deer and Tamworth pigs 每 to mimic the grazing of extinct aurochs, wild boar and wild horses.Nature has bounced back astonishingly quickly. Barren monocultures of maize have been replaced with a landscape that looks more like African savannah. The Knepp Castle estate boasts  than anywhere in Britain. It＊s thought to be the only place in the country where Britain＊s fastest-declining bird, the turtle dove, is increasing in number, with at least 16 pairs this summer. It＊s a hotspot for endangered nightingales. The air is thick with birds of prey 每 elusive long-eared owls, hobbies and one of the country＊s only tree-nesting peregrine falcons.A few rewilding purists scoff at reintroducing herbivorous free-roaming livestock but ecologists say that rewilding＊s key principle is to replace conservation ※mollycoddling§ with ※restoring natural processes§ 每 allowing a landscape and its plants and animals to run wild. For decades, ecologists believed the end result would be dense forest 每 and a mass extinction of sun-loving wild flowers and butterflies 每 but this dogma has been demolished by Dutch ecologist . Since the 1980s Vera has introduced wild cattle, horses and red deer to 4,000 hectares of rewilded marshland at  nature reserve, and proven that ※natural§ grazing creates a more dynamic landscape, a constantly changing mosaic of open glades and wooded groves.In the Highlands,  as large landowners such as the Danish owner of  and Paul Lister at  restore ancient Caledonian pine forest by culling the historically unprecedentedly high numbers of red deer. But David Balharry, former Scotland director of , cautions that rewilding in Scotland will only be championed by policymakers and politicians when it is led by local communities.For Burrell at Knepp, rewilding has been a pragmatic way to revive the struggling family farm. Ecotourism makes as much profit as his conventional farming business once did. And with Brexit looming, Burrell＊s diversified business is no longer dependent on the disappearing EU subsidy regime.Knepp＊s unproductive heavy clay meant Burrell could not compete with globalised food production. The government＊s inevitable post-Brexit slashing of farm subsidies could make hundreds of similarly ※marginal§ farms unprofitable. Burrell＊s profits may be steady while conventional dairy and cattle farm incomes fall off a cliff but no farmers have yet followed his example.※It takes a new eye to look at this and say, ＆that＊s beautiful＊, rather than go, ＆that＊s just a real mess＊,§ says Burrell. ※Other farmers may have a moral attitude towards it too 每 why are you stopping food production?§ Burrell produces 75 tonnes of organic free-range meat each year but many farmers criticise rewilding for abandoning productive farmland when the world＊s population is growing., rewilding director of Rewilding Europe, sees no conflict between food production and rewilding: Europe is heading for a future of food produced more intensively in fewer areas, releasing less productive arable land for rewilding, he says. ※Farming is being done by fewer and fewer farmers on a larger scale on the best soils. They leave the less profitable lands 每 the Scottish Highlands or continental marshlands and river deltas become adventure land for an increasingly urban population.§Helmer says there is no point in seeking to feed the world with traditional organic farming because there is no one to do the labour: when he asks Dutch students who wants to farm, none raise their hands. ※They have a completely different relationship to nature to their parents or grandparents. They are not fighting with it on a daily basis. On one hand they are disconnected from nature but on the other hand they are becoming more relaxed with nature 每 it＊s hunting and gathering but hunting with a camera and gathering experiences. Corporate training or meetings are held outside. The part of the countryside which is not used for intensive farming starts to serve all these new urban needs.§At the Knepp conference, ecology professors reported that students were newly inspired by rewilding but some environmentalists worry how it connects with urban populations. ※The challenge is how to make rewilding an issue that people in their ordinary lives can take action on,§ says Elaine Gilligan of Friends of the Earth. ※It has a real wow factor for engaging people in nature but how can rewilding be taken to the streets of Birmingham?§Rewilders argue that reducing flood risks for cities is one practical way rewilding can enhance urban life. The  is restoring 30,000 hectares of upland bogs which act as giant sponges for floodwater. Conservationists are also working with Leeds city council on proposals to rewild the upper river Aire 每 adding meanders, planting trees and creating new washlands 每 to reduce the floodwater flows through Leeds.As well as reducing flood risk, rewilding alleviates soil erosion, says Ted Green, founder president of the . Intensive farming can worsen flash flooding, and cause fertile soils to be swept out to sea. ※The land may belong to the landowner but the soil must belong to the nation,§ says Green. ※We are fertilising the ocean. When you see people cleaning out their houses after floods, you don＊t see them removing water, you see them removing mud. If we used the word ＆mud＊ instead of floodwater, it＊s no longer an engineering problem 每 it＊s a farming problem.§As conventional conservation jumps on the rewilding bandwagon, Miles King, founder of the charity , fears it could become a cliche. A project to release water voles into Northumberland was recently described as rewilding. ※That＊s just a basic conservation project,§ says King. ※The risk is you end up rebadging all these conventional nature conservation activities as rewilding in the hope that people take an interest. We need to avoid being sucked into that.§And some conservationists worry that rewilding could replace the traditional protection of rare species on small nature reserves. ※If rewilding really takes off there＊s a risk people will say, ＆Oh we don＊t have to do any of that old stuff,＊§ says Matt Shardlow, . ※But we still have habitat fragmentation and species in tiny places and we have to take care of them even if you have some areas made bigger for wildlife.※If in 100 years time you have a Knepp in every parish, maybe some species can come off the endangered lists and won＊t need such precious care.§As turtle doves purred in the burgeoning thickets at Knepp, the conservationist Sir John Lawton, the author of the influential government report, , led a rallying cry for ※more, bigger, better and joined§ wild areas. ※We need more Knepps and Ennerdales. If we can do impressive mid-range rewilding somewhere as close to Gatwick airport as this, we can do it anywhere. This is the south-east of England for crying out loud! Let＊s not pretend we can＊t make space for nature because we can and we must.§Purists wouldn＊t call it rewilding but some councils are relaxing their management of verges and parks, letting grass grow longer and allowing wild flower areas to develop. Burnley borough council estimates it is saving ?58,000 a year by reducing grass-cutting to benefit wildlife. Councils including Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, East Sussex and Bristol have adopted ※pollinator action plans§ with strategies for wilder areas to encourage bees and butterflies. Friends of the Earth for on pollinators.Gardeners are unlikely to be able to reintroduce wild boar (rewilders say you need a minimum of 120 hectares to create a large enough area for wild grazing) but we can at least liberate our lawns. Instead of unleashing wild ponies, sow yellow rattle, a flower that is a parasite of grass and creates space for wild flowers and herbs. Long grass is the food plant for butterfly caterpillars including meadow browns, ringlets and marbled whites, and home for grasshoppers and meadow ants that attract green woodpeckers.Many rewilded Dutch reserves are coastal and riverine areas close to cities and towns and some of the most exciting rewilding in Britain is happening on the Thames estuary.

"Never before have we lived in such an urban world. Asphalt and concrete extend themselves over the earth, water disappears undergroundand steel and glass sparkle under the sun. Urban expansion is one of the chief characteristics of the freshly minted . Yet hunters still leave the fringes of Mexico City to stalk game among the dormant volcanoes inside its southern limit. People are killed by leopards in the informal slums invading Sanjay Gandhi National Park within the megacity of Mumbai. Woodpeckers hammer the trees of Sao Paulo＊s Ibirapuera urban park; badgers raise their young in hidden locations in London; and penguins walk the beaches of Cape Town. Diminishing ecosystems are somehow hold together under the pressure of urbanisation.Humans have always been attracted to sites with a great natural variety of plants and animals. The most biodiverse cities encompass several biomes, combining ocean and dry land habitats, lakes and mountains, or forests and savannahs. But to calculate which city is the world＊s most biodiverse is complicated. Not all cities have the same area within their administrative limits, or the data necessary.Two of the world＊s largest megacities, Sao Paulo and Mexico City, are surprising candidates for the title. Sao Paulo perches between Brazil＊s great Atlantic rainforest and the tropical savannah of the Cerrado 每 two highly rich biomes 每 allowing the megacity to surpass even the Amazon river port of Manaus in biodiversity, according to conservationist Denise Rambaldi. ※One lesson from the reintroduction of the Golden Lion Tamarin monkey in the Mata Atlantica is that it is much cheaper to preserve species in a particular area than to reintroduce them,§ she says.Mexico City, meanwhile, was founded on lakebeds where the deserts of the northern highlands encountered the wooded volcanoes of Mexico＊s neo-volcanic axis. Even now, it still contains  within its city limits.Singapore, in the  每 a term used for regions where great biodiversity is threatened by destruction 每is another interesting contender. Extending through Malaysia to Borneo and Bali, this high-density city, with its , has made greening and biophilia an integral part of urban planning.By law, in certain areas, developers are responsible for replacing the greenery they occupy for construction. The result is a city of rooftop gardens, interconnected parks and a  allowing citizens to record sightings of plants and animals. Amazingly, Singapore has managed to increase both its population and its green spaces at the same time. Since its independence, the citystate sought to distinguish itself by being clean and green, and today it has a , despite its high density. By way of comparison, Greater London has an average ; Los Angeles was recorded as having 13% in 2015 after a dramatic decline from .Several other biodiverse cities 每 Medellin in Colombia, Iquitos in Peru, Brunei, Kunming in China, and Mumbai 每 are contenders for a position in the top five.In the index proposed by the , biodiversity itself is not the only indicator to consider.Some cities such as Singapore, as well as Curitiba, Barcelona and Melbourne, are notable precisely for their leadership in recognising and exploiting biodiversity as a policy-making tool and an integral part of urban wellbeing.Indeed, a study from Denmark shows that people living more than one kilometre from a of experiencing stress than people living within 300 meters. Increased stress impacts mental health, increases risks of heart attacks and diabetes 每 so it is not surprising that access to parks has been shown to increase home values from 5% to 7%.The world＊s most biodiverse countries 每 Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, China, Mexico, Peru, Australia, India, Ecuador and Venezuela 每 are tropical or semi-tropical, and rapidly urbanising. Nature can seem a lesser priority here, trumped by water supply, paving, housing, education, health and other issues. But Singapore, for example, has shown that biodiversity can be part of the solution to many of these problems; it can be an integral part of urban infrastructure which prevents flooding, mitigates extreme temperatures and filters pollution, as well as promoting tourism and better health.The world＊s most biodiverse urban area, in raw numbers and with an understanding for its value, could be Cape Town, according to Thomas Elmqvist, editor of  and leader of the United Nation＊s City and Biodiversity Outlook Project. The Western Cape, where Cape Town is located, contains  in South Africa. Baboons, ostriches and zebras, live in Table Mountain National Park, while whales, seals and otters swim off its shores. The stability of Cape Town＊s climate on the southern tip of Africa has enabled it to become home to approximately , 361 species of birds and 83 species of mammals. It is a sad reality that this biodiversity is under threat: as its human population has increased by more than 30% since 2011, 318 types of plants, 22 types of birds and 24 types of animals are in danger of extinction. But Cape Town is taking a variety of measures to protect and preserve this incredible natural asset.One species endemic to South Africa, however, is not likely to be at risk any time soon, adorning balconies throughout the world as it does. Next time you see a geranium in bloom, think of the world＊s most biodiverse city, fighting against the tide. "																																																			
"hen Theresa May fires the Brexit starting gun by triggering article 50, she will start a process that could dramatically reshape almost every aspect of British life 每 from our economy, laws, and place in the world to our natural environment. The difficult choices our politicians make in just a few years could change the face of Britain for generations to come.Even before the tough bargaining with the EU and other countries start in earnest, another, more domestic negotiation process will get underway 每 the constitutional power struggle between parliament and government over who will have the final say on the momentous Brexit decisions. A lot will ride on the outcome of this tug of war, and that includes the fate of many vital environmental safeguards we take for granted. Over four decades of EU membership, Britain has acquired one of the most formidable bodies of environmental law in the world. Whether it＊s air pollution, water quality, or toxic chemicals, many of the environmental safeguards protecting our health and our environment are rooted in EU law. It is EU law that has chivvied a recalcitrant government into , improving , and banning . The habitats and birds directives have provided stronger protection for threatened wildlife than any UK law. And it is the EU air quality laws that have allowed campaigners to hold ministers to account for their failure to in the courts. All these vital protections 每 the fruits of decades of negotiations, campaigning, and political work 每 are about to come under an . Along with thousands of other EU laws, ministers say that most environmental legislation will be transposed en bloc into domestic law by the ※§. Although this might sound like an unalloyed piece of good news, it isn＊t.Ministers have  that only two-thirds of environmental regulations can be adopted as they are, leaving the remaining third in dangerous limbo. But even the laws that are directly transferred will be put on much shakier ground. The institutions that guarantee their enforcement, such as the European court of justice and the commission, will have no jurisdiction in Britain. So who will hold the government to account? have suggested Theresa May favours the option of the UK remaining a member of EU regulatory agencies, but what powers these watchdogs will retain and what laws they will be able to enforce is not clear.An even greater and more immediate danger lurks in the great repeal bill. Ministers have been talking about including a so-called  in the bill that would give them the power to change primary legislation without a vote in parliament. In this scenario, an all-powerful executive will be able to cherry-pick which environmental legislation they want to keep while ditching the rest with a stroke of the pen. The vital laws protecting our health and our environment from air pollution, noxious chemicals, and destructive industries will be left hostage to the whims of the government and business lobbies of the day. Clues to how these powers may be used already abound. Michael Gove has for the habitat directive to be scrapped. The environment minister George Eustice is on record describing it as ※. And a leading Brexiter like Jacob Rees-Mogg has Britain could slash environmental and safety regulations on imported products, adopting, for example, emissions standards that are ※good enough for India§. Industry lobbies on both sides of the Atlantic have already sniffed an opportunity to do away with regulations that put consumers before corporate profits. A  recently told Radio 4＊s Today programme that any US-UK trade deal would be dependent on Britain allowing imports of US foods that have so far been banned, from chlorine-washed chicken to hormone-infused beef. Leading car makers in the US have already lobbied Trump for  standards and got what they wanted.

Since any deployment of wind and solar energy by communities and individual households is a threat to the big six＊s stranglehold, Centrica is exploiting Brexit to pull a fast one on the competition and, ultimately, on consumers too.This is just the beginning. The deeper we wade into the quagmire of Brexit negotiations, the more pressure industry lobbies are going to put on our politicians to sacrifice crucial environmental safeguards on the altar of low-standard trade deals. This is why our elected representatives have a crucial role to play in defending the values Britain holds dear.A majority of people have voted for Brexit, but they didn＊t vote for a more polluted or less green Britain. This government has no mandate to tamper with the environmental safeguards protecting our parks, our beaches, and our air. If the vague promise about ※taking back control§ is to be at least partially fulfilled, the crucial decisions about the future of our environment cannot be made over a handshake between ministers and corporate lobbyists. Any changes to this vital legislation must be done in a democratic way 每 through a parliamentary vote and the thorough public scrutiny that accompanies it. A truly sovereign parliament during Brexit will be the last line of defence for our green and pleasant land."																																																			
" boasts a great many superlatives: it is the driest continent, the coldest, the remotest, the windiest and the highest on average. Right now, during midwinter, it is also the darkest. As a rift on the continent＊s Larsen C ice shelf lengthens and gets closer to the ice front, we are anticipating the detachment of a large tabular iceberg within the next few weeks.This comes after observations of a  on another ice shelf last summer, reports of  on several ice shelves and, in a report last week, indications of a , which included rainfall as far as 82∼ south, during the 2015-16 El Ni?o. Are glaciologists shocked by any of this? Is Antarctica going to melt away? Is ?The answer to these questions is no. Glaciologists are not alarmed about most of these processes; they are examples of Antarctica simply doing what we know Antarctica has done for thousands of years. But because there is a potential link between the ice sheet and climate change, glaciologists are suddenly faced with a situation where the spotlight is on our science on a seemingly daily basis, and every time a crack grows, or a meltstream forms, it becomes news. The situation is a conundrum: we want people to be aware of Antarctica and concerned about what might happen there in the near future as climate changes. But hyping research results to sound like climate change, when they are just improved understanding of natural behaviour, is misleading.To understand all of this, we need to think about how Antarctica works. The ice sheet stores 90% of Earth＊s freshwater, which would translate to about 60m of sea-level rise around the globe if it all melted. If Larsen C were to disappear, its tributaries could contribute about 1cm to the global sea level. The ice gets there through snowfall, just like the ski slopes at Chamonix, but, in Antarctica, with annual average temperatures ranging from -5C to -60C, most of the snow that falls over winter remains at the end of each summer. Over millions of years, snowfall has been added, buried and compacted by new snowfall, and an ice sheet has grown.Once the ice is thick enough, it flows downhill towards the ocean, where it lifts off the ground and floats, forming an ice shelf. In contact with the ocean below and the atmosphere above, this is where the ※rubber hits the road§: to maintain its size, the ice sheet must shed the extra ice it gains through snowfall, which it does through two processes that both occur at the ice shelves 每 calving of icebergs at the front, and melting underneath. Ice shelves also hold back the flow of the grounded ice; if shedding from ice shelves exceeds the gains from snowfall, they will shrink, and then glaciers feeding them will feel less resistance to flow and speed up, and sea level will rise.There is plenty going on that merits concern: Antarctic ice shelves overall are seeing , and the ice sheet is losing mass in key sectors of Antarctica. Continuing losses might soon lead to an . However, we do not need to press the panic button for Larsen C. Large calving events such as this are normal processes of a healthy ice sheet, ones that have occurred for decades, centuries, millennia 每 on cycles that are much longer than a human or satellite lifetime. The Larsen C rift is like  observed in Antarctica before. What looks like an enormous loss is just ordinary housekeeping for this part of Antarctica. An iceberg, even one as large as Delaware or a quarter of the size of Wales, is small compared to the whole ice sheet, which averages 1.4 miles thick and is larger in area than Australia. Think of it as one grain in a bag of rice. Similarly, waterfalls off the front of the ice shelf are not a catastrophe. Surface melt is common and occurs every summer as temperatures rise above 0C, as reported in .So, while ice fracturing and surface melting may sound like signs of climate change in action in Antarctica, they are really part of the background against which we must look for real change. Real changes are happening there, and when we report them they need to stand out.  involved large amounts of surface melt that forms ponds on an ice shelf that had already weakened. We have not observed this on Larsen C. We will continue to monitor Antarctica by satellites and from the ground, but we will not cry wolf about an imminent collapse of Larsen C."																																																			
"The government has announced its withdrawal from an arrangement that allows other countries to fish in British waters. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, claimed the UK was ※taking back control§.On Monday ministers will trigger withdrawal from the London fisheries convention, signed in 1964 before the UK joined the , to start the two-year process to leave the agreement. The convention allows vessels from the UK, France, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands to fish within six and 12 nautical miles of each other＊s coastlines.※We will be saying we＊re taking back control,§ Gove said on the BBC＊s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. ※We will have control. We can decide the terms of access.§Gove said leaving the European Union would involve exiting the EU common fisheries policy, which allows all European countries access between 12 and 200 nautical miles off the UK and sets quotas for how much fish nations can catch. ※When we leave the European Union we will become an independent political state and that means that we can then extend control of our waters up to 200 miles or the median line between Britain and France, and Britain and Ireland,§ he said.※One critical thing about the common fisheries policy is that it has been an environmental disaster. And one of the reasons we want to change it is that we want to ensure that we can have sustainable fish stocks for the future ＃ I think it＊s important that we recognise that leaving the European Union is going to help the environment.§According to 2015 figures, the UK fishing industry is made up of more than 6,000 vessels, landing 708,000 tonnes of fish worth ?775m. About 10,000 tonnes of fish were caught by other countries under the London convention, worth an estimated ?17m.  Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen＊s Organisations, welcomed the government＊s decision, saying it was ※an important part of establishing the UK as an independent coastal state with sovereignty over its own exclusive economic zone§.Ben Stafford, head of campaigns at , said achieving sustainable fishing was about ※much more than which country fishes where§. He said: ※It is about ensuring that fishermen use the right fishing gear, that fishing takes place at levels that maintain sustainable stocks and that we pioneer ways to monitor what is happening at sea in order to understand the impacts of fishing.※Leaving the EU means we could get these things right, but we will still need to cooperate with our neighbours, as fish do not recognise lines on a map.§  Will McCallum, ＊s head of oceans, said: ※For years, successive UK governments have blamed Brussels for their own failure to support the small-scale, sustainable fishers who are the backbone of our fishing fleet.  ※If Brexit is to herald a better future for our fishers, the new environment secretary, Michael Gove, must keep the 2015 Conservative party manifesto commitment to rebalance fishing quotas in favour of ＆small-scale, specific locally-based fishing communities＊.§ Tom West, a consultant at the environmental law firm ClientEarth, described the move as a negotiating tactic. ※As a country outside the EU, we need to consider how we can best cooperate with our neighbours rather than unilaterally withdrawing from all agreements in the hope that standing alone will make us better,§ he said. ※Many fish stocks in UK waters are shared with our neighbours and so need cooperation and shared management.§ "																																																			
"The fight against global warming is one of humanity＊s great moral movements, alongside the abolition of slavery, the defeat of apartheid, votes for women and gay rights, according to the former US vice-president and climate campaigner, .The battle to halt climate change can be won, he said, because the green revolution delivering clean energy is both bigger than the industrial revolution and happening faster than the digital revolution.Gore has played a major global role in raising awareness of the dangers of climate change since his 2007 film  and made his comments, among his most outspoken to date, in a recent speech in London.※The climate movement should be seen in the context of the great moral causes that have transformed and improved the outlook for humanity,§ he told the . ※It was wrong to allow slavery to continue, it was wrong to deny women the right to vote, it was wrong to discriminate on the basis of skin colour or who you fell in love with.※When the central issue was thus framed in stark relief because of who we are as human beings, the outcome became foreordained,§ Gore said. ※We chose what was right, and now in this case it is clearly wrong to destroy the prospects of living prosperously and sustainably on a clean earth when we bequeath it to our children. It is wrong to use the sky as an open sewer, it is wrong to condemn future generations to a lifetime haunted by continual declines in their standard of living, and give them a world of political disruption and all the chaos that the scientists have warned us about.§Gore acknowledged there was opposition to strong action on climate change, but cited the US civil rights movement as an inspiration: ※During some of the bleakest days of the civil rights movement, Dr Martin Luther King Junior was asked by one of his fellow advocates how long is this going to take and he famously answered, not long because no lie can live for ever.§Gore, whose new film  is released this summer, said while the moral argument meant humanity would confront climate change, the rapid growth of the low-carbon economy meant it could be successful.※There is now in our world a sustainability revolution and it＊s best understood, in my view, by placing it in the context of other great global transformations 每 the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, the digital revolution,§ he said. ※This sustainability revolution has the breadth and magnitude of the industrial revolution but it has the speed of the digital revolution.※Instead of beginning in a corner of the UK in a world of 1.5bn people, and then slowly spreading to western Europe and North America, this sustainability revolution is being jump started in rich and poor countries alike in every corner of this world of 7.4 billion people,§ he said, likening it to the rapid spread of mobile phones around the world.Gore is not the first climate campaigner to make a moral argument for acting on global warming. In 2014, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of the most revered figures of South Africa＊s anti-apartheid struggle, . ※During the anti-apartheid struggle, using boycotts, divestment and sanctions, we were not only able to apply economic pressure on the unjust state, but also serious moral pressure. People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change,§ he wrote in the Guardian.Gore told his London audience he was optimistic of success, despite the recent US withdrawal from the global Paris climate accord: ※No one person can stop the climate movement or the sustainability revolution 每 we are going to win no matter what President  tries to do.§"																																																			
"It is not what you would expect to hear in the Conservative suburban heartlands of Beckenham, Bromley and Boreham Wood in south-east England 每 homeowners voicing their approval for a wave of immigrants from Asia.As one of the senior researchers studying the flocks of Afro-Asians said: ※Many people say they bring an enormous sense of wellbeing. They say they are charismatic, beautiful, exotic. They absolutely love having them around.§These immigrants are not human. They are , members of the parrot family better known as ring-necked or rose-ringed parakeets.Their flashing green plumage and shrill squawks have long been part of daily life around the parks, golf courses, university campuses and garden feeding tables of south and west London.Now they have spread way beyond the M25 and M2 that once marked the extent of their presence in Britain. But if government scientists act on advice they are about to be given by parrot experts, that spread could be halted by the culling of flocks that settle in new sites.The parakeets are a potential threat to crops and native birds. A four-year European research programme called ParrotNet is about to present its findings to scientists at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, one of whom has the perfect name for the job 每 Dave Parrott. The co-founder of ParrotNet, Hazel Jackson, said the parakeets were ※an urgent economic, societal and environmental problem§.The squawkers are now making a noise in Milton Keynes, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool and the Edinburgh-Dundee area. In Europe, parakeets have settled in more than 100 cities, and are found as far north as Estonia and Sweden. They are said to be ※out of control§ in Brussels, have taken hold in Paris and Amsterdam, and in Spain another species, the monk parakeet or , is causing problems in Barcelona, Madrid and Seville.Monk, or Quaker, parakeets, which originate from South America, have settled in Britain too, in Boreham Wood and the Isle of Dogs, but have never numbered more than 100 and are  after a state-approved cull.Scientists estimate the European parrot population at ※a minimum of 85,000§ but because they are spreading and breeding so quickly there could be many more than that figure, and there will certainly be in the future. There were an estimated 32,000 ring-necked parakeets in Britain at the last count in 2012.※There is a potential for parakeets to cause a lot of economic damage, especially to fruit farms and vineyards,§ said Jackson, who works at the University of Kent. ※There have been problems around the Mediterranean and especially in Israel, where crops have been decimated by parakeets. The birds threaten local biodiversity as they chase away native birds from food sites, and exclude endemic birds and bats from nesting cavities. But people love them. Public perception is a big challenge.§Sarah Crowley, another ParrotNet expert based at the University of Exeter, has just published a paper that could help to shape government policy. She suggests that decision-makers should ※try to address people＊s concerns before initiating control projects§ and give people a say in the policy-making process.The worst damage by non-native parakeets has been in Israel, where Yoav Motro, head of the Israel ministry of agriculture＊s plant protection service, said: ※We have had parakeet problems for decades now, and unfortunately when it comes to numbers and damage, Israel is well ahead of Europe.§ Hundreds of parakeets will descend on fields of almonds, sunflowers, pecans and other crops. Losses were hard to quantify, Motro said, but with farmers operating on a 10% profit margin they could lose all their profit to parakeet damage.Between 1984 and 2007 nearly 150,000 parakeets were imported as pets into Europe. The release of many ring-necked parakeets from captivity, and their ability to thrive in urban areas and cope with low temperatures 每 they originate from the Himalayas region 每 has led to their rapid rise in numbers.※All the populations across Europe have seen the same pattern of exponential growth,§ said Jackson. ※Populations can double in size within a few years.§The findings of 25 to 30 core scientists on the ParrotNet project, backed by EU scientific research funding, will be revealed at a conference in September. Before then, policy advice will be sent to Britain＊s , a state agency that will report to Defra. Jackson said ParrotNet＊s recommendations would be:← Stricter legislation on the possession, transportation and commercial trafficking of invasive parakeets, which has already happened in Spain.← A new system for relinquishing unwanted pet parakeets.← Removal of legal and financial constraints on rapid-response eradication of new populations, especially in areas where they are currently not present.← Raising public awareness of the parakeet population and potential problems.Leaving parakeets free to move and breed is an option favoured by the ecologist Chris D Thomas, however. The University of York professor argues against ※irrational persecution§ of non-native species in a new book, , to be published this week.Thomas, who does not agree with the accepted wisdom that humans have irrevocably damaged the natural world, said: ※We do not try to control species because they moved in the past, so why should we now try to police the distributions of species that are thriving in the human epoch? It makes no sense.§Rats, rabbits and hares were ※invasive§ species to Britain at one time. In the United States, eight pairs of sparrows in 1850 have now become 150 million birds, with no known ill effects on the environment or the economy.※If parakeets cause a specific problem in a specific location, we may need to control them, or preferably discourage them,§ said Thomas.※Defra should only control them in specific locations, not generally, if there is clear and evident commercial harm, and not because of some misplaced distrust of ＆foreign＊ species. Judge a species by its impacts, not by its origins.§Parrot factsRing-necked parakeets from the Himalayas region and Africa; monk parakeets from South America.In the UK, there are several theories about ring-necked parakeets being released during the filming of  in Shepperton in 1951, or by Jimi Hendrix when he let a pair go free in London in the 1960s. Others say the 1987 storms damaged so many aviaries that many parakeets escaped. A pair were first recorded as having bred in the wild in 1855, and sightings have been steadily growing since the 1930s. Nearly 150,000 were imported into Europe as pets between 1984 and 2007, with many people releasing them from captivity.Probably 100,000 or more throughout Europe. The latest official figure is ※a minimum of 85,000§ in Europe, but no detailed recent count has been made. The UK estimate was 32,000 in 2012.They like fruit, nuts and seeds but are wasteful eaters, pecking at part of an apple, then moving on to the next one.They nest in holes in trees, and thrive in areas of parkland, close to urban homes. Ring-necked parakeet hotspots are Ramsgate, inside the M25, central London parks, Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris. Monk parakeets thrive in Barcelona, Madrid and Seville."																																																			
																																																			
"hanks to this government＊s intransigence about tackling air pollution, the battle to improve the quality of the air we breathe has played out not in the political arena, but in the courts. Time after time, the government has found itself on the wrong side of the law: first for its failure to meet legally binding European targets on harmful nitrogen dioxide?emissions; then, for failing to produce an adequate plan to address these.?Its latest delaying tactic has been to claim it could not meet this week＊s court-imposed deadline for publishing a new draft plan, because of the ※purdah§ convention ruling out new government announcements in the run-up to an election.And so it has fallen to judges yet again to take the government to task over its failure to act. Today＊s ruling took apart the government＊s case: its own purdah guidance sets out  where public health is at risk. As the judge pointed out, why would it be better to have parties debating what ought to be in a draft air pollution plan, when it could be debating what is actually in it?The government＊s real motivations are political, not procedural. Having delayed taking meaningful action for seven years, it is clearly nervous about proposing any measures that hit drivers of diesel cars during?an election campaign. Its political cowardice is astounding 每 and pointless. Public attitudes have shifted in recent years, and London＊s Labour mayor, , has made tackling air pollution one of his top priorities. The government is unlikely to face opposition to tougher action from any of its mainstream political opponents, and is enjoying double-digit poll leads.Yet it continues to shirk its responsibilities to the nation＊s public health. Today＊s air pollution may be less visible than the smogs that settled over our cities in the 1950s, but it is a deadly killer, responsible for upwards of 40,000 premature deaths per year. London breached its annual air pollution limit just , and legal limits?were easily surpassed in the . The effects are particularly pernicious for children whose lungs are still developing.The human cost makes the government＊s latest attempts to delay a disgrace. The two-month extension it was seeking for its final plan could have meant thousands of avoidable premature deaths, all in service of not wanting to jeopardise a marginal number of votes in an election that it is on course to win handsomely. It＊s a sick calculus.The good news is that air pollution is easier to tackle than other environmental and public health challenges. Unlike climate change, it is relatively localised: city-scale actions to address pollution levels can have a marked effect on their air quality. Much (though by no means all) of the problem comes down to emissions from diesel vehicles and, to a greater extent than in other areas of public health, consumers are highly responsive to financial incentives. The irony is that we know this because many have switched from petrol to diesel as a result of sweeteners introduced back when diesel was thought to be more environmentally friendly due to its lower carbon emissions.But heavy lobbying from the car industry in Westminster and Brussels has staved off firm action. European emissions tests for diesel cars have been far easier to manipulate than in the US; as a result, 97% of modern diesel cars . Behind the scenes, the British government has tried to . It＊s a familiar story: the government similarly watered down plans to tackle childhood obesity in the face of special pleading from the food and drink industry.The high court ruling puts the ball back in the government＊s court. It should choose to accept it, rather than appeal. But either way, it has been exposed as a government willing to privilege marginal political advantage and?the lobbying efforts of big business over the health of the nation."

The Forestry Commission had laid lime-rich hard standing down the centre of the main ride, presumably in preparation for conifer felling later in the year. The raw substrate was providing the equivalent of a sheep＊s salt lick and so, on a stiflingly hot day, butterflies were descending from on high for a mineral lolly.I had never seen these butterflies up close before. Even smaller than I had imagined, they held their folded wings unusually high so that they appeared like tiny sharks＊ fins protruding from a sea of rubble. They were extraordinarily mobile too, in a stop-start way, scuttling quickly on crooked legs, like crabs, between lime fixes. The thin, pure-white, line after which they were named, traced out on indeterminate grey-brown wings, was vivid. A yet more stunning detail was an exquisite, luminous, orange frill close to the wing edges. In all this subtle beauty it felt, at that moment, as if heaven had come down to earth."																																																			
"Countries with responsibility over world heritage-listed coral reefs should adopt ambitious climate change targets, aiming to cut greenhouse gas emissions to levels that would keep global temperature increases to just 1.5C, the UN agency responsible for overseeing world heritage sites has said.At a meeting of Unesco＊s world heritage committee in Krak車w, , a decision was adopted that clarified and strengthened the responsibility of countries that have custodianship over world-heritage listed coral reefs.Until now, most countries have interpreted their responsibility over such reefs as implying they need to protect them from local threats such as water pollution and overfishing.But between 2014 and 2017, reefs in every major reef region bleached, with much of the coral dying, in the . Over those three years, 21 of the 29 listed sites suffered severe or repeated heat stress.Last month  of climate change＊s impacts on world heritage-listed reefs and it concluded that local efforts were ※no longer sufficient§ 每 concluding the only hope was to keep global temperature increases below 1.5C.The new decision builds on that assessment, clarifying the responsibility of countries with custodianship over world-heritage listed coral reefs.The decision adopted by the world heritage committee said it ※reiterates the importance of state parties undertaking the most ambitious implementation of the Paris agreement§, which it noted meant pursuing efforts to limit global average temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.It went on that it ※strongly invites all state parties ＃ to undertake actions to address climate change under the Paris agreement that are fully consistent with their obligations within the world heritage convention to protect the [outstanding universal values] of all world heritage properties§.The decision appeared to implement the earlier finding that local efforts were insufficient to protect reefs, and indicated the committee considered that countries were obliged under the world heritage convention to undertake strong action on climate change.The decision put most countries＊ emissions targets in stark contrast with what was needed to protect their reefs. Combined, all countries＊ commitments made so far .But some countries with coral reefs are not contributing their fair share to even that level of ambition. Australia, which has responsibility over the world＊s largest coral reef system 每 the Great Barrier Reef 每 has climate change targets consistent with between 3C and 4C of warming by 2100, .Moreover, Australia doesn＊t have any policies in place that will help it achieve those targets, with  showing emissions are not expected to be cut at all, and instead will rise for at least decades to come.The first indication that Unesco would consider action on climate change an obligation of custodians of world-heritage listed coral reefs came in June when it , following back-to-back mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017 that killed as much as half its coral.Despite acknowledging Australia＊s progress in addressing water quality on the reef, and deciding not to put the reef on its ※in-danger§ list, Unesco noted that , and said there was the need to consider how bleaching was affecting the effectiveness of the country＊s plan to protect it.※Last week the Australian government bragged that the  was not put on the in-danger list at this meeting,§ said Imogen Zethoven from the Australian Marine Conservation Society, who was at the world heritage committee meeting in Poland.※However, this week the Australian government should be worried. It knows very well that it is still on probation with the world heritage committee. This decision means Australia needs to rapidly reduce carbon pollution and reject new coalmines 每 otherwise our reef is at great risk of being placed on the world heritage in-danger list in 2020.※The Australian government must now, more than ever, rule out any new coalmines and urgently develop a climate policy that will protect our global icon. It must do its fair share of the global effort to reduce pollution.※If it doesn＊t, the world heritage committee should hold Australia to account for failing to tackle the single greatest threat to our Great Barrier Reef 每 and for putting all other world heritage coral reefs at risk.§An Earthjustice attorney, Noni Austin, who also attended the world heritage committee meeting, said: ※The world heritage committee＊s decision has confirmed what scientists have been saying for years: urgent and rapid action to reduce global warming and implement the Paris agreement is essential for the survival of coral reefs into the future.§"																																																			
"The government has been ordered to publish tough new plans to tackle air pollution after the high court rejected attempts by ministers to keep the policy under wraps until after the general election.In the latest defeat for ministers over their continued failure to tackle the UK＊s air pollution crisis, ,, Mr Justice Garnham said the secretary of state, Andrea Leadsom, was in breach of a court order to take action in the shortest possible time and that any further delays would constitute a further breach.He said it was essential to publish draft plans to cut air pollution immediately to safeguard public health. The judge rejected a government application to appeal, saying that ministers would have to go to the appeal court if they wanted to seek permission to challenge his ruling.The judgment came after ministers applied to court to keep their plans secret until after the general election, saying it was necessary to ※comply with pre-election propriety rules§. The new measures are likely to include the imposition of multiple clean-air zones across the country, where drivers will face fines if their vehicles do not pass roadside emissions tests.Garnham on Thursday ordered ministers to publish their draft plan within two weeks 每 on 9 May, after local elections on 4 May 每 and said the government must comply with his original order and release their final policy on tackling the air crisis by 31 July.※These steps are necessary in order to safeguard public health,§ said the judge. ※The continued failure of the government to comply with directives and regulations constitutes a significant threat to public health.§The judge said the government＊s own figures showed that nitrogen dioxide pollution 每 primarily from diesel traffic 每 is linked to the premature deaths of 23,500 people a year in the UK. ※That is more than 64 deaths each day,§ Garnham said. The court decided that the threat to public health constituted ※exceptional circumstances§, which meant purdah guidelines in the runup to a general election could be waived. ※Immediate publication [of the policy] is essential,§ he said.Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said common sense had prevailed. ※The nation＊s dirty air is one of the most important public health issues in recent times. The high court＊s decision recognises the need to urgently tackle this crisis.§Last November, ministers were taken to court by the environmental group ClientEarth over their failure to take measures to reduce air pollution, which put them in breach of EU law and domestic regulations.The judge found for ClientEarth and said the government＊s original plans were . The plans included five clean-air zones where diesel drivers faced charges if their cars did not pass emissions tests. The judge  to come up with a new draft policy to tackle air pollution from diesel traffic.On Thursday the government was called to court by Garnham to explain why it had made a last-minute application late last Friday to delay publication of a draft policy to tackle air pollution until after the general election.James Eadie QC, representing the government, said the new policy was ready to be published, but that it would be controversial and should therefore be withheld until after the election.※If you publish a draft plan, it drops all the issues of controversy into the election ＃ like dropping a controversial bomb,§ he said, adding that this could risk breaching rules about civil service neutrality and could lead to the policy being labelled a Tory plan.But Garnham said in his judgment that purdah was not a principle of law and the exceptional circumstances of the threat to public health that meant its rules could be overridden.※It does not give ministers a defence to the principles of private and public law ＃ It is not binding on the courts. It provides no immediate right for an extension of time to comply with an order of the court. It is not a trump card,§ he said.The judge said the court had in  Leadsom to publish the draft plan to tackle illegal levels of air pollution across the country and that she had still failed to do so.※In November 2016, I found the secretary of state was in breach of directives and regulations. The secretary of state remains in breach. She is obliged to comply as soon as possible.§ Garnham added that any further delay would constitute a further breach.James Thornton, CEO of ClientEarth, welcomed the ruling. He said: ※The government has never stopped delaying when it comes to cleaning up our air. I would urge them not to appeal and to get on with it. Enough dithering. The judge was extremely clear.§Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, said it was the third time the government had lost in court over the issue.※The government must publish their air quality plan without delay. A Labour government would bring forward a new Clean Air Act setting out how we would tackle air pollution.§Liberal Democrat Ed Davey, former secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: ※This is a dramatic defeat for the Conservative government. Ministers have used taxpayer money to try to hide proof of their environmental failures. And they have even failed there, too.※With scientists showing the health impact of air pollution being far worse than we thought, it is disgraceful for the Conservatives to try to bury the truth from voters.§ Jonathan Bartley, Green party co-leader, said the government＊s attempt to delay publishing its policy showed ※disdain for public health and a complete failure to grasp the extent of the emergency facing the UK§.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he was pleased that ministers now had to face up to their responsibilities. ※Ministers were dragged kicking and screaming to face the huge scale of this health crisis but rather than take action, they used the election as a smokescreen to hold back their plan.§"

"Avoiding dangerous levels of climate change is still just about possible, but will require unprecedented effort and coordination from governments, businesses, citizens and scientists in the next three years, a group of prominent experts has warned. Warnings over global warming have picked up pace in recent months, even as the political environment has grown chilly with Donald Trump＊s formal announcement of the . This year＊s weather has beaten high temperature records in some regions, and .But while temperatures have risen, global carbon dioxide emissions have stayed broadly flat for the past three years. This gives hope that the worst effects of climate change 每 devastating droughts, floods, heatwaves and irreversible sea level rises 每 may be avoided, according to a letter published in the journal Nature this week.The authors, including former UN climate chief  and Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, argue that the next three years will be crucial. They calculate that if emissions can be brought permanently lower by 2020 then the temperature thresholds leading to runaway irreversible climate change will not be breached.Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, under whom the Paris agreement was signed, said: ※We stand at the doorway of being able to bend the emissions curve downwards by 2020, as science demands, in protection of the UN sustainable development goals, and in particular the eradication of extreme poverty. This monumental challenge coincides with an unprecedented openness to self-challenge on the part of sub-national governments inside the US, governments at all levels outside the US, and of the private sector in general. The opportunity given to us over the next three years is unique in history.§Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, added: ※The maths is brutally clear: while the world can＊t be healed within the next few years, it may be fatally wounded by negligence [before] 2020.§Scientists have been warning that time is fast running out to stave off the worst effects of warming, and some milestones may have slipped out of reach. In the Paris agreement, governments pledged an ※aspirational§ goal of holding warming to no more than 1.5C, a level which it is hoped will spare most of the world＊s lowest-lying islands from inundation. Paris＊s less stringent, but firmer, goal of preventing warming from exceeding 2C above pre-industrial levels . The authors point to signs that the trend of upward emissions is being reversed, and to technological progress that promises lower emissions for the future. , creating a foundation for permanently lowering emissions. Coal use is showing  in key regions, including China and India. Governments, despite Trump＊s pronouncements, are forging ahead with plans to reduce greenhouse gases.The authors called for political and business leaders to continue tackling emissions and meeting the Paris goals without the US. ※As before Paris, we must remember that impossible is not a fact, it＊s an attitude,§ they wrote.They set out six goals for 2020 which they said could be adopted at the G20 meeting in Hamburg on 7-8 July. These include increasing renewable energy to 30% of electricity use; plans from leading cities and states to decarbonise by 2050; 15% of new vehicles sold to be electric; and reforms to land use, agriculture, heavy industry and the finance sector, to encourage green growth.Prof Gail Whiteman said the signs from technical innovation and economics were encouraging: ※Climate science underlines the unavoidable urgency of our challenge, but equally important is the fact that the economic, technical and social analyses show that we can resoundingly rise to the challenge through collective action.§While the greenhouse gases poured into the atmosphere over the last two centuries have only gradually taken effect, future changes are likely to be faster, scientists fear. Johan Rockstr?m of the Stockholm Resilience Centre said: ※We have been blessed by a remarkably resilient planet over the past 100 years, able to absorb most of our climate abuse. Now we have reached the end of this era, and need to bend the global curve of emissions immediately, to avoid unmanageable outcomes for our modern world.§"																																																			
"The public is invited to help reassemble a giant jigsaw in a  museum, 157 years after two Somerset fishermen went out to catch a ※great fish§ and brought back a northern bottlenosed whale more than eight metres (26ft) long.Their catch was a local sensation: the carcass went on a west country tour then the skeleton was displayed for years hanging from the ceiling of the museum in Weston-super-Mare. It was dismantled in 1948 and transferred to . As there has never been space to reassemble it, the bones have been scattered across cupboards, drawers and racks in several storerooms at two sites, with only the skull on display.The museum manager, Jack Ashby, said though the whale was the largest specimen in its collection, because all the bones have never been laid out, the weekend will be the first chance to check if it is the complete skeleton. Any gaps would not be surprising in a collection that includes a 每 now restored and standing on a 3D-printed replica fourth leg 每 and half a dodo rediscovered in a drawer labelled as a crocodile.All the whale bones will be brought together for cleaning this weekend and the public is invited to drop in to help: there is 157 years of grime to remove as well as the bones to sort and lay out. ※The vast majority of most museums＊ specimens are not on public display,§ Ashby said. ※The Whale Weekender will allow people to get very hands-on with one of those specimens 每 and we are really excited about it.§The whale, whose scientific name is is rarely spotted as it dives for fish and squid in the deepest seas.

"ctualmente sumido en una crisis de agua potable,  enfrenta las consecuencias de las pol赤ticas de la dictadura del Gral. Augusto Pinochet que pusieron casi todos los suministros de agua dulce y los servicios relacionados con el agua del pa赤s en manos de las corporaciones multinacionales. Pero la soluci車n a esta crisis, que est芍 empeorando, la tiene un inopinado grupo de maestros canadienses.En 1981, el c車digo de agua de Pinochet re-defini車 a este recurso como un bien comercializable. Desde entonces, las corporaciones han podido presentar ofertas para el uso de los derechos estatales del agua, para su reventa mediante un sistema de asignaci車n basado en el mercado, con m赤nimo control por parte del gobierno. S車lo unos cuantos otros pa赤ses han apostado por una reducci車n tan dr芍stica del control del estado sobre los recursos de agua. El sistema de mercado ha creado conflictos sobre los recursos h赤dricos y la p谷rdida de derechos de agua de las comunidades ind赤genas, como los atacame?os,  que sustentaban sus modos de vida y actividades culturales a lo largo del r赤o Loa.Asimismo,  cuenta con la mayor cantidad de servicios privatizados de agua y saneamiento en el mundo; el 95.8% de la poblaci車n utiliza servicios privados. Sin embargo, globalmente, m芍s del 90% de los servicios de agua y saneamiento son financiados y gestionados p迆blicamente gracias a una feroz oposici車n al manejo del agua con fines de lucro, que t赤picamente resulta en tarifas m芍s altas y menos rendici車n de cuentas.Alrededor del mundo, han habido comunidades que han detenido la privatizaci車n del agua y los servicios de saneamiento; el , una ONG holandesa, ha documentado los casos de  [pdf], [pdf]. Una creciente oposici車n a la privatizaci車n en Chile ha seguido esta tendencia pero con un giro inesperado. El  (Plan de Pensi車n de Maestros de Ontario, u OTPP por sus siglas en ingl谷s) es actualmente el inversionista m芍s grande en materia de agua y saneamiento en Chile, con participaci車n mayoritaria en tres grandes servicios de agua chilenos 每 ,  y  每 controlando el 41% del sector. Chile cuenta con cobertura de agua casi universal; el 99% de la poblaci車n . La casi total universalidad a menudo se pone como un ejemplo de los beneficios de la privatizaci車n, pero 谷sta en realidad  [pdf], antes de que el sector fuera privatizado.A pesar de que, durante la era de Pinochet, otros bienes p迆blicos fueron vendidos, el estado continu車 realizando grandes inversiones en el agua y saneamiento, el cual fue el 迆ltimo sector en privatizarse. Las corporaciones privadas  en 1999: en ese momento las pol赤ticas de la era de Pinochet hab赤an creado un ambiente altamente favorable para los inversionistas privados, incluyendo una En medio de los patrones meteorol車gicos extremos vinculados con el cambio clim芍tico, las inversiones en las mejoras y el mantenimiento de la infraestructura por parte de los servicios financiados por la OTPP no cumplen con los lineamientos chilenos.  [pdf] que Aguas del Valle invirti車 tan s車lo 49% del m赤nimo recomendado en 2014, mientras que Essbio y Esval invirtieron 75% y 64%. Y todo esto mientras que las tarifas de agua  de Latinoam谷rica.Mientras tanto, los servicios corporativos han mantenido el derecho de determinar a qu谷 芍reas dar provisi車n, lo que ha resultado en varias ※zonas sin servicio§ fuera de los rentables centros urbanos. ?stas a menudo son dirigidas por voluntarios de la comunidad, en un esquema sin fines de lucro, mediante asociaciones conocidas como Agua Potable Rural (APR).En la provincia de Petorca, donde el agua es escasa, las concesiones por parte del estado para la extracci車n del agua exceden los recursos disponibles. En el pueblo de Cabildo, los peque?os agricultores reclaman que un permiso concedido a Esval ha causado grandes impactos en sus propios suministros de agua, pero sus esfuerzos legales para rescindir el acceso de Esval no han tenido 谷xito. Mientras tanto, las APR, que opera con recursos insuficientes en las zonas del 芍rea sin servicio, muchas veces se quedan sin agua durante los per赤odos de sequ赤a. Ricardo Sanguesa Botella, presidente de la asociaci車n local de irrigadores, y , la red regional de peque?os agricultores, aseveran tambi谷n que cuando las fuentes de agua se secan durante la temporada de sequ赤a, Esval compra agua de pozos ilegales 每 aquellos que operan sin licencia 每 con el fin de proveer agua por medio de camiones de emergencia. Al ser contactados para pedir un comentario, Esval dijo: ※Chile, y espec赤ficamente el 芍rea de Petorca, se han visto afectadas por sequ赤as severas durante los 迆ltimos ocho a?os. Enfrentar este escenario ha significado un gran esfuerzo por parte de nuestra empresa, y gracias a un trabajo arduo logramos para nuestros clientes un suministro continuo sin alteraciones. Durante este periodo, tuvimos que reforzar nuestra producci車n con la contribuci車n de fuentes externas. Contamos con proveedores externos que, como requisito b芍sico, poseen derechos de aprovechamiento de aguas subterr芍neas en la zona, las cuales garantizan su operaci車n; as赤 aseguramos que la fuente de agua est谷 en orden y cumpla con la legislaci車n vigente.§Sin embargo, la obtenci車n del agua por medio de pozos ilegales es un problema que va en aumento en Chile, ya que las multas impuestas son muy bajas para ser un factor disuasivo eficaz. Adem芍s, el estado chileno no supervisa los or赤genes del agua transportada en camiones por compa?赤as privadas durante los per赤odos de crisis.El mito del 谷xito del modelo chileno ha sobrevivido porque las consecuencias de la privatizaci車n han sido menos severas que en otros pa赤ses m芍s pobres. Pero a medida que los beneficios de las d谷cadas de fuerte inversi車n p迆blica van escaseando, y la realidad del cambio clim芍tico se hace evidente, los servicios privados est芍n siendo expuestos.Varios grupos de justicia del agua en Chile 每 tales como Modatima,  y  每 est芍n exigiendo poner fin a la privatizaci車n, pero no ser芍 f芍cil arrebatar el poder de las manos de las corporaciones en la era de los acuerdos de libre comercio.

Pero la interacci車n entre mercados de agua, servicios privados, el cambio clim芍tico y el derecho humano al agua es compleja. En lugar de luchar por un retiro inmediato de las inversiones, los grupos de justicia del agua piden que los maestros de Ontario se unan a la discusi車n en torno a una transici車n justa y sostenible del control privado del agua hacia el control p迆blico en Chile.El primer paso tomado es  pidiendo a la OTPP sumarse al di芍logo con los grupos chilenos para explorar estrategias, as赤 como un plazo realista para devolver el agua y saneamiento a las manos de los poderes p迆blicos.La crisis del agua en Chile es compleja, pero ofrece una oportunidad 迆nica a los maestros canadienses para apoyar al creciente movimiento anti-privatizaci車n, y ayudar a liberar a los chilenos de las cadenas de la era de Pinochet."																																																			
"On May 31st Kenya celebrated the inauguration of the first phase of the new high-speed rail link from Mombasa to Nairobi. Now Kenyans can travel between the two largest cities quickly and cheaply. Accelerated movement of cargo and people will mean more trade, more income generation, and therefore, more jobs, and that＊s good for our youthful nation. Much less widely reported were results of studies by , which reveal that Kenya＊s wildlife numbers are plummeting. Some of our most treasured animals, such as hirola, rhinos, cheetah, lions, and giraffe, are being pushed to the brink of extinction. Nearly every region and habitat in the country is in trouble, except Laikipia county. But even here, hard-earned conservation gains of past decades are in danger of being wiped out in a single year. The county is reeling under the combined impact of drought and an , as armed herders invade properties, kill wildlife, burn down houses and terrorise local landowners. One Laikipia ranch claims to have lost a 70% of its wildlife in a single year. Tourism accounts for over 12% of the nation＊s GDP and employs over 300,000 Kenyans. As a mainstay of tourism, wildlife is a key driver of the economy. Despite this, it seems that wildlife conservation is increasingly misaligned with Kenya＊s key development priorities: jobs, food security, ending poverty, health care and education for all. To those in the halls of power who decide what matters and what doesn＊t, all of these goals are ultimately tied to a vision of Kenya becoming an industrialised nation, the unquestioned goal of our vision for 2030. What an industrialised nation looks however needs to be defined as an image that includes all the trappings of advanced infrastructure and systems: institutions that function efficiently, a democracy that works, a healthy environment with effective waste management, adequate water and clean energy, and liveable cities with open spaces to serve the social and mental needs of the people. An industrialised Kenya will still need wilderness and natural forests to soak up carbon and release fresh air and clean water, and parks and reserves to safeguard our unique natural heritage.Our recent history shows the danger of ignoring the value of nature to our health and wealth. The country is hurtling along an accelerated course of development that is blind to the environmental damage it causes, dodging conservationists as if we are potholes on the road in an imaginary race to a finish line. This is a route that leads to pollution, rivers clogged with plastic waste, habitat loss as rural landscapes are built on or converted to agriculture, and massive infrastructure developments across our wildernesses. The damage caused by the poor planning of dams, farms, ports, roads and railways is rapidly outpacing our ability to respond. Floods and droughts are causing more deaths than ever; traffic congestion threatens gridlock in our cities; air pollution in Nairobi is among the world＊s worst. Chemicals are distributed like candy to farmers and it＊s no surprise that Kenya has one of fastest rising rates of cancer among young people. The growing mental health problem is something we haven＊t even started talking about. What＊s most troubling is our collective failure to respond. It seems that Kenyans no longer value or aspire to healthy environments. We don＊t even notice that there are no more clean-flowing rivers, or know that we are losing the biodiversity in our natural forests. We might notice that it＊s getting hotter and drier and plant a few trees to feel good, but we don＊t stop the illegal logging. It＊s too much effort challenging the authorities when there＊s no political will. So we also ignore the trucks that are dredging up sand and destroying our rivers and turn a blind eye to the dumping of waste on roadsides and into the city streams. Those who can afford to, fence themselves off from the mass of humanity, hiding the poverty and filth on their doorstep, and travel to faraway places to enjoy fresh air and stunning sunsets. Surveys reveal that most Kenyan youth see wildlife as irrelevant, something that benefits a few, rich visitors or white landowners. The disconnect between people and nature allows influential people to argue conservation is an outmoded western construct that has no place in modern Kenya and to justify inaction as our wildlife disappears. Public lack of concern means that conservation organizations are marginalised and reduced to fighting rear-guard actions on the streets or in the courts. But these can only address high profile cases, such as the  and the〞in my view〞disastrous . In these cases, we may have some success, at least in wringing concessions from policy makers. But there is nothing we can do〞we simply don＊t have the resources〞to halt the countless small acts of vandalism against the natural environment that are occurring under the radar.In the same way, the murder and assault of white landowners by armed militias in Laikipia has rightly provoked an outcry among Kenyans and in the international media. But the murder at least 50 local people so far this year, and the untold damage caused by illegal incursions of cattle into protected areas〞in Laikipia and across the country〞go largely unreported. But conservations are also to blame for our isolation, since we have failed to respond to the unfolding crisis with a clear vision that makes wildlife conservation relevant to all Kenyans and provides opportunities for them to participate in achieving it. It is not too late. We can change the course of history by reconnecting our people to nature〞both emotionally, by fostering pride in our country＊s unique wildlife heritage, and economically, by ensuring that ordinary people see tangible benefits from conservation of wildlife and the environment.This month the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources launched a consultation exercise intended to provide guidelines for a new wildlife strategy. I urge all Kenyans to take this rare opportunity to articulate a future in which each of us is a part of the solution. Conservationists will need to make compromises in order to reach agreement among the most important stakeholders〞landowners, communities, businesses, and the tourism sector〞around an approach to conservation that is compatible with the national development agenda. We should seize this opportunity to regroup around a new vision of conservation that delivers justice to wildlife and people, and that all Kenyans can aspire to.

"urrently in the throes of a freshwater crisis,  is facing the consequences of Pinochet-era policies that have left nearly all the country＊s freshwater supplies and water-related services in the hands of multinational corporations. But the solution to this worsening crisis lies in the hands of some unlikely suspects: Canadian teachers.In 1981, Pinochet＊s water code redefined water as a tradable good. Since then, corporations have been able to bid for water usage rights from the state and resell them through a market-based allocation system, with little public oversight. Only a handful of countries have attempted such a drastic retrenchment of state control over water resources.The market system has led to conflicts over water resources and to the loss of water rights of indigenous communities, such as the Atacame?o people  that sustained their livelihoods and cultural activities along the Loa River.In addition, Chile has the most privatised water and sanitation services in the world; 95.8% of the population is served by private utilities. Globally, however, more than 90% of water and sanitation services are publicly-funded and managed thanks to fierce opposition to for-profit water, which typically results in higher tariffs and reduced accountability. Communities around the world have stopped the privatisation of water and sanitation services; the , a Dutch NGO, has documented the cases of Growing opposition to privatisation in Chile follows this trend but has an unexpected twist. The  (OTPP) is currently the largest investor in Chile＊s water and sanitation, holding majority shares in three large Chilean water utilities 每 ,  and  每 and with 41% of the sector under its control.Chile has near universal water coverage; 99% of the population . This near-universality is often claimed as one of the benefits of privatisation but was in fact , before the sector was privatised.While other public assets were sold off during the Pinochet era, the state continued to invest heavily in water and sanitation 每 it was the last sector to be privatised. Private corporations  in 1999, by which point Pinochet-era policies had created an environment highly-favourable to foreign investors, including a Amid extreme weather patterns linked to climate change, investments in infrastructure upgrades and maintenance by OTPP-funded utilities fall short of Chilean guidelines.  that Aguas del Valle invested just 49% of the recommended minimum in 2014, while Essbio and Esval invested 75% and 64%. And all while water tariffs  in Latin America. Meanwhile, corporate utilities have maintained the right to determine which areas to service, leading to a number of ※non-utility zones§ outside profitable urban centres. These are often run by community volunteers on a not-for-profit basis through associations known as Agua Potable Rural (APR).In the water-scarce province of Petorca, water extraction permits granted by the state exceed available resources. In the town of Cabildo, smallholder farmers claim that a water permit granted to Esval is having drastic impacts on their own water supplies, but their legal efforts to have Esval＊s access rescinded have been unsuccessful. Meanwhile, under-resourced APRs operating in the area＊s non-utility zones often run out of water during periods of drought.Ricardo Sanguesa Botella, president of the local irrigators＊ association, and , the regional smallholder farmers＊ network, also claim that when water sources run dry in the drought season, Esval purchases water from illegal wells 每 those operating without permits 每 in order to provide water through emergency trucks. When approached for comment, Esval said: ※Chile, and specifically the Petorca area, have been affected by a severe drought over the last eight years. Facing this scenario has meant a great effort for our company and thanks to arduous work we achieve a continuous water supply without alterations for our clients. During this period we had to reinforce our production with the contribution of external sources. We count on external suppliers who, as a basic requirement, have groundwater rights in the area that guarantee their operation, so we ensure that the water source is in order and complies with current legislation.§Esval did not reply to questions regarding the measures taken to ensure compliance of third party sources with Chilean regulations.However, obtaining water through illegal wells is a growing problem in Chile as the penalties imposed are too negligible to be an effective deterrent. In addition, the Chilean state does not track the origins of water trucked by private companies during periods of crisis. The myth of the successful Chilean model has survived because the consequences of privatisation have been less dire than in poorer countries. But as the benefits of decades of strong public investment wane, and the reality of climate change sets in, private utilities are being exposed.Water justice groups in Chile 每 such as Modatima,  and 每 are demanding an end to privatisation, but it will not be easy to wrest power from the hands of corporations in the era of free trade agreements. Chile has signed 26 trade agreements covering 62 countries, including Canada, since the late 1990s. These agreements lock in the rights of corporations who have the power to sue Chile if the government attempts to tighten regulation.Chilean environmental groups, labour unions and community organisations recently partnered with the  to highlight the OTTP＊s role in Chile＊s water crisis. But the interplay between water markets, private services, climate change and the human right to water is complex. Rather than pushing for an immediate divestment, water justice groups would like Ontario teachers to simply join the discussion around a just and sustainable transition from private to public control of water in Chile.The first step they can take is to  asking the OTPP to engage in a dialogue with the Chilean groups exploring strategies and a realistic timeline to bring water and sanitation back into public hands.The water crisis in Chile is complex, but it provides a unique opportunity for Canadian teachers to support the growing anti-privatisation movement, and help to free Chileans from the shackles of the Pinochet era."

"On a frosty Friday evening at the end of January, after her usual walk around her central Stuttgart neighbourhood, Susanne Jallow felt an unusual cough and irritation in her throat.Jallow, 54, lives in Neckartor, an area chock-a-block with residential buildings hugged by a busy road, B14, which handles around 100,000 vehicles a day.Neckartor is a hotspot for air pollution, not just in Stuttgart but in . PM10 values (coarse dust particles between 10 and 2.5 micrometres in diameter) recorded on sensors installed in the busy intersection of B14 often hit  (?g/m?).  set the top limit of safe PM10 levels at 50?g/m?.On this particular evening, however, Jallow came home and checked the readings on a sensor hanging from her balcony, provided to her as part of an open data citizen initiative called  (※air data§), and found that it had recorded 300?g/m?. Keen to draw attention to the scale of Stuttgart＊s problem, Jallow and her neighbour Peter Erben 每 both members of local citizens＊ forum  每 lodged a  on 23 January against the city＊s mayor, Fritz Kuhn, and the district president, Wolfgang Reimer. The complaint accuses the officials on two counts: bodily injury with death as a consequence (due to air pollution), and lack of assistance.The issue was immediately picked up by local media. ※We wanted to highlight the bureaucratic apathy of the city administration. There is a pressing need for more proactive measures to combat air pollution. The existing ones are inadequate,§ says Erben.He suspects other neighbourhoods in Stuttgart are just as in danger of air pollution from PM10 and nitrogen dioxide as Neckartor is. ※Right now, the official explanation is that only Neckartor suffers from bad air in all of Stuttgart. I don＊t necessarily think that is true.§Popular resistance to air pollution in Stuttgart has been ongoing for more than a decade. In the autumn of 2004, two of its citizens approached the court seeking redressal from air pollution and . The government reacted by introducing a truck transit ban that did little to control PM levels. In  每 and the court, in its ruling, noted that no effective measures had been taken to address the city＊s poor air quality. The concept of  (※fine particulate matter alarm§) was introduced in  to mark the days when the city＊s air pollution exceeds EU limits. On these days, the city administration urges residents to stop using their wood-fired chimneys and utilise public transportation rather than cars 每 tickets are reduced to half price as an incentive. Last year, Stuttgart breached the EU＊s daily permitted PM10 levels on  每 almost double the allowed 35 days. ※Combustion residues, mainly from diesel engines, as well as the abrasion of brakes and tyres, are the main reasons for these high PM10 values,§ says Dr Ulrich Vogt, head of the  at Stuttgart University. One reason for Stuttgart＊s heavy traffic is that it doesn＊t possess any ring roads, so much of the traffic passes straight through the city. In contrast, Munich has three ring roads.※Another reason we have such a high concentration [of air pollution] is that everything is very, very densely populated,§ Vogt says. ※Stuttgart west has the highest population density in . There are no broad avenues here, only narrow street canyons.§But the problem is also geographical: Stuttgart＊s city centre is located in a basin, surrounded by mountains on three sides. ※We do not have good ventilation and hence no way of diluting the air pollutants,§ Vogt adds.Winter brings further weather-related issues: ※We are now experiencing a phenomenon called temperature inversion. It acts like a lid, trapping cold air in the ground without allowing for exchange,§ explains Dr Ulrich Reuter, an environment counsellor with Stuttgart＊s Office of Environmental Protection. From Reuter＊s office window on a late January afternoon, the city＊s landmark  (TV tower) is shrouded in thick smog. ※I hope it will be possible to bring down the pollution levels,§ he says. ※But I＊m afraid it＊s not possible without restrictions.§ ※The politicians are satisfied with Feinstaubalarm without considering any other action,§ says Jallow. ※Why can＊t we have a ban on vehicular traffic on pollution days, like  and ?§But such a ban would be controversial in the industrial city home to major manufacturers including Porsche, Daimler and NeoPlan (the maker of Man buses and trucks).※I think it would be fatal,§ Thomas Bareiss, the , told a . ※Even the discussion about driving bans will lead to the destruction of [Stuttgart]. There are more intelligent ways to tackle the fine dust problem.§But according to Julia Pieper, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport for the state of Baden W邦rttemberg, of which Stuttgart is the capital, traffic restrictions are being considered for next year.※In the eventuality that the 2017 limit values are not met, traffic restrictions on individual days are planned for the year 2018,§ Pieper told the Guardian. ※In doing so, the affected area is kept as small as possible.§In the month of January alone, the city experienced around 25 of the acceptable 35 Feinstaubalarm days 每 so restrictions look certain to be introduced next year.The grubby, soot-laden walls of the grand old houses that sit along B14 in Neckartor bear the tell-tale signs of air pollution.※You can only imagine what the lungs of people who live inside those houses look like,§ says Erben, rubbing his fingers across the soot. An acrid smell hangs heavily in the air, resulting from the emissions let out by the cars hurtling past the busy intersection.Experts such as Vogt and Reuter agree a reduction in car traffic is the most effective measure for improvement of air quality. ※Every microgram per cubic metre of PM10 is unhealthy,§ Vogt says. ※So there is no threshold value or lower limit [of acceptability].§There is certainly growing awareness of the issue among Stuttgart residents.  is in the process of installing low cost, crowdfunded sensors across the city to measure PM levels, much like the one on Jallow＊s balcony.※I wanted to build cost-effective sensors, given the less than reliable government data and coverage regarding air pollution,§ explains Jan Lutz, a social entrepreneur who runs Luftdaten＊s website.※But I think in five years Stuttgart will be like Detroit or something, because there is simply no innovation,§ he adds. ※The automobile industry continues to produce more cars, which is basically two tonnes of steel transporting a 70kg human. It＊s an overkill, and not sustainable in the long run.§"																																																			
"Very soon, a large portion of an ice shelf in Antarctica will break off and collapse into the ocean. The name of the ice shelf is ; it is a major extension of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and its health has implications for other ice in the region, and sea levels globally.How do we know a portion is going to collapse? Well, scientists have been watching a major rift (crack) that has grown in the past few years, carving out a 5,000 sq km section of floating ice, nearly the size of Delaware. The speed of the crack has increased dramatically in the past few months, and it is nearly split through. provides frequent updates on the Larsen C shelf. You can read a summary there, which reports: Dr Stefan Rahmstorf provided me an excellent image from his book . This image shows prior breakup of regions A and B (along with the location and size of part C).Why does all this matter? Well it is important for a number of reasons. First, when an ice shelf melts or collapses, it can unpin other ice that is sitting on land, which allows it to flow more quickly into the ocean. It is this secondary effect 每 the loss of ice resting on land 每 that changes the rate of sea level rise. Loss of a major ice shelf can also activate ice that rests on bedrock topography that makes it fundamentally unstable 每 ice that, once moving, will move faster and faster, until a large region is afloat. The entire Larsen Ice shelf, which is the fourth largest in Antarctica, covers nearly 50,000 square km (20,000 square miles) according to reporting at . The ice on the land upstream of the shelf is enough to raise sea level, eventually, by 10cm. This is not, by itself, a major threat to the world＊s coastlines, but it reveals the path that other, even larger areas are likely to take in the future.Perhaps a quotation from a seminal work on Antarctic ice sheets best sums up the situation. , John Mercer from the Institute of Polar studies concluded: Why is part of the ice shelf going to break off and collapse into the ocean? Since large calving events are so rare, and since our measurements in and around ice shelves don＊t go back in time far enough, it＊s hard to say whether this is a natural progression, variability, or a result of human activity (or more likely a mixture of both). One reason may be human-caused warming, which has led to melting from both above and below in nearby areas and is widely accepted to have contributed to the disintegration of nearby Larsen A and Larsen B. The Western Antarctic (the parts south of the US) is warming quite quickly, faster than most of the planet. In addition, warmer waters can reach underneath the ice shelf and can melt it from below.That being said, there are vigorous discussions within the scientific community about how much, if any of this can be attributed to humans. Some scientists think there is strong connection; others are much less sure and see little or no evidence that humans are the cause. From my vantage point, part of this relates to our limited ability to measure what＊s going on, and part of this is a common sticking point of whether an absence of evidence is evidence of an absence. I＊ve heard from multiple differing views on this very topic while preparing this post. From my research and experience in climate science as well as in many other areas of research where risk analysis and evidence are weighed, we should assume that human-caused warming is having an effect. We can measure the incredible amount of heat that is being stored in the oceans as well as the increase in temperatures that have occurred over the Western Antarctica and changes to the ocean currents in the region 每 there must be some implications to the health of the ice. The real question, in my mind, is how much of the effect is humans? That is something a lot more research will be required for answering.What we are really concerned about isn＊t just this breaking event that will occur quite soon. We are more concerned about the rest of the Larsen C ice shelf. Will it disintegrate when the protective shelf is gone? If it does disintegrate, will the ice up-land follow suit, and flow into the oceans thereby further increasing sea levels?When people ask, how much will sea levels rise by 2100, my answer is ※one meter§. Why do experts think this when we＊ve only had a fifth of that over the past 100 years?  rise is accelerating 每 it＊s getting faster and faster as the accumulated heat from greenhouse gases takes hold. Part of the reason for the acceleration is phenomena such as ice shelf loss. It may take a while for an ice shelf to melt but when it does, the losses occur quickly.Just a week or so after  from the world＊s best hope of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, . One of the unstoppable consequences of melting ice and rising seas is the inundation of coastal communities. In the US, Miami is our bellwether city. It is a large city built on the coast, and it will be devastated by rising seas. You cannot build a sea wall around Miami 每 the porous substrate means that water will just soak up from below. As Miami deals with a devastating one meter of sea level rise by 2100, they can thank their senator Marco Rubio along with Donald Trump. Marco Rubio has long argued against taking action on climate change and he has even . Now, because of rising sea levels, even very high tides are causing flooding in Miami. I cannot imagine what another one meter of sea level will do. But, certainly there will be a lot of money spent and resources lost dealing with this problem that could have been avoided.

"ntil now, at least for those watching from afar, the Trump show has been a spectacle. It has shocked and appalled, but with the compulsive appeal of something like entertainment.

Indeed, the latest episode of the Trump-Russia drama promises a cameo role for our own Nigel Farage, now named as a  (even if voters in seven UK parliamentary contests deemed him anything but).Meanwhile, Trump＊s tweets have provided a daily source of jaw-dropping amusement for a global audience, a phenomenon that reached a peak with the kerfuffle over ※covfefe§, the apparently mistyped word in an incomplete tweet that the president posted after midnight on Wednesday.The meme artists got to work on that one, imagining covfefe might be Trump＊s safe word, or else an incantation that could summon .

And suddenly Trump wasn＊t so funny any more.The consequences seem obvious. An accord that took years to broker, painstakingly put together in 2015 after failure at Copenhagen in 2009: a deal that brought together the powerhouses of India and China as well as the old world polluters of Europe and sought, at one minute to midnight, to do something to save our precious planet 每 that deal will now have to proceed without the world＊s biggest economy and dominant superpower. It is an act of the most wanton vandalism, taking a delicate structure assembled piece by piece by all humanity 每 and kicking it with a steel-toecapped boot. The environmentalist  succinctly: ※It amounts to a thorough repudiation of two of the civilising forces on our planet: diplomacy and science.§Why would anyone do such a thing? The evidence of climate change and its destructive effects are as visible in the US as anywhere: on current projections, Trump＊s own Florida resort of . It can＊t be that the president felt bound by the campaign promises he had made: he breaks those casually, whether it＊s a commitment to deprive no Americans of existing healthcare coverage, or a pledge to shift the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (an incendiary promise  this week).The speech announcing his decision gave it a philosophical patina, as Trump returned to the ※America first§ theme of his inaugural address, describing the world as a site of  in which global cooperation is for wimps and suckers.Any deal that delighted humanity as much as the Paris accord had done 每 ※,§ Trump recalled with lip-curled distaste 每 could only mean the United States was getting screwed. Or as he put it, the world was glad, ※for the simple reason that [the Paris accord] put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage§.Naturally, : Trump reckoned that the people who put him in the White House, especially blue collar workers in the rust-belt states, have long seen global warming as a con. And they＊re the ones he needs to keep sweet in time for next year＊s midterm elections, and his own bid for a second term in 2020.I＊d suggest that even that level of calculation gives Trump too much credit. Sure, he declared his love for coalminers, as if withdrawing from Paris is going to save their industry when  for a century, and fewer Americans mine coal than work in . But this being Trump, you need to look for even baser motives.A desire to upend one of his predecessor＊s big achievements will be one of them. But just as likely, surely, is that Trump was irritated by his treatment during last week＊s Nato and G7 summits, and wanted to hit back. The Europeans barely hid their disdain for him, and so he seized the chance to deprive them of something they cherished.If we were discussing a normal president, it would be absurd to bring up such things, but Emmanuel Macron might have erred when he made public his deliberate attempt to out-alpha Trump with a . Trump would think nothing of getting his own back by burning the entire planet. Witness the White House aide who confessed that European leaders＊ , while another said Trump saw the disappointment of European allies as a .This, then, is the measure of the man in charge of the world＊s most powerful nation. Consolation comes from the fact that others have stepped in to fill the void he has created. Inside the US, states and cities have said they will continue to honour their commitments, regardless of Trump＊s tantrum. ※I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,§ Trump said, whereupon the  and promised to abide by the agreement. Trump was perhaps unaware that in Pennsylvania renewable energy  每 more than oil, gas and mining combined.Globally, it was a similar story, with Angela Merkel and Macron (but not, take note, Theresa May) apparently vying for the title to which Trump has lost all claim: leader of the free world. ※,§ said Macron in an English-language video rebuttal of Trump. More quietly, China has signalled its own readiness to take up the role vacated by the US and, starting with climate change, to act as the dominant global power.That＊s good for the planet, but not so great for the world. Of course, when it comes to climate change, some leadership is better than none; but the notion of an international order underpinned by China, a dictatorship, is hardly a cheering prospect.Yet this is the future that Trump, who last week refused to reaffirm the Nato principle of collective self-defence, is inviting. The New York Times columnist David Brooks greeted the Paris decision with a declaration that Trump is making ※§. That is strong, but not far off the truth.

"Who says exercise is always good for you?  to work in certain highly polluted cities could be more dangerous to your health than not doing it at all, according to researchers.In cities such as Allahabad in India, or Zabol in Iran, the long-term damage from inhaling fine particulates could outweigh the usual health gains of cycling after just 30 minutes. In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, this tipping point happens after just 45 minutes a day cycling along busy roads. In Delhi or the Chinese city of Xingtai, meanwhile, residents pass what the researchers call the ※breakeven point§ after an hour. Other exercise with the same intensity as cycling 每 such as slow jogging 每 would have the same effect.※If you are beyond the breakeven point, you may be doing yourself more harm than good,§ said Audrey de Nazelle, a lecturer in air pollution management at Imperial College＊s Centre for Environmental Policy, and one of the authors of the report., originally published in the journal Preventive Medicine before the World Health Organization＊s latest global estimates, modelled the health effects of active travel and of air pollution. They measured air quality through average annual levels of PM2.5s, the tiny pollutant particles that can embed themselves deep in the lungs. This type of air pollution can occur naturally 每 from dust storms or forest fires, for example 每 but is mainly created by motor vehicles and manufacturing.Breathing polluted air has been linked to infections including pneumonia, ischemic heart disease, stroke and some cancers. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation＊s  study ranks it among the top risk factors for loss of health.The  assumed cyclists moved at speeds of 12/14kph, with health benefits calculated in a similar way to the WHO＊s . It also assumed cyclists used roads with double the background levels of air pollution, which may underestimate how poor air quality is in many developing world cities: for example, a study in Lagos found  Delhi＊s annual PM2.5 concentration. People commuting to work along busy roads in a city with average annual background PM2.5 levels of 160 micrograms per cubic metre (米g/m) or above will pass the breakeven point at just 30 minutes a day, the study found. Using the , published in May, those levels are only reached in Zabor, and in Allahabad and Gwalior in India 每 although many large cities in the developing world do not accurately measure air pollution so were not included in the WHO database.Fifteen cities (see map above and table below) have annual mean PM2.5 levels of 115米g/m or above, according to the WHO data, so the breakeven point is reached after an hour of active travel. Fine particulate levels above 80米g/m were found in 62 cities, making cycling more harmful than beneficial after two hours.The study found people in western cities such as London, Paris or New York would never reach the point where PM2.5 air pollution＊s negatives outweigh exercise＊s positives in the long term.※The benefits of active travel outweighed the harm from air pollution in all but the most extreme air pollution concentrations,§ said Nazelle. ※It is not currently an issue for healthy adults in Europe in general.§London＊s annual average PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 15米g/m by the WHO 每 above the WHO＊s guideline of 10, but still at a level at which the study estimated active travel would always be beneficial. Paris had ambient PM2.5 levels of 18米g/m, while New York had 9米g/m.However, the study did not consider the health impacts of short-term spikes in PM2.5 pollution, or take into account the effect of exercising in air containing larger PM10 particulates, ozone, or toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel cars.London mayor  last month when air in the UK capital hit the maximum score of 10 on the Air Quality Index, equivalent to PM10 in excess of 101米g/m.

"He said he was doing it for Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh replied: stop polluting our city＊s good name.In withdrawing from the Paris climate accord Thursday,  explained that he was striking a blow on behalf of American manufacturers such as US Steel, the company that once made Pittsburgh a global industrial capital.※I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,§ the president explained.To hear Pittsburghers tell it, the president might as well have been talking about Pluto.※As you can imagine, we are extremely disappointed,§ said Michelle Naccarati-Chapkis, CEO of Women for a Healthy Environment, a locally based not-for-profit organization. There was a time 每 30, 40 years ago 每 when Pittsburgh was synonymous with the country＊s biggest industrial interests and home to their worst ills. Ringed by the smokestacks of US steel, the city once choked on its own air and wanted for the kinds of regulations the Paris accord phases in worldwide. ※Back in the day we were known as ＆hell with the lid off＊, and we had air pollution that impacted the entire region,§ said Naccarati-Chapkis. ※But this is a region that＊s thriving and growing, and to depict it by its antiquated industrial past is really not a true reflection of what＊s happening.§However, since the steel mills mostly shut down in the 1980s, the city has been reinvented as a center for medical research, technology companies, healthcare 每 and environmental innovation.Trump may have depicted a Pittsburgh whose past industrial glory is being choked by over-regulation. But the real story, people who live there say, is that environmental conservation has gone a long way toward freeing Pittsburgh from its industrial past. Vivien Li, president and CEO of Riverlife, a local nonprofit, said she welcomed Trump＊s having brought up her city in a speech sure to be watched closely by environmentally-minded citizens around the world. ※I think hearing Pittsburgh mentioned in the environmental context on the international stage really gives us the opportunity to remind people that the 21st-century Pittsburgh is very different from the industrial image that we had throughout the last century,§ Li said. ※Right now everyone wants to live by, work by, and play on the city＊s three rivers, whereas 20 years ago they were seen as a little bit too dirty, maybe a little dangerous, and without the amenities there today.§The quickest Pittsburgher to upbraid the president after his speech on Thursday was the city mayor himself, Bill Peduto, a Democrat. Peduto pointed out that while Trump may claim to represent Pittsburgh, the city did not want him to be president.※Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world and will follow Paris agreement,§ Peduto tweeted. ※As the mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris agreement for our people, our economy and future.§On Friday, Peduto issued an executive order committing Pittsburgh to the Paris climate accords, joining a movement that in only 24 hours swept up hundreds of municipalities, states and businesses. The movement, led by the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, counted 82 so-called ※climate mayors§ representing 39 million Americans, it said.The true story of Pittsburgh, activists said,was visible in employment numbers and municipal planning. The city has 13,000 employed locally in renewable energy, according to the city, versus 5,300 in iron and steel manufacturing. The city has its  to reduce greenhouse gas production by 20% below 2003 levels by 2023. The plan wasn＊t drafted to respond to Trump; Pittsburgh drafted its first  in 2008.

"We need conservation (not just fighting the illegal wildlife trade which has captured the limelight more recently) to be far higher up the political agenda. For example, we in the UK could be much more effectively linking overseas aid (budget of ?12bn this year) to poverty relief, sustainable development  environmental protection, ecosystem services and conservation priorities.  With human-elephant conflict it＊s also essential that the impact on people is recognised. Human lives are being lost (which is particularly extreme in India, but on the rise in Africa too), and there is extensive damage to crops and property. Solutions have to be found to help both people and elephants. It is vital that the communities＊ voices be heard, especially those individuals that live in the elephant range, and and are in conflict with the elephants on a daily basis. We have worked on mapping ※conflict§ in the district we work in. It is absolutely vital that we can prioritise the area most badly affected and ask the simple question to the community: What do you think is the way forward? What mitigation tool will be useful? If the community doesn＊t support a mitigation tool it will likely fail. For us it＊s vital that elephants and all wildlife are seen as valuable, either to an individual or an entire economy, where some country＊s tourism industry depends on this wildlife. But this value must come from the animal being alive and in good welfare condition 每 not exploited for entertainment or killed for its parts. Land use planning is key, but we should be looking at this with vision of coexistence 每 how elephants and people can share space. Also, land use planning needs to be combined in a holistic approach, including mitigation at the landscape level and addressing the needs of the people (improving food security and increasing benefits from living with elephants). We have been working with partners 每 both government and communities 每 in Botswana to do this through a participatory approach. We now have 13 corridors for elephants included in land use plans as well as areas of land identified for agricultural development which could be protected as cluster field areas from elephants. Human population growth is a reality that conservationists must reckon with. Africa＊s human population is expected to nearly double by the year 2050, from 1.2 billion people today to an estimated 2.4 billion people in 35 years. More people will mean increased pressures on land and resources. There will be less space available for all species and not just elephants. Conservationists must think clearly about this challenge and discuss openly how to manage elephants in human dominated landscapes. Not only are our elephants having their natural movement corridors cut by infrastructure developments like highways and railways (both of which are desperately needed for the Kenya＊s development), but we are also seeing significant increase in the farmer-elephant conflict. At Save The Elephants we＊re working closely with the Kenya Wildlife Service to monitor the impact of these development projects to identify areas for corridor protection through radio tracking and collaring of key elephants. We＊re also testing the use of  to reduce this particular level of conflict for the farms on the direct line of conflict to help reduce crop raid events and limit the line of encroachment of the farms into the corridors. We just published another data set from Tsavo showing the beehive fences were 80% effective at keeping elephants out of small 1-2 acre farms. Not 100% yet, but the farmers at least get some compensation from the honey sales and pollination services of the bees. We have investigated human fatal incidents due to elephants in the tea growing region, in the Anamalai hills. This is the main reason for people getting angry at elephants. Most of the fatalities occurred when people were unaware of the elephants and their movements. With the involvement of our government, corporate companies and local people, we have developed a range of early warning systems. These include sending out elephant location alerts over SMS and automated calls to mobile phones, automated announcement systems in public transport, and mobile-operated red beacons in strategic locations. These warning systems help people to plan their outdoor activities in order to avoid encounters with elephants. We did some experiments with chilli ropes in eastern India, and they worked. However, we have to yet to see large scale replication. We have been urging the government to promote this cheap mitigation measure. We also did experiments with irregular flashing LED lights that use very little battery power. And we had spectacular success with those. The elephants come up close to the crop fields every night but since the lights they haven＊t entered. In Kaziranga, the Corbett Foundation has been adopting different strategies at different locations for human-elephant conflictmitigation. The villages which fall under corridor need emphasis on effective guarding and the sites where elephants just venture to raid crops need solar powered fences which we have established jointly with the forest department in Assam. But in both the cases community has been included in every step of deliberation and action. "																																																			
																																																			
"ase files and laminated photos of poachers spill out of captain Than Naing＊s folder. As the chief of police in Okekan township, one of Myanmar＊s recent poaching hotspots, he is trying to track down the men who have killed at least three elephants in the area over the past year. So far, he has arrested 11 people suspected of having assisted the poachers. Meanwhile the poachers themselves remain at large.※These are the two men who we believe killed one of the elephants,§ he says, pointing to two photos. ※They are still on the run.§Reported cases of killed elephants in Myanmar have increased dramatically since 2010, with a total of 112 wild elephant deaths, most of them in the past few years. In 2015 alone, 36 wild elephants were killed, according to official figures from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation and the Wildlife  Society (WCS). The figures for 2016 are feared to be even worse.Neighbouring China is the main destination for elephant products. Despite the ivory ban imposed by the Chinese government earlier this year, ivory is still the most valuable part of the elephant. But worryingly conservationists are now seeing a growing demand for other parts of the animal; trunks, feet, even the penis, to be used in traditional medicine. The hide or skin, which is believed to be a remedy for eczema, is particularly in demand. Most elephants are killed in Pathein and Ngapudaw townships in Irrawaddy division 每 which is a major habitat for wild elephants 每 but recent killings have also been reported on both sides of the Bago mountain range in central , as well as in Mandalay division.In November, villagers in Okekan township discovered an elephant that had been skinned and mutilated, and alerted the authorities. ※It was found on the outskirts of Chaung Sauk village, drifting in a creek,§ says Kyaw Hlaing Win, the village tract administrator, who believes there are a lot more elephants killed than what is reported. ※We＊ve had at least nine or 10 elephants killed in the past few years here.§The hunters shoot elephants with arrows dipped in poison, and then follow the animal around as it meets its slow and agonising death, before skinning it and hacking off the saleable parts.The poachers operate in small gangs, often persuading local villagers to work as their guides or helpers.※Many gangs are coming from central Myanmar. Some include people from the ethnic Chin minority; they are good hunters,§ says Saw Htoo Tha Po, senior technical coordinator at WCS . ※They will make contact with the local villagers who know where the elephants roam, and either hire or pressure the villagers to work together with them.§So far this year, at least  stripped of their skin, the World Wildlife Fund told AFP.※Previously they would be hunted for their tusks, but as the male elephant population decreases the poachers will now kill any elephant they can find and sell other parts: the skin, the trunk, the feet or the penis, all of which is in demand in the Chinese market,§ says Saw Htoo Tha Po. ※The meat under the foot is supposed to be especially tasty, and the other products are consumed for their perceived medicinal qualities.§There is little data on Myanmar＊s wildlife trade, and no reliable figures on how much poachers are paid. But a visit to the tourist-oriented Bogyoke Market in Yangon, Myanmar＊s largest city, gives a hint of how lucrative the trade can be. While many vendors display fake ivory bracelets, a couple of shops off the main market lane offer real ivory trinkets and jewellery, as well as elephant teeth. One vendor sold elephant teeth for between US$140 and $250 per tooth, depending on the size. No doubt an inflated figure pre-haggle given to a perusing tourist, but nevertheless an indicator of the potentially large market value.Research from the University of Yangon shows that even at wholesale prices, an ivory bangle can sell for more than $100, while a necklace of beads can cost up to $150. In local markets for medicinal use, elephant skin retails for 150,000 kyat (about $120) per kg, and teeth sell for about 200,000 kyat/kg.In an attempt to tackle the rise in poaching, the forestry department alongside the WCS has developed the Myanmar Elephant Conservation Action Plan (Mecap), which outlines 10-year priorities to protect elephants, including finding meaningful work for elephants that were previously employed in the timber industry. Legal reforms are also intended to bring Myanmar＊s laws in line with international commitments like the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites).However, the legislative process can be grindingly slow in Myanmar, and conservationists worry poaching is spiralling out of control.※The forestry department can only efficiently patrol the protected areas, but most of the poaching is done outside of those areas,§ says Saw Htoo Tha Po at WCS. ※In these areas there is just not enough resources. They have a forest ranger and some office staff, but they alone cannot face off the poachers. They need more people and also reliable police to help them.§Once an elephant is killed and has had its valuable parts cut off, the poachers will pass the products to the first in a series of brokers, who will take one of several routes to cross Myanmar＊s long border with China and Thailand. The main trafficking route for wildlife trade goes from Mandalay through Lashio and across into China from Muse. Further south, there are at least four border crossings into Thailand used by wildlife smugglers.※There are many crossings with little enforcement,§ says Dr Alex Diment, technical adviser to the wildlife trafficking team at WCS. ※Even the Yangon and Mandalay international airports are easy targets for people taking small pieces of ivory to China.§Wildlife products destined for the Chinese market are also smuggled to the border town of Mong La where everything from elephant tusks to pangolin scales is for sale. Investigations by wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic, the World  Fund and Oxford Brookes University have found evidence that rhinoceros horns are being openly sold in Mong La.※There is a strong likelihood that rhino horn and other wildlife products are coming across by land from India, through Myanmar, on their way to China,§ says Diment.Recently, a  at Hanoi＊s Noi Bai airport with 3kg of rhino horn. The arrest is the first solid evidence of African wildlife trafficking through Myanmar. Elephants are endangered across Asia, with about 40,000 to 50,000 remaining in 2003, down from more than 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, according to the IUCN red list (which holds official information on threatened species worldwide). After India, Myanmar has the largest population of the Asian elephant, with as few as 1,400 wild elephants and 6,000 domesticated timber elephants.Since the Myanmar government halted logging operations to stop deforestation in 2014, the timber elephants have also become .As China moves to implement an ivory ban by the end of this year, conservationists worry how border markets such as Mong La will be affected.※We have already seen rapid growth of ivory available for sale in border markets, such as Mong La on the Myanmar-China border,§ says Chris R. Shepherd, Regional Director for TRAFFIC in Southeast Asia. ※It is likely that if enforcement on the Myanmar-China border at Mong La remains weak, this market will continue to flourish.§"																																																			
																																																			
"ou never see ＆air pollution＊ written as the cause on death certificates,§ an expert once told me. If it was, she suggested, the enormous toll toxic air takes on the health of billions of the world＊s people would prompt a global emergency response.But the winds of change are now blasting the air pollution crisis to greater prominence 每 driven by new data, revelations about the impact of poisonous air on virtually all aspects of health and, crucially, the increasing anger of affected people and communities.There is no doubt that air pollution is a global crisis: it . That is double the number of people lost to HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria combined, and four times the number killed on the world＊s roads. In Africa, air pollution kills .

"Five west African countries have announced measures to end the practice of European oil companies and traders exporting ※African quality§ diesel 每 highly polluting fuels that could never be sold in Europe.Swiss commodity traders were accused in a  of exporting fuels to west Africa with sulphur levels that are sometimes hundreds of times higher than European levels.The report accused oil companies of ※regulatory arbitrage§, allowing traders and companies to exploit weak standards to export cheap, dirty fuels in a process that Public Eye said was maximising profits at the expense of African＊s health. High-sulphur fuels are major contributors to respiratory diseases such as bronchitis and asthma. Last week Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Ivory Coast agreed to ban imports of high-sulphur diesel fuels as part of an initiative organised by the UN Environment Programme. Permitted levels of sulphur in imported diesel will fall from as high as  in some of the countries to 50 ppm. In Europe the maximum has been 10 ppm since 2009.There is nothing illegal about the practice exposed by Public Eye＊s report, and the blending of fuels to achieve particular specifications before export is standard industry practice. Companies identified in the report said they comply with the fuel standards imposed by the governments they ship to, and support efforts, including those by the African Refiners Association, to improve fuel standards.Erik Solheim, the head of UN Environment, said: ※West  is sending a strong message that it is no longer accepting dirty fuels from Europe. Their decision to set strict new standards for cleaner, safer fuels and advanced vehicle emission standards shows they are placing the health of their people first.§He said the decision set an example for others to follow, adding: ※Air pollution is killing millions of people every year, and we need to ensure that all countries urgently introduce cleaner fuels and vehicles to help reduce the shocking statistics.§ Nigeria＊s environment minister, Amina Mohammed, said the decision would lead to major improvements in air quality. ※For 20 years  has not been able to address the vehicle pollution crisis due to the poor fuels we have been importing. Today we are taking a huge leap forward ＃ this will result in major air quality benefits in our cities and will allow us to set modern vehicle standards.§The five countries also agreed to upgrade their national refineries to bring locally produced diesel up to the same quality by 2020.Oliver Classen, spokesman for Public Eye, said the decision to raise fuel standards following the report and campaign was encouraging. ※The improvement of air quality in African cities and the protection of people＊s health is possible. It needs neither rocket science, countless measures, or lengthy negotiations. But governments need to act and the time to act is now,§ he said.He called on the government of Switzerland, where most of the major commodity trading companies are headquartered, to impose ※mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence standards§, adding: ※It should cover the entire supply chain and including potentially damaging products.§Many of the fuel exports revealed by Public Eye are shipped from Dutch ports, and the decision was praised by the Dutch foreign trade and development cooperation minister, . ※The recent report from the NGO Public Eye made abundantly clear that coordinated action is needed to stop the practice of exporting dirty fuels to west Africa,§ said Ploumen. ※I am very pleased west African governments quickly decided to introduce standards that will help accessing European standard quality fuels. Their people deserve cleaner air, better health and a cleaner environment.§"																																																			
"The Coalition government has recommitted to Australia＊s emissions targets in the Paris agreement after Donald Trump＊s withdrawal but  faces internal division as conservative MPs celebrated the American decision.The energy and environment minister, , said he was disappointed with Trump＊s decision but reiterated the Turnbull government＊s full commitment to the Paris deal.※We reiterate our full commitment to the Paris Accord,§ Frydenberg told the ABC. ※We believe that the targets we agreed to, the 26% to 28% reduction in emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels are reasonable, are achievable. ※I do believe that it is still a very meaningful agreement. You have more than 190 countries that signed on, and in record time, 146 countries have ratified. So even without the US, around 70% of the world＊s emissions are covered by that agreement.§But the decision increases pressure on Turnbull ahead of the chief scientist Alan Finkel＊s report which will be released at the council of Australian governments (Coag) meeting next Friday.Former Abbott government minister Eric Abetz has suggested a potential Australian withdrawal on the grounds climate policy could increase the cost of electricity and transport in Australia.※I have long said that should countries like the United States, China or India withdraw their support or fail to live up to the non-binding targets, Australia should similarly pull back to allow for an increased focus on supporting families and jobs in Australia,§ Abetz said. ※While I will be interested in reading the  when it＊s complete, because we must make our own policy decisions for our own reasons, the reasoning behind president Trump＊s decision may similarly apply in the Australian context.§Abetz said at the very least the Finkel review should be delayed to consider the consequences of the US decision.※I don＊t think anybody would be critical in the event that report was delayed so, as part of the review, there could be full consideration as to what the consequences might be for Australia,§ he told AAP on Friday.But Turnbull, speaking in Singapore ahead of bilateral meetings, ruled out delaying the Finkel review, as it was commissioned by Coag. He said while he was disappointed by Trump＊s decision, it was entirely expected.※The [Paris] commitments that we made, are in Australia＊s interest,§ Turnbull said. ※We are committed to ensuring that Australians have affordable and reliable energy and that we meet our emission reduction targets. ※There is a massive national and global interest in achieving that and maintaining energy, but you cannot be ideological about it. You have to be hard-headed.Turnbull said the government＊s decisions would be driven by economics and engineering.※The momentum towards a lower emissions energy sector is irresistible. It is driven in large part by technology,§ he said.Liberal MP and chair of the backbench environment committee, Craig Kelly, who was at the  which forced Frydenberg to rule out any form of carbon trading, had ※champagne on ice§ waiting for the US withdrawal. Early on Friday morning, he posted ※THEY＊RE OUT§ on his Facebook page and  with a video of Whitney Houston singing the Star Spangled Banner.※There is a more efficient way to generate energy than using fossil fuels, it＊s just that mankind hasn＊t yet worked it out,§ Kelly said.※But if our history tells us anything, we are more likely to discover that new technology by combining free market capitalism with the wealth created by fossil fuels than we are through central planning and government imposed regulations that destroy wealth.§With Turnbull in Singapore for bilateral annual leaders talks, Frydenberg said it was important to have the United States in the agreement as the second largest emitter. But he insisted the Paris Agreement remained meaningful.Asked about Trump＊s previous comments that , Frydenberg said there was broad global understanding about the significance of climate change.Frydenberg praised the US economy for having its lowest emissions intensity in more than two decades partly due to gas exploration.※It＊s got its lowest emissions intensity in more than 20 years and one of the reasons for that is the shale gas revolution which has seen gas overtake coal as a major energy source,§ he said.※But here in Australia, we＊re at the lowest emissions intensity on a GDP and per capita basis in 27 years. So Australia is transforming and we are supporting that transition in a way that ensures energy affordability and energy security.§The government has already ruled out any form of carbon trading to appease more conservative MPs in the Coalition party room even though  will recommend a version of emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector as one of the more preferable options. Finkel gave support to such a scheme in his .Frydenberg doubled down against any form of emissions intensity scheme following Trump＊s decision but predicted there would be  this week ahead of Trump＊s decision.※It would push out, faster than the system can cope, brown and black coal generators and right now, after we saw the blackout in South Australia, which was a disaster for the people and the businesses of that state, we can＊t afford to compromise energy security and energy affordability,§ Frydenberg said.※That＊s why it＊s a dilemma that we face.§Senior Labor frontbencher Penny Wong said it was a deep disappointment that the US withdrew from the agreement which represented the most significant global action to deal with climate change.Wong noted China had continued to express its support for the Paris Agreement overnight but said any agreement needs the United States.※The United States is a global leader; whatever it does, matters,§ Wong said. She called on the prime minister to be absolutely clear with the US administration to continue to press Donald Trump on climate change. Wong said she was disappointed to see members of the  publicly advocating for the US withdraw.Kelly told Guardian Australia that while he celebrated the US decision, he did not believe Australia should withdraw from the agreement yet but should monitor its effects on the economy.He said for the US, the Paris Agreement gave China a huge advantage over the US.※After those negotiations China would have walked away from table laughing at the US because they can increase their emissions to their heart＊s content,§ Kelly said. He said his concern was Australian would also be giving up its international competitive advantage of cheaper energy costs.※Look at the Renewable Energy Target, we have simply spent a lot of money with not a lot of result,§ Kelly said.He said Australia needed affordable and reliable electricity supplies and ※at moment we are getting neither§ and the country was simply exporting jobs to China."																																																			
"The owner of Britain＊s energy network is gearing up to buy more power from suppliers to ensure the country＊s lights stay on, with polluting diesel generators among the providers vying for contracts.The  needs back-up electricity sources that kick in when, for instance, demand is high but the weather is not breezy enough to power wind farms. It secures this back-up power through the annual capacity market auction that begins on Tuesday and will see controversial ※diesel farms§ taking part.This auction process has created  for people to invest in diesel farms, rows of noisy and polluting generators that operate for up to 15 years. In fact, financiers have set up companies specifically to access payments from the National Grid. And while the government is weighing up  of such investments, many diesel farms have been built and are already . Still more could land multimillion-pound contracts this week.Industry sources said one farm can easily make ?5m a year, while non-profit climate analysis firm InfluenceMap today claims the  in a matter of years. In some cases, investors are also eligible for generous tax breaks. Gas has become an increasingly important part of the UK＊s energy mix as coal, due to be phased out by 2025, has been scaled back. Diesel farms are not there to provide power on a routine basis, but to fire up at times of peak use or to help balance second-by-second changes in demand.While the farms offer a profitable investment, those who live nearby say their lives are blighted by noise pollution and fear of toxic emissions. In Ernesettle, Plymouth, locals told the Guardian they are fed up with .One of the two diesel farms in Ernesettle is owned by Rockpool Investments, founded by City financier Nicola Horlick. Each of Rockpool＊s nine diesel farms has more than 100 investors putting in a combined ?34m, according to documents seen by the Guardian. But for Ernesettle residents, the reality is intolerable noise pollution and a growing fear of harmful nitrogen oxide emissions.※It＊s like a bloody jet engine in my garden,§ said Flo Vickery.Vickery was among hundreds employed at the Toshiba factory that once stood on the site the diesel farms now occupy. She has kept a diary of the noise they give off and says that in winter they often run for two hours an evening, several days a week.Neighbour Chris Kelland said: ※When the wind blows I have to shut the window because it＊s just a continuous drone. It＊s a big air polluter too. Why don＊t they put it in their own back yard?§Plutus PowerGen, which operates and part owns Rockpool＊s plants, said it only uses Green D+ diesel, which boasts lower emissions. The company acknowledged there may be some noise pollution, but said its plants only run for up to 200 hours a year, meaning noise is ※limited§.However, the plants typically run only in winter, meaning noise from the generators could affect residents for at least an hour each day for four months. One reason Rockpool is so keen on diesel farms is that any set up before November 2015 are eligible for a tax break through the .The scheme offers an income tax cut worth 30% of the investment, as well as reductions in Capital Gains Tax.Stock market filings show that Rockpool set up nine power plant firms in time to beat a policy change that prevents new power plants from accessing the EIS tax break. Even without tax relief, diesel plants can deliver high returns.Through the annual capacity market auction, companies can bid for 15-year contracts to provide power at short notice. The Grid said it did not know how many contracts have been awarded to plants that run on diesel.But the rewards on offer mean Rockpool is just one of several major diesel investors. One such firm is Peak Gen Power, which applied to build 15 plants in the upcoming 2016 auction after succeeding with 13 bids last year.It refused to say what fuel it will use but planning applications show that it has repeatedly sought permission for diesel-fuelled plants. Accounts registered at Companies House show the majority owner of Peak Gen Power is Dione Holdings, registered in the British Virgin Islands. The company declined to comment on the offshore structure.While Rockpool and Peak Gen Power declined to comment, Oliver Hughes of Oxford Capital Partners 每 a diesel farm investor 每 said: ※From our perspective, there＊s an ever-increasing reliance on intermittent generation from renewables. One solution is to run a large coal fired power plant. The alternatives [to diesel farms] are potentially a lot more ugly.§But energy experts dispute the suggestion that diesel is a necessary part of the transition to a low carbon future.※Cleaner and cheaper options that the government should be prioritising include demand response, where non-essential demand is turned off for a little while, battery storage and CHP (combined heat and power) generation,§ said Richard Black, director of the  & Climate Intelligence Unit. ※All of those are natural components of the low-carbon power system that Britain needs to build over the next 15 years, whereas diesel is not.§There are moves under way in government to change the policies that make diesel farms such an attractive investment.  has said that payments to small power plants appear too high. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy recently proposed limiting these payments and has also considered slashing payouts to firms that are also in receipt of tax relief.Rockpool Investments has fought policy change hard, according to a document obtained by InfluenceMap and shared with the Guardian. The document warns that retrospectively limiting the financial benefits available to the companies Rockpool owns would have a ※devastating effect§ on them.But rival UK Power Reserve thinks the double whammy of subsidies and tax relief could be illegal under EU state aid rules.※We believe any tax relief funded projects should be completely excluded from the capacity market and we won＊t rest until that happens,§ said chief executive Tim Emrich.He said: ※UK Power Reserve is considering its legal options in relation to state-aid non-compliance,§ adding that BEIS＊s proposed reforms ※do not go far enough§.Diesel farms face a second threat, with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulting on measures to limit diesel emissions. This would make it harder for them to comply with environmental regulations, forcing them to spend money on pollution abatement technology or switch to a more expensive but cleaner fuel.Defra acknowledged in its consultation that ※potential distortions in the wider policy landscape§ have given diesel an ※unfair advantage§. Impending policy change is beginning to have an effect, with several diesel companies understood to have pulled out of the running for the capacity market auction.But changes to the way the Grid pays  are not expected to apply to those that secured consent in previous auctions. That means communities like Ernesettle have little to gain and local councillor Mark Lowry has been left scratching his head.※It＊s so easy to make money from this, it＊s ridiculous,§ he said. ※Find some land, put a few diesel generators on it, get a massive tax subsidy. It＊s so illogical.§"																																																			
" may claim to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, but the mayor of the Steel City said he supports Paris.Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, fired back after Trump referenced the city in his speech defending the White House＊s decision to withdraw the US from the  climate accord.※I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,§ Trump said, speaking in the White House rose garden on Thursday.Peduto seized on the comment, countering that Pittsburgh voted for Trump＊s opponent, Hillary Clinton, during the 2016 presidential election. ※Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh,§ he . ※Pittsburgh stands with the world and will follow Paris agreement.§He continued: ※As the mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris agreement for our people, our economy and future.§The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, an outspoken critic of Trump, chimed in. ※Once again Donald Trump is wrong,§ Hidalgo said on Twitter. ※Paris and Pittsburgh do stand together for the Paris agreement.§During his remarks, Trump also referenced Youngstown, Ohio, and Detroit, Michigan, as examples of cities that would benefit from America＊s departure from the Paris accord. Like Pittsburgh, both cities are located in counties that Clinton won easily.Peduto is one of several US mayors who have committed to enforce the tenets of the climate accord, despite Trump＊s decision to join Nicaragua and Syria as the only countries not party to the agreement.In a statement, the US Conference of Mayors said that it strongly opposes leaving the Paris agreement, and called on the nation＊s mayors to continuing fighting climate change by committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.※The US Conference of Mayors is a strong proponent of the need to address climate change and we support the Paris agreement, which positions the world＊s nations, including the United States, to be energy independent, self-reliant, and resilient,§ Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton, chair of the conference＊s environment committee, said in a statement.※A thriving economy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are compatible by focusing on new technology, investing in renewable fuel sources, and increasing our energy efficiency.§Barack Obama, whose administration spent years painstakingly negotiating the terms of the , said leaving the accord is an abdication of US leadership on the global stage.

"On Monday I stood on Vauxhall Bridge counting cyclists. Sad but true. I did the same thing  following a startling radio station row about how many people were using the newly-opened, two-way cycle superhighway, CS5, to cross the bridge and how many weren＊t bothering. My return last week was in order to see what might have changed in the ensuing 12 months. Was CS5 being used more or less? Had the overall number of cyclists crossing the bridge increased or reduced? Were cyclists behaving differently?The  is on the eastern side of the bridge. During the first bitterly cold half hour I spent on the bridge on a Tuesday morning last November, I counted 98 cyclists - a rate of  - crossing the bridge on its western side. Almost all were heading north into central London, as you would expect during the morning peak travel period, and made their way through the motorised traffic into the bus lane. During that half hour, hardly any cyclists took advantage of the signalised crossing provided for them on the southern approach to the bridge to get over to CS5 and make use of that bespoke facility for crossing the bridge.For the next bitterly cold half hour, still in the morning peak, I counted the cyclists who  use CS5. There were 265 of them - a rate of  - again, almost all heading north. This was less than might have been expected in view of a  issued near that time which said that ※in the busiest peak more than 750 cyclists are already using the new dedicated segregated lane§, a number supplied by no less an authority than Boris Johnson＊s cycling commissioner Andrew Gilligan. Adding up the figures for cycle traffic on both sides of the road made a grand total of . So what about late November 2016? Again, the morning weather was cold, though not as cold as it had been the previous year. The first difference I notice was that the number of cyclists heading north who used the bus lane side of the bridge during my 30-minute count was much smaller - just 27, a rate of  compared with 196 per hour in late November 2015. But it quickly became apparent that something else had changed which could partly account for this. The number of cyclists approaching Vauxhall Bridge from the western, Wandsworth side who chose to used the signalised road crossing, make their way over to CS5 and cross the bridge using the segregated lane was much higher. In fact, exactly the same number chose to do that as chose not to - a very different picture from a year before, when almost none crossed the road at that point.I then made my way over to CS5 and conducted a half hour count there, again still during the morning peak. Between 07:45 and 08:15 I saw 380 cyclists, a rate of -a very substantial 230 more than had used it during my equivalent November 2015 count. Of these, the vast majority were heading north, though a significant 57 were heading south. Adding up the total number of cyclists on both sides of the road during the morning peak produced a grand total of - 88 more per hour than on a chillier morning a year before, with a larger proportion of them using CS5 and many more taking the time to cross the approach road to the bridge to make use of it. Late that afternoon, I returned to Vauxhall Bridge and again counted the cyclists using CS5. Between 17:20 and 17:50, which falls into the 16:30-18:30 busiest period for London road traffic at that end of the day, 349 cyclists went by - an hourly rate of  - considerably fewer than the 760 per hour that had used CS5 during the morning peak.I didn＊t count how many cyclists took the north-bound bus lane option on the other side of the bridge at that time because I had to be somewhere else but, assuming that at that end of day there would have been very few of them (remember, there were only 27 during my 30-minute the morning peak vigil), it means the total number of cyclists on Vauxhall Bridge during that period was a lower than it had been in the morning.That might seem odd - it seems reasonable to expect that cyclists heading towards the centre in the morning will commute back by the same route at the end of the day. But, in fact, a Transport for London (TfL) report on the performance of its cycling programmes, considered by its programmes and investment committee on Wednesday, confirms that the evening peak numbers using CS5 on Vauxhall Bridge are indeed lower than the morning peak ones, as they are on the CS routes along Victoria Embankment, and Blackfriars Bridge, according to initial counts (see ).The same paper says that the numbers of cyclists using the CS at those three locations have risen by 73% (Vauxhall Bridge), 54% (Victoria Embankment) and 55% (Blackfriars Bridge) compared with ※pre-construction figures§. My figures for Vauxhall Bridge should be viewed with circumspection - there would have to be a lot more counting over many more days than I could spare to get a really reliable numerical picture - but they at least indicate that numbers there have continued to go up  CS5 was opened too.How good is this news? An obvious yardstick is the policy objectives set out in Johnson＊s 2013 , which announced the CS programme and its goals. The third of its four ※key outcomes§ was:If my Vauxhall Bridge count reflects the true picture, then the total number of cyclists crossing the bridge - including those eschewing CS5 for doing so - has risen by at least 10% in the past year and is therefore on course to double after ten (though, of course, it will have to increase at the same rate everywhere else in the metropolis to live up to the Vision＊s assertion). What about the demographic spread the Vision aspires to? At present, young, white, male professionals  in London＊s , for a range of . Of course, my mini-survey couldn＊t ascertain what jobs the cyclists do. However, I can report that only about 30% were female, most looked pretty youthful and only a handful were not white, so there looks to still be some work to be done if cycling is to appeal to those groups of Londoners less inclined to take it up. Can this be achieved through infrastructure alone?That TfL report picks up some further issues too. It notes () an initial survey finding that cycle flows on CS5 as a whole ※are around 85% lower outside of the peak periods§. As the report also notes, this huge drop reflects the CS routes covering ※key commuter corridors§ and also ※cycle flows throughout central London§ but it raises the value-for-money question of how to increase their use during the heart of the London day. Then there is the matter of increased motorised road traffic congestion. The TfL report says () that on the CS5 route, inbound journey times for motor vehicles in the morning peak were 15-20 minutes long before the CS was constructed and that the range has narrowed to approximately 20 minutes, while journey times in the evening peak are now 15 minutes having been ※just less§ than that prior to the CS works beginning. TfL seem pleased with this, given that a lane for motor traffic has been removed, though the story not so happy eastbound in the evenings on the route of the east-west superhighway, where the report says journey times have risen between five and 15 minutes. The problem with long motor traffic delays it that they are bad for air quality - these may represent a perverse outcome for London, given that promoting cycling is integral to  to improve Londoners＊ health.The new mayor, Sadiq Khan, says he is  to making cycling safer and easier and has said he will learn lessons from mistakes he thinks his predecessor made. Me, I＊ve pencilled in a date to visit Vauxhall Bridge around this time next year. Still sad. Still true."																																																			
"His Royal Highness Emere Godwin Bebe Okpabi, the paramount ruler and hereditary king of the Ogale community in the oil-rich Niger delta, is ready to explode.After nearly a week of sittting quietly in top hat and regal chains in the obscure technology and construction court in London listening to Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, argue why 45,000 impoverished Ogalean farmers should not be allowed to sue the company in Britain for historical pollution, he says he feels ※betrayed and saddened ＃ I dispute everything they have said. To listen to Shell saying they have not been not responsible for the pollution in Ogale has been dreadful.§King Emere wants to sue Shell in London for not cleaning up pollution because he fears his community may never get justice in Nigeria. ※You can never, never defeat Shell in a Nigerian court. A case can go on for very many years. You can hardly get a judgment against [an oil company] in Nigeria. Shell is Nigeria and  is Shell.§The stakes are high, he says. If the London judge hearing the preliminary arguments finds for the king then, in around one year＊s time, Shell will have to defend itself in the British courts. The result could be a massive clean-up of Ogale, possibly millions of dollars＊ in damages and other polluted communities bringing their cases to Britain.The judge, who has nearly 1,000 pages of reports, submissions and statements from the two sides to consider will rule in the early new year. But if Shell wins, says the king, then the case will have to be heard in Nigeria where they may be able to avoid justice for decades because cases can get kicked between the appeal and supreme courts for many years.※We are desperate people looking for justice. We know we cannot get justice there. A community near us got a huge judgment against Shell but the appeals have taken 10 years so far. In one case it has taken a community 32 years so far to get justice.§Shell＊s lawyers respond that the Nigerian justice system has been reformed and speeded up and that its Nigerian subsidiary, SPDC, should be held responsible for any pollution rather than the parent company, Shell International. They claim that Ogale has also been heavily affected by theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining rather than failure of infrastructure.The king and and his legal team from a UK law firm, Leigh Day, argue that a precedent was set last year when  over water pollution by a subsidiary because the Zambian legal system was deeply flawed.That pollution has occurred in Ogale from old Shell and Nigerian oil company pipelines is not disputed. Official records say there have been more than 40 major spills in the small Ogale kingdom over the years, of which 23 have been since 2011.In 2011 the UN environment programme (Unep) published a scientific study of pollution in Ogoniland which said it found oil spills happening with ※alarming regularity§ in Ogale, including groundwater contamination that is more than 4,500 times Nigerian recommended levels. Water samples taken in 2010 from three metres below ground were found to be contaminated with benzene and other chemicals.King Emere offers a bottle of water taken recently, he says, from an Ogale borehole. The liquid smells powerfully of oil and tastes foul. ※This is what we must drink. It is getting worse. We are getting strange illnesses. Our boys and girls cannot have children. We have strange deaths,§ he says.But the king says he is most saddened because he has witnessed the complete breakdown of trust between the company and his community. ※I was a child of the 60s and 70s. We had a good relationship with the company. They would come with their Land Rovers. As little boys we would push them just to touch the Shell Land Rover. We used to go under the gas flare at the manifold to see the big beetles. We had no electricity. Our only lighting was the flare. We played there. When I was at primary school we used to run into the bush to get fruits, beautiful fruits. Now we have nothing.※We did not know about pollution then. There were a lot of spills. We would see them and think nothing of them. We never knew that Shell was planting a time-bomb. We gradually realised things were getting bad in the 1980s and 1990s.※Have we done well out of the partnership with Shell? No. They have dumped us. I got saddened as I sat in the court and watched them trying to create a distance between themselves and the consequences of pollution. I saw them trying to push the blame on to someone else.※The truth is that  has been responsible for the damage in my community. The same people we loved are killing us now.§"																																																			
"raven, cynical and corrupt: an alliteration that sums up Donald Trump＊s decision to pull the US out of the .He rebuffed the entreaties of everyone from Elon Musk to the pope. He ignored scientific evidence that already shows catastrophic beach erosion, cracking Arctic ice and flooding cities. Instead, he cast in with his climate change-denying EPA administrator, , and the barons of the world＊s dirtiest industries, coal and fossil fuels.It was a craven act because the US over time is the biggest contributor to the carbon dioxide that is poisoning the atmosphere and sizzling the planet. Given our culpability in creating an urgent worldwide environmental crisis, it was a moral duty to keep our commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 2C (3.6F). To walk away is supremely selfish.※In cumulative terms, we certainly own this problem more than anybody else does,§ David G Victor, a longtime scholar of climate politics at the University of California at San Diego told . ※Many argue that this obligates the United States to take ambitious action to slow global warming.§While moral arguments don＊t seem to matter to this president, geopolitical gamesmanship does. Trump＊s decision was self-defeating for the country and him. For someone so hellbent on being the big man on the world stage that he pushed the  out of the way so that he could be front and center in a photo, his decision radically shrinks American influence. He has handed a unique leadership role in curbing climate change to China, assuming it will remain in the accord. Already the Chinese leadership is licking its lips over Trump＊s nationalist retreat from anything perceived as globalism, particularly his bungled messaging on Nato at last week＊s G7 meeting in Brussels. He left Angela Merkel fuming that Europe could no longer count on the US to defend its interests. Look eastward, the Chinese say, beckoning Europe to look to its support, deals and friendship. The splintering of the post-second world war alliance, which ushered in an age of liberal democracy in the west, would be a tragedy beyond imagining. But Thursday＊s announcement abandoning the Paris accord is a dangerous step in that direction because it fuels the perception that no one can really depend on the US to keep its word.Already there was deep annoyance with the US when, after spending years negotiating a climate agreement with the Clinton administration, rich and poor counties were confronted by another turncoat president, George W Bush, who backed out of it. Now, less than a decade later, it is Trump doing the about-face on the long-fought climate agreement struck with Barack Obama. Why would other countries ever again trust the US to stick to an agreement on global warming or waste time negotiating one with the US again? Trump＊s pledge that the US will stick to the letter of the accord＊s withdrawal process, which would take more than four years, might also be forgotten.Justifying his reactionary positions on global warming with the myth of job creation is beyond cynical. In his remarks, Trump listed sectors of the US economy that would suffer lost revenues and jobs if the country remained part of the accord. But the only evidence he used is a study that has been roundly  by credible environmental experts. The dubious study claims the agreement would cost 2.7m jobs by 2025. The reality is quite the opposite, as Obama noted in his biting remarks about his successor＊s decision. ※The nations that remain in the Paris agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,§ he said in a .It is cynical and cruel to raise the hopes of out-of-work coal miners, claiming that by abandoning the accord he will bring back their jobs. Almost everyone else, besides the conservative coal barons who support him and were feted in the White House, and a few misguided politicians in the coal counties of Virginia, Tennessee and West Virginia, know those jobs are gone for good. Long ago, lopping off mountaintops and strip mining, which required machines instead of humans, erased good mining jobs. This was long before the Paris negotiators sat down for their first meeting in 2015.On Thursday, the Koch brothers and their allies in big oil must have been turning cartwheels of glee over their rigs. Americans for Prosperity, which is funded by the influential libertarian brothers Charles G and David H Koch, was one of the leaders of a coalition that urged exiting from the treaty. The groups also included ones bankrolled by the Mercer family, patrons of Steve Bannon, the White House aide who held the president＊s hands to the fire to keep his base-pleasing promise to trash the Paris accord.While the Kochs were initially cool to Trump as a candidate, his decision on the Paris accord will surely help cement their support and financial largesse for years to come and in 2020, if Trump survives and seeks re-election. This is precisely the kind of corrupt pay-to-play politics that Trump pledged to end by ※draining the swamp§.He will need the support. The political blowback is already huge. Former vice-president Al Gore, who was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for efforts to educate about global warming, called Trump＊s decision ※a reckless and indefensible action§. Former secretary of state John Kerry called the move an ※abdication§ of leadership and ※self-destructive§. Gore is touring the country in advance of the , an update on his blockbuster An Inconvenient Truth.Already, with his self-defeating immigration policies, Trump has turned a cold heart to much poorer nations. His decision to abandon the climate agreement that virtually every other country on Earth approved is even colder. One of the central tenets of the accord was that richer countries and the biggest polluters 每 the US and China 每 would help to fund the efforts to curb global warming by much smaller and poorer nations. Trump often invokes his young son, Barron, in his speeches. His terrible decision leaves his son＊s generation facing scorching environmental problems. For the father, this will indeed be an inconvenient truth."																																																			
"People who work on building infrastructure understand the risks of climate change. As the Earth warms, new stresses are applied to our buildings, bridges, roads, houses, and other structures. Some of the obvious threats to infrastructure are from extreme weather including heat waves, storms, and intense rainfalls. There are some other less obvious threats, and many of the threats vary by location. Regardless, the planning for infrastructure relies upon a reasonable estimation of future climate changes. To help quantify such an estimate for the civil engineering community,  was published by the  (I was fortunate to be a coauthor). The article was prepared with the collaboration of  from Penn State University and . The paper in question does not uncover new facts. We didn＊t discover past warming that wasn＊t known. We didn＊t create new predictions that were previously uncreated. Rather, we assembled available information to provide a solid basis that can be used for future plans involving infrastructure. The first thing we established was the long-term trend in the global temperature. While there are many groups around the world that collect global temperatures, two of the best known groups are NASA and NOAA. As shown in the data below, which I downloaded and graphed for the paper, temperatures have risen by about 1.4∼C (approximately 2.5∼F) from their low point circa 1900. Since scientists constantly argue against cherry picking; we used an average temperature over the 1880每1930 time period. Relative to that time, temperatures have risen about 1.2∼C (1.8∼F)I have long argued and certainly continue to believe, that the surface temperature trend is not the best way to quantify warming. If you really want to measure global warming,  where the vast majority of heat is being stored. As I have reported here before, the oceans are telling a similar story 每 climate change is certainly happening. However, since we are not building infrastructure deep in the oceans, its temperatures are not very relevant for the present discussion. What all this proves is that the Earth is warming. But civil engineers want to know what the Earth will be like in a decade, or two decades, or even longer. To predict that, you need other tools. You could make predictions based on the past temperature record of the planet or you could use computer simulations of the climate. But if you are going to use a simulation, you want to have some reassurance that the results are valid. So, the next thing we did in the paper was compare computer simulations of Earth＊s surface temperatures with measurements. The results are shown below. The figure shows four different data measurement sets and a range of model predictions (grey-shaded region). I＊ve highlighted the temperature of 2016 with a red star; it＊s slightly above the middle dashed line, which means it＊s slightly above the average prediction of the models but certainly within the grey range. As you all know, scientists don＊t really care whether one year is hot or another is cold; what we look at is the long-term trend. Clearly, the long-term trends are going up, whether you look at the measurements or the predictions. While it is too early to put the 2017 temperature into the graph, so far, it is almost exactly equal to the 2016 value. If that trend holds for the rest of the year, it will be another case where the models are running slightly too cold.We also showed in the paper that in other instances, the models are under-predicting change. For example, models are under-predicting changes to ocean heating (and to arctic ice loss). But, in general, they are doing a pretty good job.So, if we can trust the models, what do they tell us about the future? This is the question most civil engineers are interested in. In the paper, we showed that we expect the Earth to warm by about 4∼C more (7∼F) over the present temperature by the year 2100. This is near the upper end of the last IPCC reports. In the paper, we conclude that engineers know enough to begin to prepare. While people in the halls of Congress or in homes at holiday time may still argue about whether climate change is happening, scientists and engineers now have enough information to make informed decisions. In a certain sense, this latest paper reflects a growing collaboration between climate science and engineering. Climate scientists tell us what is happening to the planet. Engineers are helping us prepare."																																																			
"Governments around the world are increasingly being challenged in court to do more to combat the threat of climate change, with litigation ranging from a group＊s attempt to stop an airport runway in Austria to a Pakistani farmer suing his government over its failure to adapt to rising temperatures, a new study has found.The lion＊s share of the litigation is in the US, but the number of countries with such cases has tripled since 2014.UN Environment and Columbia law school, , found a ※proliferation§ of cases instigated by citizens and environmental groups demanding action on areas such as sea-level rise, coal-fired power plants and oil drilling.※It＊s patently clear we need more concrete action on climate change, including addressing the root causes and helping communities adapt to the consequences,§ said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. ※The science can stand up in a court of law, and governments need to make sure their responses to the problem do too.§The US has been the staging ground for 654 climate-related cases, almost three times that of the rest of the world combined. Some of these cases have proved pivotal, such as a 2007 case where various states and cities demanded the Environmental Protection Agency regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.The supreme court ruled against George W Bush＊s administration, leading to the EPA determining that greenhouse gases are a public health threat and opening the way for Barack Obama＊s executive action on climate change.Other cases are continuing, such as the 21 children who are represented in a lawsuit against the federal government, claiming that its failure to sufficiently cut emissions violates their constitutional right to life, liberty and property. The Sierra Club, an environmental group, said the case would ※upend climate law as we know it§ should it be successful.Australia, with 80 cases, and the UK, with 49 cases, are the next largest national sources of climate litigation, although the report notes that legal action is starting to emanate from all corners of the world. The issue of ※climate refugees§, where people have had to flee their country due to flood or drought, is gaining traction, following a case where a man from Kiribati sought refuge in New Zealand.In the Netherlands, an environmental group called the Urgenda Foundation joined with several hundred Dutch citizens to sue the government over its decision to lower its greenhouse gas reduction target. The court concluded the case had merit based on the Dutch constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and the ※no harm§ principle of international law.In a separate case, several groups managed to overturn the approval of a third runway at Vienna＊s main airport, while in yet another case, a court in Pakistan ruled in favor of Ashgar Leghari, a farmer, over his government＊s ※delay and lethargy§ in implementing its climate change adaption policies.Not all cases have been as successful. A Peruvian man sued a German energy company over the climate impacts suffered in his homeland, with the case ultimately dismissed. ※We haven＊t seen any major wins filed in actions against fossil fuel companies but there have been successes in lawsuits against governments,§ said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia. ※A lot of this legal action is in the US because America is a litigious society but also because there is such a partisan divide over the fundamental reality of climate change, which doesn＊t really exist elsewhere in the world.§Burger said legal action will prove significant in pushing the countries closer to their agreed target of avoiding global warming of 2C or more compared to the era shortly before the advent of heavy industry. The world is currently on course to breach this limit, causing ever more dangerous climate change, even with the emissions reduction pledges agreed in the Paris climate deal.※The role of litigation will be different in each country but we will continue to see an increase in climate lawsuits that make explicit reference to the Paris agreement,§ he said. ※In the US, I don＊t think that any court will hold the government to account over Paris as it＊s not binding, but other courts in other countries may give it different weight.※Legal action will be used to stave off the worst aspects of climate change. Litigation has been absolutely essential in instigating action in the US and elsewhere, and it will continue to be so.§"																																																			
"he verdict is in and the government is guilty. In a landmark ruling,  that the plans to cut fatal air pollution are not only inadequate, but also illegal. To anyone who has seen , the verdict is not surprising.※If there was a toxin in our water system that we knew was killing thousands of people every year, the government would be coordinating Cobra meetings every day,§ Matthew Pennycook, the Labour MP for Greenwich and chair of parliament＊s cross-party group on air pollution, said after this morning＊s ruling. But when it comes to the fatal toxins in our air, the government has not been coordinating any emergency meetings. It has been moving at a snail＊s pace.Air pollution is a known killer. The UK has been in breach of legal limits on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for years. The government＊s  show air pollution is causing 40-50,000 deaths every year, by exacerbating respiratory illnesses, heart disease and asthma. New evidence suggests it is not only finding its way into our lungs, but into our brains too, where it may . In the , we are facing a public health crisis. that she will fight the ※burning injustices§ that entrench social inequality and blight the life chances of children from working-class families. She says that many in Westminster ※don＊t know what it＊s like to live like this and need to be told that what the government does isn＊t a game§. But perhaps the prime minister is among them.Children know that air pollution is not a game because they are substantially more vulnerable to toxins in the air, which permanently stunt the development of their lungs.  are people from ethnic minority backgrounds, those living in areas of higher levels of deprivation, the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. In short, they are the most vulnerable people in our society.Yet still, the apathy persists. It has now been more than a year since the , when a major car manufacturer was revealed to have been covering up air pollution through . In the US, VW has agreed to pay $15.3bn to compensate consumers and mitigate some of the damage it has done to the environment. In the UK the government has failed to take legal action or compensate consumers 每 all while lobbying at an EU level to water down regulations that would encourage the car industry to change. Indeed, the only reason the government has an air quality plan at all is because the  18 months ago.So what now? Speaking at prime minister＊s questions today, May promised that the government did not ※doubt the importance of the issue§ and would look again at the proposals. She is right, it will 每 because it will have to. It now has one week to negotiate with the NGO ClientEarth, which emerged victorious from the high court this morning. It will be forced to scrap its current air quality plan, which called for clean air zones in just five cities, and backed the mayor＊s plans in London, but did not mandate change in major cities such as Manchester and industrial hot spots such as Port Talbot.Any new plan is likely to implement clean air zones in many more cities and  in many city centres. But the government should ensure local authorities have proper resources to implement the zones. It is also likely the government will have to redo the flawed modelling on which its current plans are based, which fail to properly take into account  between tests in the laboratory and tests on the road.But even this is likely to be inadequate. Road transport is the number one contributor to NO2 pollution and diesel is the main culprit. Yet we currently have a tax system that incentivises consumers to purchase diesel cars, which currently make up close to half of the nation＊s fleet.  suggests that for central London to become compliant, the proportion of diesel cars on the road would need to be as low as 5%. The sale of diesel cars must end and the government must reform a regulator .But the car industry does not have to be the villain in this story. May has the opportunity to make it the hero and deliver a boost to the government＊s shiny new industrial strategy to boot. Both Norway and the Netherlands understand this 每 they are  an emissions-free industry within the decade. China has  a boost to its hybrid industry and even Germany, the nation that invented the car, is now for a ban on petrol and diesel by 2030.Electrics, hybrids and hydrogen are the future of the global car industry. If the UK doesn＊t move fast by delivering the incentives and infrastructure required to clean it up, we will get left behind. If the prime minister realises this opportunity, perhaps then she might really start to play the game."																																																			
"The UN＊s deputy secretary general has accused President  of ※treading water§ over a decision on the future of the Paris climate change agreement, on which the fate of millions of people depend.Amina Mohammed told the Guardian she was hopeful the US would not renege on the deal signed last year, but that Trump appeared to be avoiding a public declaration after taking such a hard line during his campaign for the White House. Trump has previously described climate change as a hoax orchestrated by China. During his battle for the presidency against Hillary Clinton he vowed to ※cancel§ the historic agreement, which commits countries to ensuring that the average global temperature does not rise 2C above pre-industrial levels. Since being elected Trump, who is on a world tour starting with a visit to Saudi Arabia, has delayed announcing his administration＊s position, although it is widely believed he will be forced to make a statement at the G7 summit in Italy next weekend.Mohammed said: ※[The US] coming out of the agreement does put the track for the ambition of attaining the target in jeopardy and we have to claw that back and make sure that doesn＊t happen.§Under the Paris agreement＊s ※members determined contributions§ (MDCs), former president Barack Obama pledged to cut US carbon dioxide emissions by 26% by 2025, bringing it down to 28%.Mohammed, a former environment minister in the Nigerian government, said the White House, while generally sceptical of the detailed terms of the agreement, appeared divided over what steps to take.She said: ※As far as the US administration＊s discussions are concerned, on the one hand there is the case of staying in the agreement and determining how they would respond to the MDCs and the commitments of the previous administration. They would rather be at the table than not.※On the other hand, there is the other side that says even if you stay in the agreement there is no room for manoeuvre. Those two positions are being worked out. We continue to talk to both sides about the imperative to stay and give the opportunity to go through the MDCs and work together with them on that.※I think he is treading water until he has to say something, probably at the G7 meeting. Maybe he will find a reason why he is not ready then either. What we have seen is there is an understanding in his administration that withdrawing from the agreement is not the best and they would probably be better served to stay in.§Obama hailed last year＊s  as a historic ※turning point§ in the fight against climate change, should countries fully commit to cutting emissions.However, Trump has already started stripping away many of the pollution rules imposed by Obama＊s administration, such as , , clean water regulations and curbs on toxic discharge from power plants.Mohammed said the president needed to be persuaded that while jobs might be lost in the coal industry, they would be regained in renewables if the US stuck to its promises.She said: ※The world has recognised that climate change is very real, the science shows emissions are having a detrimental effect and will be catastrophic unless we try to reduce them below two degrees and certainly 1.5. And so, the US being one of top emitters it is essential to have them in the agreement.※Globally, the implications are huge for countries that will go under water, coastlines that will lose investment to high-level sea rises. This is very real. I see hope for the US staying in the agreement. I think there is a bigger challenge of us keeping the ambition of the MDCs.§"																																																			
"Drivers of polluting diesel vehicles could soon be charged to enter many city centres across Britain, after the government accepted in the high court on Wednesday that its current plans to tackle the nation＊s air pollution crisis were so poor they broke the law.The humiliating legal defeat is the second in 18 months and ends years of inadequate action and delays to tackle the problem which causes 50,000 early deaths every year.Ministers are now bound to implement new measures to cut toxic air quickly and the prime minister, Theresa May, indicated the government would this time respond positively: ※There is more to do and we will do it.§The most likely measure is using charges to deter polluting diesel vehicles from ※clean air zones§ in urban centres, which could be in place next year in London and in 2018 in Birmingham and other cities. Nitrogen dioxide, the pollutant at the heart of the legal case, has been at illegal levels in 90% of the country＊s air quality zones since 2010 and largely stems from diesel vehicles.EU law requires the government to cut the illegal pollution in the ※shortest possible time§ but legal NGO , which brought the cases, argued the government＊s plans  that could help achieve this.In the high court on Wednesday, Mr Justice Garnham agreed. He said it was ※remarkable§ that ministers knew they were using over-optimistic pollution modelling, based on flawed lab tests of diesel vehicles rather than , but proceeded anyway. He also said the law required the protection of health to come above the costs of measures: ※I reject any suggestion that the state can have any regard to cost.§The government said it would not appeal against the decision and agreed in court to discuss with ClientEarth a new timetable for more realistic pollution modelling and the steps needed to bring pollution levels down to legal levels. The parties will return to court in a week but if agreement cannot be reached, the judge could impose a timetable upon the government.At prime minister＊s questions, May said: ※We now recognise that Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] has to look at the judgment made by the courts and we now have to look again at the proposals we will bring forward.

The UK＊s duty to cut illegal air pollution as quickly as possible derives from EU laws but the action required following the high court defeat will be taken well before Brexit takes place. The government has said it will transfer all EU rules into UK law but, post-Brexit, the government could revise air pollution legislation.The court defeat is also a blow for the . Its approval depended on the effectiveness of the government＊s national air pollution plan to meet legal requirements on air quality. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: ※This ruling deals a huge blow to May＊s reckless Heathrow expansion plans.

The further cities and towns that now need to introduce clean air zones will be determined by the more realistic pollution modelling ordered by the court on Wednesday.Keith Taylor, Green party MEP, said: ※The failure highlighted by the judge today is as much moral as it is legal: ministers have displayed an extremely concerning attitude of indifference towards their duty to safeguard the health of British citizens.§"																																																			
"Al Gore believes that Donald Trump will not halt the momentum of the climate movement even if he withdraws the US from the .Speaking at a press engagement for his new documentary An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, the former US vice-president and environmental activist said that he was confident Trump would commit to the historic climate change agreement, but that even if he did not, it would still not be enough to reverse the move towards renewable energy in many American cities.※I don＊t know what [Trump＊s decision] will be, but I think there＊s an excellent chance that he will surprise many by deciding to stay in the Paris agreement,§ Gore said. ※But in the first four months of his presidency, we have already learned that he cannot stop the solutions to the climate crisis.

I like Justin but I will put a little asterisk on that,§ he said.Gore said that, despite the progress made, the threat of climate change remained ※far higher than any challenge humanity has ever confronted§.※The dangers we face from the climate crisis are now more severe than what the scientists predicted. It has gotten worse. But the primary message of the movie is: we now have the solutions available. We can solve this. And we are beginning to implement these solutions.

"Light pollution is causing spring to come at least a week earlier in the UK, a new study has revealed.The report, , found that budburst in trees occurs up to 7.5 days earlier in brighter areas, with later-budding species being more affected.The link between light pollution and changes in animal behaviour , but this is the first time its impact specifically on plant phenology has been examined on a national scale.The paper＊s authors believe that this early budburst is likely to have a knock-on effect on the life cycles of insects and birds that live in sync with the trees. Professor Richard ffrench-Constant from the University of Exeter＊s Centre for Ecology and Conservation, who led the research, stressed that the study＊s results: ※highlight the need to carry out experimental investigation into the impact of artificial night-time lighting on phenology and species interactions.§Its authors also emphasise the need for further research into the impacts of differing wavelengths or qualities of light that can be generated by different lighting types. The study used data from citizen scientists across the UK, as part of the 13-year dataset that it examined. The Woodland Trust asks people to record when they first saw sycamore, oak, ash and beech trees in leaf as part of its Nature＊s Calendar initiative. Speaking about the research, Dr Kate Lewthwaite, Woodland Trust citizen science manager, said: ※Analysis of Nature＊s Calendar data suggests that increased urbanisation is continuing to put pressure on the natural world, in ways that we could not have foreseen.※As the seasons become less and less predictable, our native wildlife may struggle to keep up with fluctuations that affect habitats and food sources. Hopefully this research will lead to new thinking on how to tackle such issues, and will help influence future development decisions.§"																																																			
"The global air pollution crisis killing more than 6 million people a year must be tackled by governments as a matter of urgency and not just left to the private sector, a report from the world＊s leading energy authority says.An increase of investment in energy of about 7% a year could tackle the problem, and would pay for itself through health benefits and better social conditions, the International  Agency estimates.Its report says air pollution is often seen as a social problem but the economic consequences are huge, . Lost work from air pollution is an increasing issue for rapidly developing cities, for instance.Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, told the Guardian that governments should take more responsibility: ※Air pollution does not get the attention it deserves. It is a global problem, and it is extremely important. It is a crisis.§The energy industry is a leading source of pollution 每 including sulphur and  每 that cause breathing difficulties in vulnerable people, including children and older people, and can lead to premature death. Another key problem is that about 2.7 billion people around the world are still dependent on wood and waste fires that cause indoor air pollution, affecting women and young children the most.At least  are believed to be dying from air pollution, and many more lives are harmed, according to experts. But governments have been slow to respond, according to the first IEA report on the issue. If they act, the problem could be halved in the next three decades, the IEA says.Air quality has been identified as the fourth-largest threat to human health, after high blood pressure, poor diet and smoking. Eight in 10 of the cities around the world that monitor the problem exceed the levels at which harm is caused.This is the first time the IEA, which normally confines itself to statistics on energy use and , has ventured into this territory. Birol said it was a measure of the seriousness of the problem, which was costing the global economy billions a year.He said the most important thing to be done was for governments to take responsibility and put in place the policies needed 每 such as regulation of industry 每 as well as to cooperate with each other. Clean energy sources such as renewables could play a key role, he added.Energy production and use account for about 85% of particulate matter and almost all of the sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides, the IEA report says.It notes that  for governments, as fertilisers used on intensively farmed fields can cause problems both for air pollution and agriculture. Nitrous oxide and ammonia, arising from fertilisers, are more powerful than carbon in terms of trapping heat in the atmosphere, and can combine with other emissions to form more harmful gases.

"Tomorrow, the horticultural industry gathers in Birmingham at the , with the major high street retailers deciding how and what we will grow in our gardens next year. Yet among the commercial bustle, there remains a deafening silence that shames this ?5bn business and our national passion 每 why is peat still being used in our?gardens?The importance of our remaining peatlands to people and planet is hard to overstate. They are the unrivalled kings of carbon storage. Known peatlands cover about 3% of the world＊s land surface yet store twice as much carbon as all of Earth＊s standing forest and provide a haven to unique wildlife 每 from threatened wild flowers through dragonflies to curlews. Yet 2m cubic metres of peat are sold annually for us to plant begonias?and tomatoes.?There is growing demand for peat-free alternatives: a 2017 survey conducted by Plantlife, Friends of the Earth, RSPB and?the  Trusts established that consumers are crying out for peat-free products, yet a third of respondents couldn＊t find?peat-free compost?clearly available. And sales of peat are still increasing despite the looming 2020 government ban.Carbon-rich peat, dating back millennia and growing at a rate of only 1mm a year, makes up over half of the compost?sold every year in the UK. The government needs to give a shot of adrenalin to its commitment to phase out peat and support the industry to divest away from peat and keep what remains safely protected in the ground not the grow bag.

"As the motor car industry is at the forefront of environmental degradation both globally and locally, it is only right that manufacturers take a lead in tackling the problem (, 22 August). Instead, they offer only a scheme to sell more cars based on an unproven theory. This appears to posit that the pollution created by running an ※old§ car is so much greater than that of running a ※new§ one, that an environmental disaster might be delayed if we buy new cars more quickly. If Ford will reveal their figures for this old/new pollution differential and compare them with an evaluation of the pollution created in manufacturing a brand-new vehicle, then we might establish whether or not they know what they are talking about."																																																			
"Emissions from the electricity sector in the three months to June dropped by the biggest amount on record, as the effect of the Hazelwood coal-fired power station closure is seen for the first time in quarterly projections produced exclusively for the Guardian.But even that drop wasn＊t enough to stop Australia＊s overall greenhouse gas emissions from continuing to rise. Emissions from almost every other sector 每 industrial energy, transport, industrial heat and agriculture 每 all rose. They are the highest levels seen since before the carbon tax was repealed, according to . The results mean Australia has now consumed 24% of its carbon budget set by the government＊s  每 the total amount of carbon it can release from 2013 while doing its fair share to keep global warming under 2C. Once a certain amount of carbon goes into the atmosphere, warming over 2C will be inevitable.The report replicates the government＊s methodology for its  quarterly reports, which the government traditionally delays releasing for up to nine months, and has in the past saved up and  in a batch .Australia＊s overall greenhouse gas emissions over the year to June 2017 were the highest since 2011, with emissions rising steadily since the carbon tax was repealed in 2014.The most recent quarter 每 the three months to June 2017 每 also had the highest emissions for any June quarter since 2011, rising to 3m tonnes more than the same quarter last year.However, emissions from electricity dropped significantly, by about 4.3m tonnes compared with the previous quarter, or about 2m tonnes compared with the June quarter last year. The drop was mostly due to the , which was Australia＊s most polluting generator.Increased generation from Snowy Hydro in the quarter also contributed to the lower emissions from the electricity sector, said Stephen Christos from Ndevr Environmental.But that reduction was overwhelmed by other sectors, which all increased or stayed stable.The most notable increase was in the ※stationary energy§ sector, which includes fuel burned for heat and energy in industry other than electricity. Emissions for stationary energy were the second-highest on record in the most recent quarter＊s projections, having risen steeply over the past year.Among the significant factors pushing up the emissions in stationary energy are , which are also responsible for Australia＊s tight and expensive domestic gas market. The liquefying and exporting of huge volumes of Australia＊s gas has left the domestic market with relatively little gas, pushing up costs for consumers.The drop in emissions from electricity over the past 12 months was cancelled out by the increase in emissions from stationary energy, with electricity dropping by 5.3m tonnes and stationary energy growing by 5.8m tonnes.Transport emissions also rose significantly 每 by more than 2.2m tonnes above the same quarter last year. The results are drawing Australia further from its carbon reduction targets made after the , which was adopted in December 2015.Compared with a hypothetical situation where Australia cut its emissions linearly from when they were made according to its commitment, Australia＊s most recent quarterly emissions are now exceeding its Paris commitments by 5.53m tonnes, and exceeding the science-based cuts recommended by the Climate Change Authority by 14.74m tonnes."																																																			
"Serious pollution incidents in the UK from livestock farms are now a weekly occurrence, leading to damage to wildlife, fish, farm livestock and air and water pollution.The  in England and its devolved counterparts in Wales and Scotland recorded 536 of the most severe incidents between 2010 and 2016, the worst instances among more than 5,300 cases of agricultural pollution in the period across Britain. In England and Wales the figures relate to pig, poultry and dairy farms whereas in Scotland they refer to all livestock farms., uncovering the unpublished figures, also reveals that even serious pollution incidents may not be prosecuted, and farms that have caused pollution continue to receive subsidies. There is no official estimate of the cost of the damage caused, or the cost of cleanups, but many farmers appear to be struggling with the price of preventing pollution, a situation that may deteriorate as . In many cases the breaches are likely to be the result of underinvestment in equipment such as slurry stores.There is also evidence that some farmers may be ignoring pollution risks and regard the fines incurred if caught as a cost of doing business. One exasperated inspector noted in a log following farm inspections that the culprits were ※leading criminal lifestyles§.The investigation found:Data obtained by freedom of information requests shows that in total more than 3,000 cases of pollution from dairy, poultry and pig farms were recorded by the Environment Agency in England alone between 2010 and 2016.Magistrates can force farmers to pay up to ?50,000 or sentence them to six months＊ imprisonment for a serious offence. However, most cases never reach court. The Environment Agency is known to have brought 134 prosecutions in total in England relating to agriculture in the six years between 2010 and 2016, though the real figure could be higher as the agency does not publish full details of every prosecution. Of the cases brought, the vast majority 每 128 over the period 每 resulted in guilty verdicts, with 119 fines levied, three conditional discharges, and two remediation orders imposed. The largest fine was ?45,000, and the smallest ?300. Only 23 of the fines were of ?10,000 or above, though magistrates are empowered to levy ?50,000. Of the total, 68 cases related to water, 45 to waste, 19 to permits for ※integrated pollution prevention and control§, and two were in regard to the monitoring of emissions.Dairy farms account for the great majority of the recorded instances of agricultural pollution: of the 3,700 recorded in both England and Wales from 2010 to 2016, just over 2,000 involved dairy farms, while 664 were linked to poultry farms and 444 to pig farms.  incidents in the two most serious categories, which are deemed to have had a major or significant impact on the environment, were also more frequent on dairy farms, which accounted for 351 of the total of 424 from 2010 to 2016, with 38 on pig and 35 on poultry farms. The highest number of the most serious incidents, at 125 reported events, were on farms in the south-west, followed by the Midlands, which had 55. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency was not able to provide a breakdown of incidents by farm type. are also a particular cause of concern. In the Environment Agency data for England, the farms are not identified by size. However, internal agency data obtained as part of the investigation shows that more than 1,000 instances of non-compliance with regulations at large intensive farms were identified in each of the last three years: 1,201 in 2014, 1,330 in 2015 and 1,265 in 2016. Large intensive farms, many of which fit the US definition of a megafarm, which is not officially used in the UK, are on the rise.The Environment Agency said: ※Agriculture uses 70% of the land in England and farmers have a major impact on the environment. Most farmers act responsibly and we work with the industry to respond to incidents, tackle the root causes of pollution and promote good practice. But where farmers are responsible for serious pollution incidents, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action, including prosecution. Agriculture is the single biggest source of serious pollution incidents and all farmers have a duty to prevent it.§However, many farmers are struggling to comply with regulations because of the . These are likely to worsen under Brexit, with little indication on what subsidies will operate after 2022 and the unknown effects of future trade deals.  by rising input prices and the squeeze from supermarkets. The average , Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) figures show. Last year it said nearly one in 10 dairy farmers in England and Wales stopped producing milk as some were still being paid 10p a litre less than the cost of production. Milk is still often cheaper than bottled water.Yet the cost of farming in an environmentally responsible fashion remains high. Removing  that is not needed costs about ?12.50 a ton for a contractor to put it into bags, which cost ?600 each. A new slurry store for 100 cows could cost between ?7,500 and more than ?100,000. Nicola Dunn, water quality advisor for the National Farmers Union, said falling profits might explain why some farmers have not invested in improvements which would prevent pollution. ※Farms with insecure futures cannot justify such expenditure,§ she said.While most farmers comply with the law, and most are open to inspections, the logs from the Welsh environment agency obtained as part of the investigation show there are farms marked as ※hostile§ which are too risky for inspectors to visit unless there are two of them. On one occasion when a minor incident of slurry draining on to a road was reported, officers did not attend at all as the farm was flagged up as hostile. ※No attendance due to uncertainty regarding the farmer,§ the inspector said. In another entry, a farmer refused to be interviewed by officers and complained they were harassing him. In another case inspectors warned the farmer ※has got a very quick temper and can change from being calm and amenable to quite fiery in a short space of time. He has instructed officers to get off the farm at least twice.§One inspector wrote: ※Where we have ongoing non-compliance and penalties imposed are seen as a running cost, the traditional enforcement solutions have to be challenged [...] It seems that there are three farms in Carmarthenshire where the enforcement history could meet the definition of criminal lifestyle.§"																																																			
"Lynda and Richard Whittemore bought Quennells farm in the quiet Sussex countryside six years ago. They were hoping for what Lynda calls ※an idyllic lifestyle§, tending their flock of 400 pedigree sheep and 45 cattle on 180 acres of farmland. ※We have an undulating field at the back of the stream, winding to the other corner,§ Lynda says. ※Usually it has lovely clear water, with a gentle slope down to the water supply. It＊s picturesque 每 the [livestock] don＊t need troughs, they can walk down to drink the water.§Next door to Quennells was another farm, Crouchland. This farm was not a small-scale, pedigree operation. Crouchland had an anaerobic digester, a government subsidised dome that turns food and agricultural waste into gas which can be sold to the national grid to heat homes. Crouchland also built extra slurry vats in order to store the noxious byproducts of this process.In March 2015 there was a ※nasty spill of digestate§, says Lynda Whittemore, a toxic mix of slurry and chemicals linked back to Crouchland farm. It poisoned 70 acres of Quennells farmland. Whittemore recalls seeing it. ※Thick, black smelly tarry stuff flowing down our stream. It was chugging along killing little frogs, fish and invertebrates. They were wiped out.§The Whittemores were advised by the  to take their livestock out of the field, well away from the polluted stream after the first incident in May 2015. They had to sell their lambs earlier than intended and dig the stream out. On that occasion they were given compensation. Eleven months later, they say the stream was polluted again.※This time it was smoother, blacker. It seemed even more toxic to me. The devastating thing was that we were about two weeks away from lambing. We had 430 pregnant ewes,§ says Lynda.The sheep were placed on a farmtrack, they say, without access to grass. Due to the incident they lost about 30 lambs more than usual, according to their vet, with a knock-on effect on profits. Pedigree lambs were sold at normal market rate, a fraction of their real value. The Whittemores have applied for compensation, but Crouchland has gone into administration and declined to say whether they disputed the Whittemores＊ claim. The claim continues.Crouchland, near the village of Plaistow, in Sussex, was prosecuted for polluting a stream in 2013. The farm＊s biogas business went into administration this month. In a statement, its administrators, FRP Advisory, said it ※could not comment on regulatory matters relating to the business or land§ but said the anaerobic digestion plant was ※lawful§. Crouchland received nearly ?80,000 in common agricultural policy subsidies in 2015-16.  The prevalence of pollution incidents, uncovered by the  and the Guardian, means that cases like that of the Whittemores are now affecting hundreds of rural dwellers every year, with a new case of serious pollution occurring on average at least once a week. That number represents just the cases that make it to official reporting 每 experts and rural campaigners believe the true number of incidents may be far greater because of farmers failing to report incidents they believe are contained within their land, unwillingness among their neighbours to ※shop§ them even if they are affected, or a failure by the authorities to investigate reports of potential incidents.Many of the breaches are accidental, but without adequate cleanup they can cause serious damage. And without changes to equipment and working practices, the pollution incidents are more likely to happen again. In some cases, farms have been found guilty of multiple breaches, with farmers either unable to afford the work necessary to fix the problem, or willing to cover it up by scaring away inspectors or shrugging off fines as a cost of doing business. incidents have a much wider effect than on just the bordering farms and residences. When waterways are polluted, by slurry spills or pesticide misuse for instance, the effects can be disastrous on streams and on rivers. Fish kills are one common result, while the escape of noxious substances into ponds can deprive underwater life of oxygen, rendering the environs biologically dead, potentially for years if they are not regenerated.Not even future farming leaders are immune. Plumpton College, an agricultural college that teaches best practices, was discovered to be responsible for five pollution incidents from 2011 to 2016, at its working dairy farm. Last November, 20 tonnes of slurry poured into a tributary of the river Ouse, home to sea trout and protected fish such as brook lampreys and bullheads. At least 1,200 fish died when the slurry flowed down the rivulet, covering its surface with a dirty foam.The Environment Agency is investigating two more potential breaches at the Plumpton College dairy farm. None of this has stopped the college from receiving ?500,000 in taxpayer-funded EU subsidies.Jeremy Kerswell, the principal of Plumpton College, said he was unable to comment in detail on the incident from last November for legal reasons, but said the college ※wholeheartedly values and promotes best practice in all aspects of its operations on the environment. We seek to promote and benefit all natural fauna and flora, our neighbours (close and distant) and the wider public.§ He added: ※A major reorganisation and investment programme is currently under way to promote best practice in all aspects of our farming activities and to reduce any adverse impact in our operations.§The issue of subsidies is of particular concern to , chair of parliament＊s Environmental Audit Committee and MP for Wakefield. She called for ※a much closer link between subsidies and good practice§, urging that any farm business found damaging the environment should lose its taxpayer handouts.※There＊s consensus across political parties that the future of farm subsidies has to be linked to public good,§ she said. ※It＊s about incentivising good behaviour, penalising bad behaviour. These are businesses: this is corporate crime. The financial penalty should match the offence.  companies pay out millions if they pollute. There are farmers across the country causing the same amount of damage and getting away with a slap on the wrist.§The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pointed out that the criteria for subsidies under the common agricultural policy are set by the EU. A spokesperson said: ※We are making real progress towards reducing pollution from farming, but we are determined to do more. Already we＊ve invested over ?12m to help tackle agricultural emissions and are working with the farming industry on a new strategy which will make further progress. To continue delivering significant reductions in soil and fertiliser runoff, we are helping farmers reduce water pollution through Natural England＊s catchment sensitive farming programme, which offers free advice and training to farmers.§Agricultural pollution takes many forms, but by far the most common is leaks and . Livestock keepers are required to have adequate removal arrangements or storage facilities for any slurry produced, but these need regular maintenance and monitoring. Tanks can collapse, overflow, or fail to drain properly, while pipes can become blocked, break or leak. is a particular problem, with the UK＊s 2m-strong herd producing enough manure to fill the Shard 每 the UK＊s tallest building 每 in less than five days, or 78 Shards a year. It can be used to fertilise crops, but only at certain times of year, so must be stored in between. Inappropriate use of slurry as fertiliser, or overuse followed by heavy rain, can also pollute waterways or surrounding fields.Other forms of pollution include: the release of silage liquor, a noxious and highly corrosive effluent from the compacted and fermented crops fed to livestock in winter; the burial or inappropriate disposal of animal carcasses; and storage breaches of pesticides. Intensive farming can also produce , harming waterways and even reaching the seas. Agricultural pollution is an ※endemic problem§, and the major cause of the drastic decline in UK freshwater fish species, according to Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust. ※Other processes such as waste management, sewerage and chemical plants have rightly been very heavily regulated to reduce their pollution significantly in recent decades, but agriculture seems to enjoy special status, in spite of the billions of pounds of taxpayers＊ money being spent on subsidies.§Pollution from farms needs to be addressed urgently, according to experts and campaign groups, especially as . Stephen Marsh-Smith, chief executive of Afonydd Cymru, the body that protects Welsh rivers, said: ※If you＊re trying to restore a river, you cannot have frequent pollution dumps with fish dying. It can take up to 10 years to recover. Poor regulation and enforcement by government is allowing this to happen.§The Environment Agency said: ※While rivers in England are the healthiest they have been for 20 years, we recognise pollution from farms can have significant impact on rivers and the environment. We take pollution incidents seriously and targeting pollution from farms is one of our priorities. We respond quickly to incidents to limit the impact of pollutants and, where appropriate, we take action against those responsible.§Back at Quennells, Lynda Whittemore says that the ecology of their farm is recovering, to an extent. The stream runs clear again now, but they say many trees died. She and her husband say they would have to give up farming if it happened again as seeing their livestock die was traumatic. ※It＊s quite horrible to think there were toxic products travelling through our farm. It should be stopped.§ The business has gone into administration but the Crouchland complex remains and the villagers wonder who will clean it up and pay for it. The Whittemores both feel that the Environment Agency is toothless. ※They should have the power to close places down if they keep doing this.§"

" gargantuan truck fills the driveway of Tori Amos＊s Cornwall home. The surrounding countryside is tranquil 每 verdant hills, stone farm buildings, golden crops swaying in the late August sun 每 but a throng of activity greets us at the home/recording studio Amos shares with her producer husband, Mark Hawley. The van and attending crew, she says, curled up on the sofa in her library, are here to collect one of her beloved B?sendorfer pianos for an impending European tour. ※She＊s being put in her case,§ explains Amos. ※Hopefully with a nice blanket.§Amos was raised in Maryland, a Led Zeppelin-loving daughter of a minister, and self-taught pianist who would jilt both church and conservatoire to forge her own sound in the 90s: wildly original, taboo-busting piano pop. She cut through grunge＊s squall, playing two, sometimes three, piano keyboards simultaneously, while wearing 7in stilettos. Her music is celebrated enough to warrant the occasional benevolent ribbing 每 the animated series Bob＊s Burgers recently had an Amos-esque woman using lyrics about an oil spill as a metaphor for her vagina 每 and has been an indelible influence on today＊s musicians, acknowledged by ,  and .Native Invader, released this week, is Amos＊s 15th studio album, some 25 years on from her solo debut Little Earthquakes. She is feeling ※fortunate, blessed§ about this benchmark. ※But writing is still nerve-racking, mostly because I＊m waiting for the muses to turn up.§ She has jump-started the process in previous years; a penchant for , for example, is well documented. ※Oh, I haven＊t done those in a while,§ says the 54-year-old. ※I＊m leaving that to the youth now.§Those 18-hour-long ayahuasca trips could be heavy going, says Amos, but nothing tested her creativity quite like the menopause. ※That＊s the harshest teacher I＊ve met; harsher than fame. I was in the thick of it during [her 2014 album] Unrepentant Geraldines. But I＊m on the other side of it now,§ she smiles. ※I can see possibilities again.§ The ※muses§ saved her, but they took an age to show up. ※And when they weren＊t there, I was a stranger to myself.§It was a trip through the Great Smoky Mountains, her late Cherokee grandfather＊s ancestral lands, last autumn that grounded her. Trekking through the Appalachian sub-range (a stretch that bridges North Carolina and Tennessee), she imagined her ※Poppa§ as a boy, treading those same routes. ※In that moment, we shared something; seeds were planted. I didn＊t recognise them at the time, though. It was very humbling.§Poppa＊s influence runs deep on Native Invader, peaking in the urgent thrum of the album＊s standout single, Up the Creek. When she was a girl, Poppa taught her about  每 the sacred navigational paths of the indigenous folk. ※We＊d take walks. He＊d smoke his pipe, tell me his people＊s stories. There was no fanfare to it. I just drank it all in, like a weed.§Lineage and land, then, are dovetailing influences on this album. Resilience, too, the environmental kind 每 climate change hangs heavy 每 and the psychological, both in the face of Trump-era chaos. In the US last year, while working on a song for the Netflix teen drama Audrie & Daisy, Amos experienced the poison he has spread first-hand. ※I remember flying into Florida and sitting next to a woman who chanted, ＆＊ the whole way there. Oh! Such hate,§ she says. ※After that, I began to see the polarities; people unfriending family members on Facebook ＃§The schisms bore an unsettling similarity to Poppa＊s accounts of post-civil war life, gleaned from his mother, Little Margaret, a formidable, tomahawk-wielding matriarch who had evaded the forced relocation of  by means of taking refuge in the Smokies. ※I remember Poppa telling me how cousins would fight cousins, how some families still hadn＊t healed, a hundred or so years later. The similarities terrified me. I cocooned myself there for a minute, and the muses weren＊t coming.§In January, Amos＊s 88-year-old mother, Mary Ellen, had a stroke, ※and everything changed§. Before the attack, which has left Mary unable to speak and requiring round-the-clock care, mother and daughter had spoken often. About the election? ※About everything.§ Doctors say it＊s difficult to assess the damage, ※but I believe she＊s still with us,§ says Amos gently. ※She remembers songs, certain hymns, the Beatles＊ Penny Lane. She was, is, such a believer that all things can be healed by taking a walk; that all the answers are there, in nature. To see Mary under attack from this stroke, and to see America herself, Lady Liberty, under attack 每 it＊s a terrible parallel.§Matriarchal power 每 in deities, myths, archetypes 每 has been a perpetual touchstone in Amos＊s work, and is still present; I notice a pack of tarot-like Goddess Oracle cards on her library desk. Post-menopause, she is discovering a ※different kind of fertility§ in her work. She is honouring Gaia, and pulling no punches when it comes to naming the would-be architects of her destruction: ※Those pimps in Washington, raping the land,§ she sings on Benjamin, a track on the new album.※I think mother earth is being incredibly resilient against a government that seems hell-bent on exploiting her resources,§ she says. ※So she is under attack, and yet, when I walk in her bounty, I don＊t get the sense that she＊s giving up, or defeated. I do sense that [feeling] in people though.§She says that paranoia and fear permeated the tours for her post-9/11 album, Scarlet＊s Walk, but she＊d encountered the ※smell, the taste§ of political influence, years before, playing to piano bar lobbyist crowds in Georgetown, Washington, throughout her teens. ※I was at a very impressionable age, performing for people making huge backroom decisions about the country. That was back when [Trump＊s Supreme Court appointee] Neil Gorsuch＊s mother was head of the Environmental Protection Agency.;  I played through all of that.§Remaining creative in the face of the machine, she says, is vital. ※You can＊t beat a bully at his own games. And I＊m not talking about one particular bully here; it＊s energy. You have to out-create the destruction 每 it＊s the only way.§But first, says Amos, the US must face its shame: its crimes against the First Nations, from Andrew Jackson＊s 1830 Indian Removal Act to the bulldozers that crushed  this February. ※I＊m not in a position to speak for First Nation people 每 that＊s a sacred task. But, as an observer, it seems to me that, unlike Germany, we＊ve never had to really face our holocaust. Until we do that, the healing can＊t begin.§In the Smokies, she encountered locals who were oblivious to the land＊s fraught history and had no idea they were inhabiting sacred songline territory. The ignorance she encountered stunned her and left her meditating on her own complicated lineage: a family tree that includes both Native Americans and Confederate soldiers.It was Amos＊s physician sister, Marie Amos Dobyns, a member of the Association of American Indian Physicians, who prompted the pilgrimage. ※Marie＊s a big believer in championing the voiceless; I didn＊t truly understand that until Mary lost hers.§ Dobyns has forged deep friendships in the Native-American medicine communities over the years, says Amos, kinships she has been generous enough to share with Amos. ※I call them the ＆Seattle sweat lodge sisters＊. There＊s nothing I＊ve experienced like [sitting in a sweat lodge with them]; you feel so nurtured, so given to. But there＊s a nakedness, a vulnerability, you have to bring to it in order to receive that.§Vulnerability 每 men＊s, in particular 每 is tackled compassionately on the Native Invader song Wings: ※Sometimes, big boys, they need to cry.§ Is she referencing anyone in particular here? ※Oh, I see it all around me: in my marriage, in my crew.§ Men can spend hours gabbing in the pub, Amos says, without ever articulating their feelings. When, I wonder, did Trump last cry? Would we all be safer from the epidemic of toxic white masculinity 每 Charlottesville, Dylann Roof,  每 if men could own their fragility? ※Listen, we have all heard men being called a certain female body part when they cry. And we all know the real power of that body part; talk about a multitasker! Emotional vulnerability takes bravery. Great male leaders through the ages have understood this.§Trump＊s most bilious voters 每 the ones who invoke God＊s name with white hoods and burning crosses 每 are anything but brave, says Amos, and definitely not true, compassionate Christians. As a former Jesus groupie, or ※recovering Christian§ as her Boys for Pele-era tour T-shirts touted, Amos is uniquely qualified to know. ※Some of Mary＊s carers, they really walk the walk. They practise their faith on a daily basis and they glow with it. Mary had 每 has 每 that glow, that containment, too. But she＊s got a fight on her hands now, to stay on the planet.§On her impending tour, how will Amos endure the miles between mother and daughter? Will she cut things short should the worst happen? ※It＊s day-to-day right now,§ she says, after a long, heavy pause. ※I＊ve been doing music since I was two and a half; it＊s the thing that makes sense to me.§ And yet, at her peak, Amos didn＊t always make sense to her critics. In the 90s, her genius was frequently couched in misogynistic backhanders by the music press: she was a ※weird chick§ in Q; a ※Grade-A, class-one, turbo-driven fruitcake§ in the NME. ※And they weren＊t all men, those critics,§ Amos points out wryly.

"here is 每 you may have noticed 每 a certain sort of middle-class, middle-aged man who decides he＊s going to burn off the angst of advancing age through aggressive exercise. He＊s going to do marathons and triathlons and so on; he＊s going to muscle his way out of mortality.Now, exercise is normally considered a healthy way of relieving stress and dealing with internal issues. However, some of these midlife fitness fanatics rage against the dying of the light just a little too hard and their rage runneth over. A recent well-publicised incident in London was perhaps an example of that. On Thursday, the Metropolitan police  as part of an investigation into an incident in which a jogger appeared to knock a female pedestrian into the path of an oncoming bus.Admittedly, this would be a rather extreme example of middle-age runner rage. But, looking at the coverage it caused, one could be forgiven for thinking that it was symptomatic of a far greater problem. Namely, the scourge of egregious exercisers on city streets. Indeed, the past few days have seen non-stop huffing and puffing about how ※hogger joggers§ and ※Lycra louts§ are a blight on Britain. And despite the fact that no bikes were involved in the Putney bridge incident, some commentators have managed to spin the event into a denouncement of all things bike-related. On Friday, for example,  went on a tirade about how ※cyclists are the worst§, particularly the ※middle-aged male cyclist§.There is a technical term for this sort of cyclist: a middle-age man in Lycra or a Mamil. The existence of the curious Mamil was first discovered . The Mamil has proliferated ever since; the word was added to  in 2014. A single hectare of affluent urban jungle may contain several microspecies of Mamil, each with its own subtle quirks. According to the Telegraph, for example, a trusted source in such matters, we＊re now seeing the rise of the  as more middle-aged men take up mountain biking. Experts have hypothesised that the expensive nature of mountain biking is the reason why it is increasingly becoming a sport for the older man. Millennials, of course,  每 a decent mountain bike is as unattainable a dream as a mortgage.The Mamil is often the subject of light mockery; the term ※midlife crisis§ is often bandied around. However, according to a recent study by the University of East London, dressing up in high-performance spandex isn＊t just a slightly more expensive version of a kid pretending to be Superman. Rather,  found: ※Mamils aren＊t cycling primarily to relive their youth or prove they can still compete against other men. Instead, their motivations are ... tied to the desire for good mental as well as physical health.§Which all sounds well and good, except for the fact 每 as Moir reminds us 每 that Mamils can be hazardous to everyone else＊s health. In fact, anyone attempting to do some exercise is an automatic danger to society. Ladies who lunge; tykes on bikes; schoolkids on scooters; yoga bros; weekend warriors ＃ our streets teem with an entire ecosystem of fiendish fitness fanatics. And, I hate to say this, but to some degree Moir has a point. Take, for example, the menacing Marsupeal: Middle-Aged Rich Suburban Parents Exercising Avec Luxury Stroller. OK, so as acronyms go, that was sort of a stretch, but you know what I mean: pushy parents who strap their newborn into a race-car-buggy hybrid and then go sprinting down the street using their high-speed stroller like a battering ram. If you see a Marsupeal charging at you, it＊s best to cross the street quickly.Ultimately, however, cyclists, joggers and parents with posh pushchairs make easy targets. Particularly cyclists; the media loves to hate people on bikes, for some reason. Sure, some behave badly: we＊ve all witnessed cyclists who treat public streets like their personal velodromes. But, you know what? Not all villains wear Lycra. Bad cyclists are nothing compared with all the bad drivers out there. The king of the urban jungle, the most dangerous thing on our streets, is the car. Yet we seem to take hostile driving as part and parcel of city life. , there were 1,810 road deaths in the UK in the year ending September 2016; most of these were caused by cars. And, last year,  that the number of drunk drivers involved in road accidents had increased for the first time in a decade. Then there are all the secondary ways in which cars are killing us. Air pollution plays a role in  each year in the UK; the World Health Organization has called it . Cars are responsible for emitting significant amounts of these toxins.So, perhaps we ought to give the men in tights a break. There are some dangerous Mamils out there, granted. But if more people avoided cars and strapped on their running shoes or jumped on a bike, the streets would be a lot safer for all of us."																																																			
" in several different ways. First, sea level rise caused by global warming increased the storm surge and therefore the coastal inundation and flooding from the storm. Second, the warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, which intensifies extreme precipitation events like the  associated with Harvey. Third, warmer ocean waters essentially act as hurricane fuel, which may have made Harvey more intense than it would otherwise have been.There are other possible human factors at play about which we have less certainty. For example, it＊s possible that  because of changes in atmospheric circulation patterns associated with human-caused global warming. , his research has shown that these sorts of stationary summer weather patterns tend to happen more often in a hotter world, but we can＊t yet say if that happened in Harvey＊s case.Other human activities also worsened Harvey＊s impacts. For example, Houston suffers from urban sprawl, covering a larger area (nearly 600 square miles) than the cities of Chicago, San Francisco, Washington DC, Boston, Manhattan, and Santa Barbara . With urban sprawl and  came expansive  每 absorbent soil covered instead by concrete and asphalt, increasing flood risks. Houston＊s  combined with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) also encouraged development in flood prone areas. Private insurance companies don＊t want to insure homes that face a significant risk of flooding, but with a lack of regulation and/or government insurance offered by NFIP, development in relatively high-risk flood areas can be profitable. That is, until a flood strikes.  and will be unable to recover most of their losses from Hurricane Harvey. Others are covered by  before Harvey. That＊s because NFIP hasn＊t been charging sufficiently high premiums, in large part because it has underestimated flood risks based on . And climate change is amplifying those flood risks.It＊s a challenging problem because for homeowners living in areas where flood risks have significantly increased, flood insurance premiums should hypothetically increase significantly to cover those risks. But factors like rising sea levels and expanding urban sprawl that contribute to that increased risk aren＊t the fault of the homeowners, who can then become angry constituents for politicians working on updating NFIP. And so needed changes to the program have yet to be made.As a result, the government is effectively subsidizing the costs associated with living in high-risk flood areas. Between 1978 and 2005, NFIP paid out $5.5 billion (9.6% of paid claims)  (0.6% of the total covered by flood insurance) that each flooded an average of five times. Because the NFIP premiums are too low, taxpayers end up footing billions of dollars of those payouts.The situation is analogous to climate change. Without a price on carbon pollution, industries and individuals can dump carbon in the atmosphere for free. But that carbon pollution has costs that we eventually pay, in the form of increased property damage due to amplified storms like , for example. Or from higher food prices when farmers are struck by an intensified drought, or decreased worker productivity in heat waves, or valuable coastal property lost to encroaching sea levels, or homes lost to bigger wildfires and increased costs to fight them 每 the list of climate costs goes on and on. Those costs are eventually paid by taxpayers, but we＊re picking up the tab for the polluters. It＊s effectively a subsidy for the fossil fuel industry to the tune of , and as with artificially cheap flood insurance premiums, we＊re subsidizing risky behavior that ultimately causes severe damages.Ten days before Hurricane Harvey hit, the . The policy was implemented by the Obama administration, and required taxpayer-funded public infrastructure projects to plan for future flooding risks. Much infrastructure within and around Houston is now underwater, and accounting for future flooding risks when replacing it would be smart. But the Trump administration considered this policy a burdensome regulation, claiming that the infrastructure permitting process has too many ※.§ Apparently those ※inefficiencies§ include saving taxpayer money by reducing future flood losses.When asked about the causes and contributors to Hurricane Harvey and its damages, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt sidestepped the subject by using the Trump administration＊s favorite strategy 每 :Worse yet,  of ※engaging in attempts to politicize an ongoing tragedy.§ It＊s similar to the argument that we shouldn＊t talk about gun control in the aftermath of a mass shooting. That＊s precisely when we should be working on solutions to prevent these types of disasters from happening again and again.Those who oppose climate policies will often argue that we can simply adapt to the consequences of human-caused climate change. Most recently,  that Harvey will just be a ※speed bump§ for Houston＊s economy, and that the world should follow Houston＊s example of ※environmental resilience§ by following ※the path of its extraordinary economic growth.§ The people in Texas suffering from having lost their homes and possessions probably aren＊t comforted that Stephens considers Harvey a ※speed bump§ for the local economy (which coincidentally is ). :There will be some of each, but the more we mitigate the problem by cutting carbon pollution, the less we will have to adapt to and suffer from the consequences of climate change. However, even adaptation takes action. We can take some steps to adapt to rising sea levels, but denying the problem by rolling back regulations aimed at doing just that shifts us further toward the suffering part of the equation. Economic growth has many benefits, but by itself does not move us in the direction of climate mitigation or adaptation.In short, to minimize the suffering caused by climate change, we need to be smarter about addressing the problem and adapting its consequences. Right now we＊re instead becoming stupider, and that will only lead to increased suffering. If we want to minimize the suffering caused by future Harveys, we need to talk about how climate change is making them worse, and we need to do something about it."																																																			
"The summer holiday washout wiped out a much needed bumper season for wildlife across the UK, according to wildlife experts at the .A normal winter and balmy spring provided ideal conditions for birds, insects and plants but the heavy rains that rolled in during August dampened the promised bonanza. However, the weather patterns should see a good autumn for fungi and some nuts and berries.※The [wet August] was especially damaging for warmth-loving insects, including many butterflies and bees,§ said National Trust wildlife expert Matthew Oates. ※It means we haven＊t had a genuinely good summer since 2006 每 the wait goes on. As we all know, you can＊t rely on the weather.§The rains were ushered in by a southward shift of the jet stream, which usually shepherds wet weather to the north of the UK. Scientists expect climate change to result in wetter UK summers, possibly linked to rapid . The UK＊s wildlife is in decline, with a  finding one in 10 species are threatened with extinction and that the UK is ※among the most nature-depleted countries in the world§. The National Trust is the country＊s biggest farmer with 2,000 tenants and the biggest landowner after the Forestry Commission, and it is aiming to restore 25,000 hectares of wildlife-rich habitat by 2025.2017 began promisingly for wildlife, with a mild spring ensuring a good nesting season for many birds, with rarities such as the little tern doing well at Blakeney Point in Norfolk. The gentle spring also drew many flowers into blooming early, with daffodils in the Teign Valley woods appearing as early as mid-February and elder and dog rose appearing a month early at the end of April.Moderate temperatures also boosted roe deer in some parts of the country. Glen Graham, National Trust ranger at Wallington Hall, Northumberland, said there was a much higher kid survival rate this year.The early summer was dry and the RSPB said it received a lot of calls about house martin nests cracking, meaning chicks had to be moved into substitute containers. But the warm weather encouraged insects such as the purple emperor butterfly, which appeared at the National Trust＊s Bookham Common, Surrey in mid-June, the earliest sighting since 1893. The rare and spectacular crane fly  was also spotted at Maidenhead Thicket in Berkshire.But then the rains came, disrupting breeding, boosting the spread of diseases and leading to fast grass growth, which swamps the small plants many insects rely on. August had above average rainfall and the first half of the month was the , according to the Met Office.Matt Shardlow, from Buglife, said: ※The summer has been so disappointing that there has been a national debate about the sparsity of flying insects and the absence of unfortunate splats on car windscreens. In addition to summer rain the warm wet winter was deeply unhelpful to insects trying to hibernate. It has been one of the least bountiful years for yellow-jacket wasp I can recall.§The damp August was also the likely cause of the failure of nests established by  in June 每 only the third time in a decade such nests have been seen, according to the RSPB.The early summer heat followed by persistent rain is however likely to result in a good autumn for fungi, with waxcap fungi looking good on the National Trust＊s Golden Cap meadows in West Dorset, where 22 species have been recorded.Also benefitting are oaks, which have delivered huge acorns crops, and holly, which should provide plenty of berries for Christmas. But the early profusion of blackberries ended up rotting in the rain in many places."																																																			
"The climate ambitions of the  appear to be being watered down by the government as it is implemented, according to a draft Coag Energy Council implementation strategy obtained by the Guardian.The draft implementation plan removes a key recommendation for an agreed emissions trajectory for the electricity system, alignment with the Paris agreement and subsidised solar and batteries for low-income houses.Sources tell the Guardian the document was prepared by the federal government and distributed to state and territory representatives on the morning of the meeting, leaving little time for state representatives to analyse it.A final version of the document is expected to be delivered to Coag today.The federal environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, declined to comment on the document, saying: ※It is not appropriate for any government to comment on draft documents of the Council of Australian Governments.§Described by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, as a ※blueprint for the once-in-a-century transformation currently taking placing in Australia＊s energy system§, the Finkel review presented 50 recommendations to the Council of Australian Governments (Coag).Those recommendations were intended to solve the energy ※trilemma§ 每 delivering affordable and reliable electricity, while lowering emissions.The review itself was widely criticised for  when it came to action on climate change, and failing to align with Australia＊s commitments made in the Paris climate agreement.The key recommendation of the review was a clean energy target, which Frydenberg has , which includes a number of climate change deniers.But the party room agreed to the other 49 recommendations, which the Coag  Council is now advising heads of government on how to implement.At a teleconference on Friday last week, state and territory energy ministers were presented with a draft implementation plan for discussion.That document, obtained by the Guardian, appears to water down those recommendations in relation to climate change, and removes some altogether.One key recommendation in the Finkel review that has been severely weakened in the draft implementation document is a change that would force the electricity market to align efforts to meet government emissions reduction commitments made as part of the Paris agreement.Finkel＊s recommendation said Coag leaders should agree to a new Australian  Market Agreement, which commits all parties to ※a nationally consistent approach to energy policy that recognises Australia＊s commitment in Paris to reduce emissions and governments＊ commitment to align efforts to meet this target with energy market frameworks.§But the draft implementation document removes the reference to international emissions reduction commitments, instead saying merely that the agreement will ※reaffirm Australian governments＊ commitment to the [national electricity market] and a national, integrated approach to energy and emissions reduction policy§.Among Finkel＊s key recommendation for an ※orderly transition§, he called for three things: the clean energy target; a three-year notice of closure for existing large generators; and ※an agreed emissions reduction trajectory§. All three moves were part of one recommendation, numbered 3.2.The Coalition has not agreed to adopt the clean energy target but it has agreed to the three-year notice-of-closure rule, which appears in the implementation plan. However, the plan does not contain any mention of an agreed emissions reduction trajectory.Frydenberg told the Guardian his view is that the Coag Energy Council did not agree to the emissions reduction trajectory because it is part of the clean energy target.※The Coag Energy Council has agreed to implement the recommendations of the Finkel review except for the clean energy target, which includes the national electricity market emissions trajectory which the federal government is currently considering.§It is unclear why the emissions trajectory is considered part of the clean energy target, since the Finkel review makes clear that there are a number of mechanisms that could achieve such a trajectory. Finkel modelled several such mechanisms, including an emissions intensity scheme.Another Finkel recommendation calls for low-income households to be given subsidised access to ※energy efficient appliances, rooftop solar photovoltaic and battery storage systems§.Explicit references to renewable energy has been removed in the draft implementation plan and replaced with ※energy efficiency and demand management technologies§.Sources say representatives of the ACT raised the question of the trajectory being removed, and asked for it to be included. Representatives of Queensland and Victoria also apparently raised concerns about some of the other changes.Sources said the document, which was prepared by the federal government, was circulated to state energy ministers only hours before the meeting was held, leaving little time for proper scrutiny.The document is expected to be finalised and sent to heads of government today."																																																			
"Increasingly vulnerable ※chokepoints§ are threatening the security of the global food supply, according to a new report. It identifies 14 critical locations, including the Suez canal, Black Sea ports and Brazil＊s road network, almost all of which are already hit by frequent disruptions.With climate change bringing more incidents of extreme weather, analysts at the  warn that the risk of a major disruption is growing but that little is being done to tackle the problem. Food supply interruptions in the past have caused huge spikes in prices which can spark major conflicts.The chokepoints identified are locations through which exceptional amounts of the global food trade pass. More than half of the globe＊s staple crop exports 每 wheat, maize, rice and soybean 每 have to travel along inland routes to a small number of key ports in the US, Brazil and the Black Sea. On top of this, more than half of these crops 每 and more than half of fertilisers 每 transit through at least one of the maritime chokepoints identified.※We are talking about a huge share of global supply that could be delayed or stopped for a significant period of time,§ said Laura Wellesley, one of the authors of the Chatham House report. ※What is concerning is that, with climate change, we are very likely to see one or more of these chokepoint disruptions coincide with a harvest failure, and that＊s when things start to get serious.§The chokepoints are already suffering repeated disruptions, the report found. US inland waterways and railways, which carry 30% of the world＊s maize and soy, were hit by flooding that halted traffic in 2016 and a 2012 heatwave that kinked rail lines and caused derailments. The Panama canal has been hampered by drought, while the Suez canal has been closed by sandstorms and threatened by attempted terrorist bomb attacks. Brazil＊s muddy roads are often closed by heavy rain, with 3,000 trucks stranded earlier in 2017, while its vital southern ports have been closed by storms and floods. The only chokepoint that has not recently been disrupted is the Straits of Gibraltar, which connects the Mediterranean with the Atlantic. The Middle East and North Africa region is particularly vulnerable, the report found, because it has the highest dependency on food imports in the world and is encircled by maritime bottlenecks. It also depends heavily on wheat imports from the Black Sea.In 2010, a , leading the government to impose an export ban. As a result, prices spiked in 2011 and this was a  conflicts. Other factors were important too, said Wellesley, but she said: ※At the start, it was about the price of bread.§The risks posed by the chokepoints is rising as the international trade in food is growing but also because of global warming, according to the report. It says  which can block chokepoints and also damage already ageing infrastructure. But it is also likely to , which can also shut down the bottlenecks.Other countries especially at risk from disruption are poorer nations reliant on imports such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Sudan, as well as richer nations like Japan and South Korea, according to the report. China is also a major importer but it has done the most to mitigate its exposure to chokepoint risk, the report found. It has diversified its supply routes, for example building a railway across South America to lessen reliance on the Panama canal. Chinese companies also own and operate ports around the world.The report recommends increased global cooperation to plan for food supply crises and more investment in crucial infrastructure. Wellesley said: ※The straits of Hormuz [which Iran has threatened to close] is a really interesting example of where the energy sector is sitting up and taking notice 每 the food sector should be doing the same. Those same countries that rely on Hormuz to export their oil rely almost entirely on the same strait for their food supply.§"																																																			
"The West Midlands is one of the worst hit areas outside the capital for illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution but many don＊t seem to realise they and their children are breathing some of the UK＊s most polluted air.The region is criss-crossed with motorways and dual carriageways churning out NO2 from hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles. The government＊s own figures show air pollution is responsible for almost  in the West Midlands and in 2015 Birmingham was one of five cities 每 alongside Leeds, Nottingham, Derby and Southampton 每 ordered to introduce a clean air zone by 2020. Today＊s study shows that the region contains five of the top 10 pollution hotspots outside  of nursery children to NO2. But despite this bleak picture there appears to be a lack of awareness among many of those living and working in some of the worst hit areas.In  there are 38 nurseries and 30 schools within 150 metres of a road where emissions of NO2 are above the legal limit. Of the 10 worst affected nurseries none were aware it was a problem when contacted by the Guardian. Proprietors and managers of the nurseries said air pollution was not something that they 每 or the parents 每 were aware of or discussed.James Burn, the Green party candidate for West Midlands mayor, said a lack of investment in public transport had resulted in ※terrible, hidden consequences§ across the region 每 with the young and poor suffering the most.※The West Midlands is facing an air pollution crisis 每 the shocking truth is that 3,000 people a year here die prematurely from breathing our dirty air,§ said Burn.He said the area had been the ※poor relation§ in terms of investment in public transport for decades.※For us to tackle this problem we need a huge investment from government to enable us to build a world-class public transport system that gets people from A to B without contributing to air pollution and congestion. Until that happens, we＊ll continue to see cars choking up our roads and our most vulnerable citizens choking on filthy air.§ Anne Shaw, Birmingham council＊s lead officer on air quality, is one of those tasked with tackling the problem. She said a lot of work was underway, but admitted it was a challenge to change people＊s attitudes to driving in a city that ※grew up on the car industry§.According to the council＊s own figures 900 people die from poor air quality in the city each year, compared to 30 from road accidents.※The car is ingrained into the people that live here and it is a challenge to change that.§However she said the council had a range of measures, from encouraging low emission vehicles to a revamped cycle network to help tackle the issue.※We are not anti-car, the car is still here, but there are 200,000 journeys of under a mile in this city each day 每 it is about removing some of those trips.§ "																																																			
" has warned his successor he does not intend to quit public life, declaring Australia needs ※strong liberal conservative voices now, more than ever§.The former prime minister used a speech to the Institute of Public Affairs on Tuesday to dust off  he first flagged in February, telling his audience: ※I will do my best to be a standard bearer for the values and the policies that have made us strong.§Abbott＊s latest intervention comes in the middle of an internal fight sparked by  over this past weekend, in which he signalled a win on marriage equality was imminent, and boasted about the influence of moderates within the government.Pyne＊s weekend indiscretion has prompted Malcolm Turnbull to dig in behind the marriage equality plebiscite,  to bring forward a private member＊s bill.Turnbull attempted to play down the latest internal divisions on Tuesday, characterising his party room as ※very harmonious, very united§.In Tuesday＊s speech Abbott invoked a Trumpism in reviving his conservative manifesto, arguing ※we need to make Australia work again§.In an effort to differentiate his policy inclinations from Turnbull＊s, Abbott rounded on the recent Finkel review of the national electricity market, which recommended the government adopt a clean energy target.Abbott said the only way to take pressure off power prices was to have a moratorium on new wind farms, stop any further subsidised renewable power and freeze the renewable energy target at 15%.He said any government ※serious about keeping the lights on§ would need a new coal-fired power station, even if that meant building one itself.Abbott also repeated calls for ※a big slowdown in immigration§ to allow new housing starts and infrastructure ※to catch up with population§.※Right now, a big slowdown in immigration would take the downward pressure off wages and the upward pressure off house prices,§ Abbott said. Hitting the pause button on migration would give ※harder-to-assimilate recent migrants more time to integrate with the wider Australian community before many more came in§.Abbott is clear that winding back the number of immigrants would trigger a political fight with Labor, which he considers a useful development, because it would ※just emphasise who＊s on Australians＊ side and who＊s not§.The former prime minister said the government needed to get the budget back under control, and the best way to do that was ※to avoid all new spending§, except for national security or economic infrastructure.He conceded it was ※probably necessary to guarantee that existing beneficiaries will keep their benefits§.Abbott said tough measures were required on national security. ※We not only have a right but a duty to defend our values and our way of life against those who would destroy them.※This means banning organisations that make excuses for terrorists, removing terrorist propaganda from the internet, and ensuring that known jihadis aren＊t free on our streets.§Abbott said the Coalition needed to reform the Senate to ensure governments were able to pass their programs, and to differentiate sharply from Labor. ※The next election won＊t be won by drawing closer to Labor,§ he said.※Sure, Bill Shorten can be painted as a union stooge who will put power prices through the roof, enshrine political correctness on steroids, and run the worst Labor government in our history,§ Abbott said. ※But you don＊t win elections by saying that the alternative would be worse; you win elections by being the best possible government.※The next election can only be won by drawing up new battlelines that give our people something to fight for, and the public something to hope for.§Abbott said Australia was ※a global success story§ after the Hawke and Howard governments, but things had since taken a turn for the worse.※Now, we can＊t even look across the Tasman without a twinge of acute embarrassment,§ Abbott said. ※We have an abundance of energy 每 but the world＊s highest power prices; an abundance of land 每 and property prices to rival Hong Kong＊s; some of the world＊s smartest people 每 yet with school rankings behind Kazakhstan.※We need to make Australia work again 每 because our country, plainly, is not working as it should.§"

" has declared the new clean energy target proposed by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, sounds like a ※magic pudding§ and he says the Coalition must not adopt a new tax on coal.Ahead of a discussion  by the Coalition party room on Tuesday, the former prime minister used his regular radio interview on 2GB to sound a warning about the reforms proposed by Finkel to the prime minister and the premiers last week.※My anxiety listening to reports of the [Finkel] report, and this statement [that] they are going to reward low-emissions fuels while not punishing high-emissions fuels, is [that] it is going to be a magic pudding,§ Abbott said on Monday.※If you are rewarding one type of energy, inevitably, the money has got to come from somewhere 每 either consumers or taxpayers.※If it is from consumers, it＊s effectively a tax on coal, and that is the last thing we want.§Abbott also said the Labor leader, , was favourite to win the next federal election. He said the Turnbull government needed to give ※our people§ something to fight for 每 and that should be ※lower power prices§.Referring to , Abbott said the Coalition in Australia could not afford to be complacent and  underscored the fact that ※big things turn on personal decisions§.The Abbott critique echoes scepticism from the Coalition＊s conservative wing about proposed changes to climate and energy policy, which has been on public display since Donald Trump  from the Paris climate treaty.The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has been  to convince his Coalition colleagues to support the proposed clean energy target on the basis that is it technology neutral and will provide lower power prices than if policy is left as it currently is.Frydenberg said on Sunday the new system was friendly to coal. ※We don＊t want to punish the existing coal generators because we want them to remain an important part of the energy mix going forward.§Business is pressing both the government and Labor to use the opportunity of the Finkel review to try to achieve a bipartisan position and end the decade-long climate wars. But Labor has signalled it cannot accept a clean energy target that includes coal.The Greens leader, , criticised the Finkel review on Monday, saying it would prevent Australia meeting its Paris targets.Di Natale dismissed suggestions he was setting the Greens up to make the same mistake they did in 2009, when their refusal to support Kevin Rudd＊s original emissions trading scheme guaranteed its downfall.Speaking on ABC radio on Monday, Di Natale said no one was more frustrated with the climate debate than him but Finkel＊s recommendations would not help Australia meet its 1.5C target set in Paris.※We＊ve got a huge challenge ahead of us ... and this does not deal with that challenge in the time frame that＊s required. If under this plan we follow it through to its logical conclusion, the reef＊s gone,§ he said.※The great tragedy here is if we lifted our level of ambition ... we would have a framework that allows us to drive the clean energy transition away from coal and gas.§Di Natale said he was not intent on making the perfect the enemy of the good. ※No, what we＊re doing is we＊re saying we＊ve got a climate crisis, we need to deal with dangerous climate change and we need a plan to deal with that.※There＊s no point having certainty if we lose the Great Barrier Reef, if we end up in a warming world where we see more extreme weather, heatwaves, cyclones, bushfires. ※That is the future that lies ahead of us, so we need to make this transition and make it rapidly.§Ross Garnaut 每 the architect of the 每 told the ABC on Monday the clean energy target proposed by Finkel was not as economically efficient as straightforward carbon pricing, or an emissions intensity scheme, but it was more efficient as a market mechanism than the renewable energy target.※In current circumstances, it＊s the only pricing mechanism that＊s got any chance of getting through the current parliament,§ he said. ※We need something through the current parliament because we need something when the RET runs out in 2020 to take us through to 2030 and I think we should get behind this mechanism because it can do the job.§He said recommendations relating to energy security in the report were ※very good, especially the requirement that new large-scale wind and solar in vulnerable regions should be required to provide grid stability services§.※The work on climate economics needs more work ＃ [because] if you read the Finkel report, it doesn＊t actually recommend targets, it leaves that open for discussion.§"																																																			
"A quarter of England＊s rivers are at risk of running dry, with devastating consequences for wildlife, according to data obtained by  under freedom of information rules.Fish are most obviously affected when rivers slow to a trickle, particularly those that migrate upstream such as salmon, trout, eels and lampreys. But animals such as water voles are also harmed, as they are unable to escape predators by fleeing into rivers to reach underwater entrances to their burrows. Birds such as kingfishers, sandpipers and dippers also suffer, as the insects and small fish they feed on die out.The rules governing how much water can be taken from rivers have not been updated for more than half a century and take no account of the water needed to sustain the ecological health of rivers. The government published proposed reforms in 2011 and had legislation drawn up early in 2017, but did not find parliamentary time to act.The driest October-to-March period for 20 years this year was followed by an  and , and has left much of Britain with low river and groundwater levels and facing the possibility of drought. The information released to WWF by the Environment Agency shows that in such conditions 23% of England＊s rivers could run dry. Further data shows that more than 550 rivers and lakes are in a poor ecological state because too much water is being taken from them.※The south-east of England received less rainfall over the winter than Menorca. If we have a dry summer, our green and pleasant land could become as parched as some of the Mediterranean,§ said Tanya Steele, chief executive of WWF. ※This may sound attractive for sun-seekers, but it would be disastrous for wildlife. But this can be avoided if we update the outdated way we manage the demand on our country＊s limited water supplies.§Many rivers around England have already suffered the effects of over-abstraction of water for agriculture and industry. Peter King, from the  in Sussex said: ※Twenty years ago you could swim along the Bevern stream 每 now you can literally walk across it all year round, as the water levels of the river Ouse have really gone down a lot. The problem is that the rivers have been so badly damaged over the past 50 years that they＊re now knackered.§ He said this also harmed the local economy: ※People who visited for canoeing, wildlife and fishing are not visiting anymore.§ England hosts most of the world＊s chalk streams but these are particularly vulnerable and half are now at risk of drying up, according to WWF. One is the river Chess, which flows through Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. Paul Jennings, a local farmer and chairman of the River Chess Association, said: ※In the last six years, it has been dry 50% of the time, and this has had devastating effects on the local people.§In September 2015, he said, thousands of fish were stranded in small pockets of water when the rest of the river dried up. The local community tried to rescue the fish by collecting them in buckets and moving them downstream, but were unsuccessful. Many rivers also suffer from sewage and agricultural pollution, with . Simon Ffennell, a horticulturalist who has lived on Hampshire＊s river Itchen all his life, said: ※The most noticeable change is the way that the sunny weather in spring combines with the high levels of phosphate and nitrate that is in the river and creates particular algae that is unfortunately smothering the river bed.§The problem of over-abstraction of water is exacerbated by the fact that demand for water can double during spells of dry and hot weather, as crops and gardens need more water and people take more showers.The Guardian revealed in May that, despite 20% of all piped water being lost to leaks, the level of . In June, Thames Water was fined a maximum ?8.5m for . Water waste rises to a third of all water taken from the natural environment when losses in treatment plants and in homes and businesses are included.The government＊s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), warned in 2016 that  in Britain, with even modest temperature rises leading to ※severe§ water shortages in England.Prof Ian Barker, from  and an adviser to the OECD, said: ※As the climate becomes more uncertain and extreme, and demand for water continues to rise, we need to find a better way to manage scarce water resources. But [UK] proposals to reform water management have been shelved.§A spokeswoman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ※We recognise the need to improve water management. That is why we are committed to reforming abstraction licensing into a simplified, modern system that is fairer and more resilient.§ She said the Environment Agency had made significant changes to more than 250 abstraction licences since 2008, saving 27bn litres of water a year being removed from the environment, enough to supply half a million people with water for one year."																																																			
"he fact that Naomi Klein predicted the forces that explain the rise to power of Donald Trump gives her no pleasure at all. It is 17 years since Klein, then aged 30, published her first book,  每 a seductive rage against the branding of public life by globalising corporations 每 and made herself, in the words of the , ※§ almost overnight. She ended the book with what sounded then like ※this crazy idea that you could become your own personal global brand§.Speaking about that idea now, she can only laugh at her former innocence.  was written before social media made personal branding second nature. Trump, she suggests in her new book, , exploited that phenomenon to become the first incarnation of president as a brand, doing to the US nation and to the planet what he had first practised on his big gold towers: plastering his name and everything it stands for all over them.Klein has also charted the other force at work behind the victory of the 45th president. Her 2007 book,  argued that neoliberal capitalism, the ideological love affair with free markets espoused by disciples of the late economist Milton Friedman, was so destructive of social bonds, and so beneficial to the 1% at the expense of the 99%, that a population would only countenance it when in a state of shock, following a crisis 每 a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, a war.Klein developed this theory first in 2004 when reporting from Baghdad and watching a brutally deregulated market state being imagined by agents of the Bush administration in the rubble of war and the fall of Saddam Hussein. She documented it too in the aftermath of the Boxing Day tsunami in Sri Lanka, when the inundated coastline of former fishing villages was parcelled up and sold off to global hotel chains in the name of regeneration. And she saw it most of all in the fallout of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, when, she argued, disaster was first ignored and exacerbated by government and then exploited for the gain of consultants and developers.Friedmanites understood that in extreme circumstances bewildered populations longed above all for a sense of control. They would willingly grant exceptional powers to anyone who promised certainty. They understood too that the combination of social media and 24-hour cable news allowed them to manufacture such scenarios almost at will. The libertarian right of the Republican party, in Klein＊s words, became ※a movement that prays for crisis the way drought-struck farmers pray for rain§.In 2008, the year after  was published, Klein believed that the financial crash would prove a reckoning for this cynical philosophy. That the ways in which the Wall Street elite had enriched itself through manipulation and deregulation would finally be exposed in plain sight. In retrospect, it seems, the monumental frailties of the system, its patent vulnerability, allied with concerns over terrorism and a global refugee crisis, only made populations more desperate and fearful. They appeared to crave anyone who could suggest simple solutions to apparently intractable problems. Anyone who said that they could turn back the clock to ※make America great again§ and who had the branded cap to prove it.For those of us who can＊t help looking at those events without turning lines from  over in our heads (※what rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?§), Klein＊s new book 每 which examines in detail both the phenomenon of Trump and how liberal and progressive forces might counter his reality 每 is a brilliant articulation of restless anxiety.Speaking at her home in Toronto last week, Klein suggested to me that Trump＊s novelty was to take the shock doctrine and make it a personal superpower. ※He keeps everyone all the time in a reactive state,§ she said. ※It is not like he is taking advantage of an external shock, he is the shock. And every 10 minutes he creates a new one. It is like he has these lasers coming out of his belt.§She wrote the book very fast, much faster than is her usual habit, because she feared that the further into a Trump administration America travels, the less scope there might be for resistance, for building an alternative. In this she believes that there are important precedents for people to understand.She points hopefully to the example of Spain in 2004, when after the Madrid train bombings the prime minister, Jos谷 Maria Aznar, announced that a state of emergency and special state powers were necessary. The people, remembering Franco, took to the streets to reject that analysis and , voting in a party that would pull Spanish troops out of Iraq. She is fully aware, too, of the alternative in Turkish president Recip Tayyip Erdo?an＊s successful plea for dictatorial powers following the chaos of the failed coup in 2016. Klein＊s book sets out those examples in advance of any comparable shock in America, and makes the case for collective resistance in the event of crisis. ※I hope none of it happens [in the States] and none of it is useful,§ she says, ※but just in case, I wanted to have it out there as soon as possible.§The daughter of American parents, Klein lives in Toronto with dual citizenship. When she thought about putting her book together, her original plan was for an anthology of articles threaded together with interviews, but once she started analysing the presidency she kept writing in a kind of frenzy. One of the benefits of having a deadline and an all-consuming project was that it meant she was forced to use the blocking app Freedom to protect her from the distraction of the internet. ※I think if I hadn＊t written this book I just would have stared at Twitter like many others for months on end, watching it unfold, and writing snippy things at people.§That tendency among Trump＊s critics, she says, is a symptom of his banal influence. She devotes one section of her book to the notion that through Twitter Trump is making the political sphere in his own image and that ※we all have to kill our inner Trump§. Among other things, she says, the president ※is the embodiment of our splintered attention spans§. One essential ingredient of resistance, she suggests, is to retain a belief in telling and understanding complex stories, keeping faith with narrative.One of the questions that Klein＊s book does not reach a conclusion about is how conscious Trump is of his shock doctrine tactics. Is he a demagogue in the scheming manner of Putin and Erdo?an, or just a useful idiot for the forces around him?※I think he is a showman and that he is aware of the way that shows can distract people,§ she says. ※That is the story of his business. He has always understood that he could distract his investors and bankers, his tenants, his clients from the underlying unsoundness of his business, just by putting on the Trump show. That is the core of Trump. He is undoubtedly an idiot, but do not underestimate how good he is at that.§Beyond that he has, presumably wittingly, ※surrounded himself with some of the world＊s most expert crisis profiteers§. Men who have made billions out of meltdown and financial crisis, such as Wilbur Ross, the ※king of bankruptcy§ who is now secretary of commerce, or the various crash-plutocrats recruited from Goldman Sachs and elsewhere. (※In any other moment,§ Klein says with a laugh, ※the very fact that the CEO of Exxon Mobil is now the secretary of state would be the central scandal. Here we have a situation where there is so much else to concern us it is barely a footnote.§)Klein＊s book on Trump comes garlanded with quotes from just about every notable leftwing intellectual celebrity you can think of. Noam Chomsky calls it ※urgent, timely, and necessary§. Yanis Varoufakis describes it as ※a manual for emancipation by means of the only weapon we have against orchestrated misanthropy: constructive disobedience§. Michael Stipe, meanwhile, asks: ※Who better than Naomi to make sense of this madness, and help us find a way out?§Does she recognise the danger that she is preaching only to the converted, and further entrenching our polarised politics?She obviously hopes that is not the case, pointing to the parts of the book in which she criticises Hillary Clinton and Obama and (even) Bernie Sanders for failing to connect effectively enough to the lives of the left-behind. Her overriding anxiety is that while the liberal left wrings its hands over the ways that the US election was lost, and gets embroiled in Russian conspiracy theories, not enough attention is being paid to the conspiracy happening in plain sight: the dangers of kleptocracy, and the broken promises to the working class.※I am not saying Russia is not important,§ she says, ※but Trump＊s base is very well defended against that: ＆the liberal media is out to get him＊, ＆it＊s fake news＊, and all the rest.§ While we are all clicking and fixing our eyes on the never-ending Trump show 每 the handshake with Macron, the hand-holding with May 每 he is, she argues, enacting policies that are systematically moving wealth upwards, and crucial questions are not being asked loudly enough: Is your social security safe? Is your healthcare safe? Are your wages going to be driven down? ※He benefits so much from that focus away from economics.§Klein has not been surprised how, at a time of economic downturn and mass migration, nationalism has once again proved such a potent force in successive elections in the west. She makes the argument that the only thing that can rival those forces of white nationalism and xenophobia is a justice-based economic populism on the left. What Hillary Clinton＊s campaign proved, she suggests, is that when you run a centrist free-market candidate against ※fake populism§ it＊s a recipe for disaster.Doesn＊t the election of Macron in France prove that pragmatic centrism is still a viable force if the right candidate emerges to express it?Klein believes the jury is out on that question. ※The fact is Le Pen did better in that election than she ever should have. I think the issue is what happens if Macron governs with the kind of austerity that has fuelled these forces, and his shine wears off? What happens the next time around?§ The analogy that Le Pen equals  is not exact, she says. ※It is more Le Pen equals David Duke [former leader of the Ku Klux Klan]. If David Duke got the percentage of the vote that Le Pen got, we would be terrified, as well we should be.§Klein welcomes the emergence of unashamedly leftwing candidates, with an ability to inspire enthusiasm, particularly among the young. She points to the nostalgic socialism of Sanders, Jean-Luc M谷lenchon and Jeremy Corbyn as evidence of this. But don＊t they look more like the past than the future?※I don＊t think any of these guys figured it out,§ she says. ※But we should think about the fact that M谷lenchon could get 70,000 people at a rally from nowhere, and look at the surge we have seen with Corbyn. Especially given the fact that he is kind of the exact opposite of a charismatic politician.§ (Once the result was known, Klein emailed to say: ※The UK election really showed the power of leading with substance and ideas, rather than slick packaging and fear. The more May tried to exploit people＊s fear and shock 每 telling them they might need to give up their privacy and human rights to fight terror, that they should delegate their rights to her 每 the more [Corbyn＊s] message of hope, that positive ＆yes＊ looked like the better option to many people.§)In this sense, Klein places a lot of faith in the cyclical nature of cynicism and hope, believing that the generation now in its teens and 20s is much less phobic of electoral politics than her generation ever was. She experienced a version of that cycle in her own growing up. She was in many ways born to protest, the third Klein generation of principled resistance.It began with her paternal grandparents, Anne and Philip, who met as communists in Newark, New Jersey, in the 1930s. Philip was an animator for Walt Disney. He organised a strike at the studios during the making of  and was fired as a result. He went to work in a shipyard, before he and his wife became part of the nascent green movement, living at the Nature Friends retreat in Paterson, New Jersey, tending their vegetables, listening to Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie.Klein＊s parents took that retreat from American life a stage further by moving to Canada, in part in protest over the Vietnam war. Her father worked as a paediatrician in public hospitals. Her mother, Bonnie, a film-maker, helped to create the feminist film collective Studio D and made documentaries about Greenham Common and a polemical film against pornography.Klein has recalled how she rebelled against her radical upbringing, insisting on makeup and pop culture; how she always resented being dragged along to peace marches and demonstrations, or what she later called ※another poncho picnic§. She was for most of her teens dismissive of her mother＊s feminism. She credits two particular catastrophic events in changing her mind. First, aged 46, her mother suffered a brain tumour and a series of strokes that left her quadriplegic. Klein helped to nurse her for six months and was inspired by the fortitude and spirit her mother showed in her partial rehabilitation, and the strength she discovered in herself. At around the same time, during her first year at the University of Toronto, a , declaring: ※I hate feminists.§ The event motivated Klein into political activism and she has called herself a feminist ever since, though initially she was sceptical of conventional party politics.※Among my generation there was a purist position that any contact with electoral politics was an unforgiveable compromise,§ she says. ※I don＊t see that nearly so much in this generation. Part of it is based in movement building but it also involves running people for office at every level.§She hesitates to suggest her book as a rallying cry for a political party 每 she is wary of making herself anything like a figurehead, hoping to be ※one voice among many§ 每 but suggests that there are ideas in it that people might gather around. She is doing a series of (inevitably sold-out) events across the US to support the book, though she says: ※I have a five-year-old son so I won＊t be permanently on the road.§The part she hopes will most resonate with her audiences is the ※Leap§ manifesto 每 ※an integrated leap forward on climate action, racial justice, decent jobs§. She has created Leap with her husband, Avi Lewis, a documentary film-maker, in conjunction with various activist groups 每 ※heads of labour federations and unions, directors of major green groups, iconic indigenous and feminist leaders, key organisers and theorists focused on migrant rights, open technology, food justice, housing, faith, and more＃§ from across Canada and beyond. The ideas are an extension of the theme of her last book, , which argued that a new progressive politics had to be built around a radical and sustainable green tech revolution, and an outright rejection of fossil fuels.The proactive message is at least as important as her deconstruction of Trump, she hopes. ※When I wrote  I really did think that just showing how crisis was exploited would be enough to repel it,§ she says. ※Then the crash happened and I watched these social movements fill squares in Portugal and Italy and Spain 每 I lived there for months 每 all chanting ＆We won＊t pay for your crisis＊. I ended  with an interview I had with Alexis Tsipras before he was elected in Greece, where he said to me ＆It is enough in this moment to say no.＊§Klein profoundly disagreed, because ※no is never enough§. Anger and rejection of the status quo will never sustain people on its own. ※The triumph of neoliberalism is the idea that the alternative is always even worse. To overturn that there has to be a boldness and a recapturing of the utopian imagination. If we can＊t do that, then I really don＊t think we have a chance against these guys.§Klein ends her current book talking about these movements that have spontaneously expressed resistance 每 Black Lives Matter, various green and community groups 每 and argues for them to come together. ※To resist this we have get out of the silos,§ she says. ※Environmentalists in one corner, feminists in one corner, racial justice in another. We don＊t have enough spaces where we can get together.§In expressing this hope, Klein references the example of her mother＊s stroke and the ways that devastating event shaped her understanding of coping with crisis. She takes it as an example that sudden adversity generates strength and hope as well fear. ※In a shocked state, with our understanding of the world badly shaken, a great many of us can become childlike and passive, and overly trusting of people who are only too happy to abuse that trust. But I also know, from my own family＊s navigation of a shocking event, that there can be the inverse response as well. We can evolve and grow up in a crisis, and set aside all kinds of bullshit 每 fast.§※My mother＊s stroke was a really formative moment in my life,§ she says. ※And I think because of it I have been attuned to seeing other expressions of that. When I started to write about crisis in , it was with a sense that these moments of trauma could bring out the best in people.§We talk a little about how the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London have again exemplified that fact. How, contrary to the efforts of forces that might have exaggerated the fear and exploited the crisis to divide us, they became occasions to reaffirm tremendous shared humanity and spirit. One aspect of that, I suggest, is that at heart, people aren＊t made to be fearful all the time, life reasserts itself.※The thing about the shock doctrine is that if they try to use it too much it stops being shocking,§ Klein says. ※That is the importance of historical memory in these moments 每 and of course Britain has the blitz spirit in its DNA: we are people who do not crumble during crisis.One of the difficulties that America faces, she suggests, is that it doesn＊t have that kind of collective memory. Historical struggles that the nation has overcome 每 Jim Crow and civil rights, the internment of Japanese Americans during the second world war 每 have not been shared narratives, and therefore have been harder to unite around.She hopes that a shared investment in the environment can provide some of that social glue; in this respect, Trump＊s rejection of the Paris Accord can be a starting pistol for . The cities and provinces that have pledged to abide by the Paris principles prove the limits of central power. ※The message is that neoliberals control a lot but they don＊t control everything. They don＊t decide how we get our energy or move ourselves. Part of breaking the spell of neoliberalism is having people live an alternative, and cities and communities are where that happens. The institutions that used to be the backbone of social movements are in disarray and so diminished, and so we need to fix it for ourselves.§In this sense she envisages her Leap idea as a piece of open source code: ※If you make activism a brand, you are in competition with similar brands, doing similar work,§ she says. ※With Leap, if you want it, take it, do something cool with it, if you don＊t want it, who cares?§How optimistic is she about that prospect?※I have good days and bad days,§ she says. ※Or good parts of days and bad parts of days. It is undeniably terrifying that at this moment of such intense gravity for the planet this figure of such extreme stupidity has risen to power. But that means that there is more urgency to find solutions.§ She laughs. ※Will that do as my message of hope?§ she asks.I guess it will for now, I say."																																																			
"here have the ravens on Raven Crag gone? I ask, puzzled, scrutinising the baby Matterhorn on Fleetwith Pike from Gatesgarth Farm at the head of Buttermere. ※Honister Crag is where,§ answers Willie Richardson. ※Oh, and Haystacks,§ the retired shepherd adds, nodding towards the fells opposite the dale head, which always make me think of Monet＊s haystacks. That＊s local knowledge for you (the farm had been his home for 59 years).He reckons that sparrowhawks are nesting in a holly bush on the rock-face, scaring off the birds that gave the crag its name.There are no chaffinches at the bird feeders above Gatesgarth cottage＊s flowerbeds today, either. And no blue tits pecking at cobwebs for spiders. They know that predators are in the vicinity, he says. like black-headed robins suddenly rise from the lowest flanks of Robinson, amid a cacophony of yelping. ※Game on!§ Willie says, binoculars raised. ※Gatesgarth hound trail. They＊ve just slipped them off their leads.§Twenty trailhounds, similar to foxhounds but bred for speed and hooked on scenting aniseed, stream across the hillside. They bounce over the sieves (as rushes are known here), noses to the ground. ※Drive up Honister,§ says Willie, ※and take your photos before they contour around Fleetwith and Haystacks and race hell for leather back to the finish near here.§Further up the pass a man with a red flag stops traffic to allow the hounds across the road, in hot pursuit of the whiff of aniseed oil that had been laid for them.※Hey!§ yells a van driver, pointing accusingly, as sheep scatter on seeing the dogs. ※Hey, nothing,§ retorts the flag man. ※That＊s not sheep worrying. Those ＆sheep＊ are hoggs, just 12 months old. Only big lambs, really, and easily spooked. They ken hound trailing＊s a game. If a trailhound touches any sheep, a vet puts it down.§As the dogs pass below the white cross commemorating young Fanny Mercer who accidentally  here in 1887, I spare a thought too for fledgling ravens slaughtered by sparrowhawks."																																																			
"t was just before 10pm when I spotted the first vivid green spark in the understorey 每 a female common . She had climbed a tall blade of grass and was advertising her availability to males on the wing, curling her abdomen to show off the bioluminescent rear segments to their best effect.The ethereal illumination 每 which can also act as a  每 is generated within the glow-worm＊s light-producing organ, known as the lantern. A  occurs between oxygen, the light-emitting compound luciferin, an energy-transporting molecule called adenosine triphosphate, and the enzyme luciferase. At the end of the Ghost＊s speech in the first act of Hamlet, Shakespeare writes: ※The glow-worm shows the matin to be near/ And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.§ Uneffectual, indeed: it is an astonishingly efficient process, with 98% of the energy input to the reaction emitted as ※cold§ light. Compare that with an incandescent lightbulb, where 90% of the energy used is lost as heat.For a closer look I picked up the glow-worm (ently grasping her between finger and thumb. She was just under 2cm long and looked like an elongated woodlouse. I was surprised by the marshmallow softness of her body, which was quite unlike the shell-like exoskeletons of other beetles.By the time we had returned to the car park we had counted 14 displaying females. Some of them were mating, with the smaller, dull-brown, hard wing-cased males clinging to their backs. The status of the  is poorly documented, but there is evidence to suggest population decline. The flightless females don＊t move more than a metre or two in their adult life, so habitat fragmentation or loss of chalk grassland and hedgerows poses a threat, while increased light pollution disrupts mating behaviour, with males sometimes being attracted to street lamps instead of females. I found another female glowing on the mown verge in front of my car. As the headlights flared, her lamp faded like a torch with dying batteries. Living in a perpetual blaze of artificial light and rarely venturing along unlit country paths at night, it is perhaps unsurprising that most people are oblivious of the presence of these radiant insects.

"An ambitious target to phase out sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 could halve UK oil imports, a study by environmental and aid organisations suggests. as part of its efforts to tackle air pollution and climate change, a move the groups welcomed as a step in the right direction.But a stronger ambition for all new cars and vans to produce zero emissions by 2030 could reduce UK foreign oil imports by 51% in 2035 compared to current projections, as well as cut pollution and boost investment in UK infrastructure such as charging points.The report by Green Alliance and supported by Cafod, Christian Aid, Greenpeace, RSPB and WWF, comes ahead of the government＊s publication of the clean growth plan, which will outline how the UK will cut carbon emissions to meet legal targets.Ministers have signalled that the delayed plan will be published after parliament＊s summer recess, and the aim is for it to be ※as ambitious, robust and clear a blueprint as it can be§.In 2016, transport accounted for 40% of the UK＊s total energy consumption, with road transport accounting for three-quarters of this, but other countries such as Norway and India are ahead of the UK in their ambitions to switch to electric vehicles, the new study said.Along with a tougher target to make the move to zero emission vehicles, the study calls for additional funding for renewables between 2020 and 2025, bringing in zero-carbon standards for new homes and building energy efficiency improvements.Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate and energy at WWF, said the UK could and must go faster than the 2040 goal.※To ensure the UK doesn＊t miss out on the jobs and investment opportunity in clean, modern vehicles, the UK should up its ambition. Cleaning up transport and boosting home energy efficiency must be priorities for the UK government in the forthcoming clean growth plan.※Both measures will create jobs for UK businesses and reduce costs to the NHS caused by noxious air pollution and cold, leaky homes,§ he said.Laura Taylor, head of advocacy at Christian Aid, said: ※The UK government＊s long-overdue clean growth plan needs to prove that this government is serious about speeding up the low carbon transition, not slackening the pace.※The benefits to citizens are enormous but areas like home energy efficiency and heating are lagging behind and need urgent political attention.§"																																																			
"ere is a beaver-based creation myth. It begins thus. God so loved the world that He seeded it with diligent rodents able to do the hard work of habitat creation 每 damming streams and creating ponds and lakes in which amphibian larvae thrived, providing food for water beetles and dragonfly nymphs and a host of other invertebrates which fed the fish that early humans consumed. God gave us beavers to make the landscapes upon which we depended 每 that＊s the myth I want you to imagine for the sake of this piece.It goes on. My creation myth believes that the wetlands that these early creatures created washed away and purified humanity＊s poisons. And that these holy creatures, The Beavers, saved us from Biblical floods by slowing the flow rate of sudden aggregations of water. Again and again, The Beavers saved us, but in time, predictably, things changed. We humans came to turn our backs on them. We forgot about Beavers, and God was not pleased about humankind＊s insolence.Like all good creation myths, this one features a gruesome twist. Like the rosy apple that hung from the tree in the Garden of Eden, in my creation myth God put things on beavers to tempt those first people into sinning. He covered them with thick fur that they would desire as clothing. He put their testicles on the inside, rather than the outside, and gave these mystical and elusive gonads properties that may (or may not) have provided . And, lastly, there beneath their tails, God hung a pair of anal glands that produced a  that the early humans found irresistible. Those early humans made a choice. They couldn＊t help themselves. They committed original sin.Upon discovering their unusual glands and delightfully thick fur we humans slaughtered them in their millions to make top hats and well-known perfumes that still sell today courtesy of a deft hint of anal glands that makes them more appealing than the competition. (Also ice-cream flavouring, ). The rest, as they say, is history.In less than 200 years, the North American beaver went from 90 million to between 10-15 million. In Europe and Asia, just 1,200 beavers remained by 1900. The beavers died, almost totally exterminated. In time, we forgot that they had ever been here.Like all creation myths, mine would become superseded in time by fact. For we discovered there was a better way to describe the patterns in nature that we see around us. We noticed evolution and we determined the mechanism through which it happened: natural selection. And so we must come back to reality and the crux of this Google question, posed above. The big question then, if you will, is this: if it wasn＊t for humankind＊s benefit, why exactly do beavers build dams?The simple answer is that beavers build dams to deepen watercourses, so that they can create ※lodges§ that can be better defended from modern predators including bears, wildcats, otters and other mammalian forebears with whom the beavers shared prehistory. It seems that deep water is particularly important to beavers. Lakes and ponds allow for a kind of floating structure of sticks and branches that can be accessed from a secret hole beneath, a key real-estate feature that reduces the need for terrestrial entrances through which land-based predators can climb. Upon finding shallow watercourses, colonising beavers immediately begin damming, creating canals along which trunks and branches can be dragged along to add to this, their anti-predator superstructure. In these lodges, beavers rear their young and see out winter, safe and sound.Why and how they hit upon this behaviour is of interest to those who study beavers and their family members, the  (nearly all of whom are now extinct). It may be an example of a behavioural trait that has ※piggy-backed§ upon an appetite for bark-gnawing. One imagines that their semi-aquatic ancestors were tree-gnawers that used their spoils for building riverside burrows, with some accidentally hitting upon damming rivers. The truth is we don＊t yet know. The creation myth eroded, now a new mystery is being gradually exposed based by those that study comparative anatomy, fossils and DNA.One thing is clear. Our original sins now washed away by rushing floodwaters, we have an opportunity to bring beavers back into our lives. In recent years, almost every European country has made steps to re-introduce and restore their wild beaver populations. In Scotland, an introduced population of beavers is doing well 每 indeed, it is now considered a . There is a good chance that a  may be granted the same status.After almost killing them off entirely, we may yet redeem ourselves from the sins of our ancestors. How delicious, therefore, that we should free ourselves from damnation by becoming, once more, a dam-nation.

"omeone writes a memo about his views on . Apparently women are in tears, too traumatised to go to work. A baker  and my Twitter feed practically bursts into flames. ※HOW CAN THIS BE HAPPENING?!§But mention the climate crisis, something that is smashing temperature records, raising sea levels, driving diseases into places they＊ve not been before, and which may lead, as Professor Stephen Hawking suggests, to a need for the human race to , and there＊s radio silence. You can almost see the digital tumbleweed.Nearly 30 years after Nasa＊s  testified before a US Senate committee that human activity was warming the planet and must be stopped, it seems the issue does not stir the general population.

After all, this is an issue of science and survival and we all have the same to lose. But in my experience, many on the left who should care more about climate change just don＊t. People who are extremely vocal about homophobia, transphobia, racism and sexism seem to have a blind spot. Which is odd because in the coming decades, all those problems (and more) will be supersized.Peter Tatchell has long warned that tolerance does not always survive periods of social turbulence.

"onald Trump＊s decision to pull the US out of the historic  and turn his back on the other 194 countries that signed it leaves him isolated on the world stage. But Trump is also isolated from the very Americans he purports to lead, and here lies hope.Across America, families, businesses, churches, institutions and governments are busy building a clean energy future. And no president can stop that.When he announced he was pulling the US out of the Paris Accord, Trump : ※I was elected to represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris.§ And that  to join other American mayors 每 more than 100 so far 每 in affirming his city＊s commitment to move to 100% renewable energy. This reflects the fact that the people of Pittsburgh 每 and Philadelphia and Phoenix and Salt Lake City and towns and rural areas across America 每 want clean energy in their backyards. In liberal areas and conservative ones, Americans are transforming the way they power their lives as we move to 100% clean energy for all.Consider Buffalo, in upstate New York. Once an industrial powerhouse dotted with manufacturing and steel mill factories, it lost half its population in the second half of the 20th century and became the third-poorest big city in the United States. It is home to exactly the kind of ※forgotten§ people Trump talked about on the campaign trail. In a city featuring old houses and tough winters, heating bills regularly cost more than rent for some. But in a once blighted area on the West Side, hundreds of residents are working with Push Buffalo 每 an organization Rahwa helps run 每 to weatherproof homes, install solar energy systems and build a stronger community, all while training local residents for good jobs in the emerging green economy.On the other side of the country, California＊s Asian Pacific Environmental Network organized in eight different languages, from Korean to Cantonese, to secure $2bn for solar development in low-income housing projects. And in South Los Angeles, a community group called Strategic Concepts in Organizing and Policy Education 每 Scope 每 is helping black, Latino and low-income communities of color take advantage of economic and job opportunities in the growing clean-energy economy.But it＊s not just city communities that are building a clean energy future that has the power to blunt the worst effects of climate change. So are rural American states, including states whose people voted for Trump.  produced over 36% of its electricity from wind power last year 每 a bigger share than any other state.  gets almost 70% of its electricity from water and wind. In , wind energy has grown from less than 1% of the state＊s electricity generation in 2005 to 24% in 2015.American businesses get it, too. Just ask, whose South Carolina airplane factory is powered by 100% renewable energy.  and other major US corporations are major customers for renewable power.In our work with the Solutions Project and Push Buffalo, we have seen how clean and efficient energy projects are everywhere, from universities to churches, from factories to farms and from military bases to shopping malls.Combatting climate change is an important motivation for many of these efforts. But we＊ve seen that even Americans who don＊t ※believe§ in climate change are embracing renewable energy. Some of them value cleaner air; others value energy independence and national security and others are called to care for creation.Simplifying it all is the economics: as renewables become as affordable as fossil fuels 每 and even more affordable 每 they become more common, and economies of scale make them cheaper still.And people in America are not only embracing these lower bills. They are embracing community ownership of renewable energy infrastructure, creating good local jobs and building local wealth. Their vision is to transform America＊s energy economy from a draining and extractive model to a regenerative and sustainable model that makes communities 每 and the nation 每 stronger.Time and again, Donald Trump has promised to help forgotten, hard-hit Americans. But trying to hold back the rising tide of clean energy will not help them 每 and it won＊t work, anyway.

"n the Crown Hotel in Lynton, they tell a gruesome tale about . One June night in 1995, a chef, raging drunk, snatched up a meat cleaver and, announcing he was going to kill someone, vanished into the night. Early next morning, on the clifftop path that leads from the north Devon village to the valley, a dog-walker came upon a 300-yard trail of blood. A murder inquiry was launched, the scene was taped off, forensics tents erected and samples sent away for analysis.The Valley of Rocks is one of those incongruous corners of rural England that seem immune to time＊s passage. This is partly down to its sheer seclusion, pressed between the expanse of Exmoor to the south and the Bristol Channel to the north. Half a mile east is Lynton and, on the coast 500ft below, the village of Lynmouth, with its memorial museum to the .It is summer, but the drizzle is implacable and the ridges on either side are cloaked in fog. Yet my guide, Rupert Kirby, barely slows down even when negotiating the sandstone spine of Castle Rock, with the waves crashing 450ft below (he＊s a young 54). He stops and raises his camera: 20ft ahead, a small horned form hobbles out of the mist and on to a boulder. It emits a little bleat.When he isn＊t driving lorries for Jewson, Kirby runs . This morning, we＊re looking for billies, though there are few if any left in the valley.※One was always aware that there were tensions,§ Kirby says (he＊s well-spoken, and trained as a viola player). ※The Facebook group was intended as a forum where the different factions could meet on middle ground.§He＊s wondering if the animal up ahead is a young billy, but when we get closer, the shape of its horns indicates it＊s a female. With another bleat, she＊s gone into the mist.※The situation certainly isn＊t as extreme as it was,§ Kirby adds as we edge down a scree slope to the car park. ※People getting death threats, and so on.§He suggests I listen to a recording of , a Radio 4 show in which, each week, the comedian visits a different British community and encourages his audience to laugh at its own parochialisms. In March, Steel visited Lynton and asked the crowd about the feral goats that inhabit the Valley of Rocks 每 who was for them and who against, he wanted to know. The fors are vocal enough, but when it comes to the opposing camp, the roar of loathing sits uneasily with the light-hearted tone of the show. Three times someone bellows, ※Shoot the lot!§To understand the vitriol, a good place to start is Lynton＊s cemetery, situated between the valley and the village. Of the 34 victims of the 1952 Lynmouth flood, 13 are buried here. What stands out are the steel cages surrounding each floral tribute. When the popular matriarch of a local farming family was buried a few years ago, the bier＊s wheels became clogged with dung and the wreaths left on her grave vanished no sooner than the funeral party had gone.※You can leave daffodils, but that＊s about it,§ , tells me (daffodils being poisonous). Even plastic flowers get eaten down to the stalks. Quite apart from the cemetery, she adds, for a village whose economy relies almost entirely on tourism, the soiled pavements, the guesthouse gardens lain waste and the reek of billies in rut are not trivial concerns. ※We＊ve only got tourism,§ Hibbert says. ※We haven＊t got anything else.§ When I ask the woman running  about the discord surrounding the goats＊ management, she says, ※Don＊t talk to me about the goat wars.§In 2005, the council erected a 6ft stock fence across the end of the valley closest to the village. It extends right to the sea down a near-vertical slope, but at low tide, the goats 每 being goats 每 can simply clamber down to the exposed foreshore and file into Lynmouth. When ?40,000 was spent installing cattle grids on the lane through the valley, it was only a matter of days before the goats were tiptoeing across the bars.Back in 1995, before the blood could be analysed or the chef apprehended, the then mayor came forward with some information. ※The police are aware, or should be aware, that goat culling goes on,§ he told the North Devon Journal＊s Cathy Newman (, but at this time on work experience). It was the first clue to the real source of the blood: the shooting of a goat by a council marksman. The chef, it turned out, had simply gone home to bed after his tirade.Various factions have tended to agree that the goats must be managed, but how 每 whether by rehoming, or killing, or contraception 每 has been a point of rancour for years, to the extent that, at one point, a photo of Mayor Hibbert was displayed in a shop window daubed in red paint, and one of her council colleagues received anonymous threats directed at his grandchildren. The invective hasn＊t been one-sided, either: one pro-goat campaigner I spoke to recently received a phone call so threatening, she reported it to the police.In 1997, two years after the aborted murder enquiry, half of the 100 or so goats then living in the valley vanished almost overnight. An invoice came to light showing that the council had arranged for 40 of the animals to be killed. It was this incident that prompted Ray Werner and others to set up .The day before going to Devon, I meet Werner at a city farm in Wimbledon, south London, where we speak over the horns of a  named Basil. An authority on British native goats, Werner has spent more than 40 years observing the Lynton herd. His interest in goats goes back to a period of sickness as a child in Germany, when, bedridden and delirious, he became obsessed with the pictures of goats in . ※I was off up the mountain with Heidi and the herd,§ he remembers.Goats are recorded in the manor of ※Lyntonia§ as far back as the Domesday book, but their presence in the Valley of Rocks has been intermittent since the mid-19th century. ※There＊s a story that if the goats ever leave the Valley of Rocks, bad luck will befall the village,§ Werner says. ※Every time the council wanted to get rid of them, they were scared to do it, because they didn＊t want to be blamed for an avalanche, or Russia invading north Devon.§The current herd can be traced to 1976, when three goats were transferred to the valley from a feral herd in the Cheviot hills of Northumberland. (※Feral§ refers simply to a domesticated animal that has become self-sufficient in the wild.) Werner recently proved that the Cheviot goat is genetically identical to the rare old English goat, whose ancestors were introduced some 5,000 years ago. In appearance, the Cheviot shares characteristics with the semi-feral Exmoor pony: bulky, short-legged, with small ears and a thick, shabby coat.Over time, the presence of dairy goats already in the Valley of Rocks, along with unwanted animals dumped there subsequently, led to a crossbreed herd. It＊s partly this genetic dilution, Werner believes, that has caused the conflict with the human population. The original Cheviot goats, being hardier and having had little communication with people, were less likely to enter the village or bully picnickers.In 1983, Lynton and Lynmouth town council appointed Werner keeper of the goats, an unofficial role that entailed his visiting the valley six times a year from his home in London, studying the herd and advising the council on management. His ambition was to restore the herd to its 1976 genetic purity by selective breeding and the removal of crossbreeds, but in the end his efforts were for nothing. ※The council would panic while I was away, and do something silly that would disrupt the work: arrange for the goats to be shot or carted off. It was as if they were wearing blinkers.§Today, the herd is more mixed than ever.A few years ago, Werner had a call from the police in Barnstaple: one of his goats was trotting around the square, evading capture. Barnstaple is 18 miles across the moor. ※It turned out the council had rounded up some of the goats behind our backs and taken them on a lorry to the abattoir, and one of them had escaped,§ he says. ※Joyce got him back. Good old Joyce. If the SAS had turned up, she would have faced them down.§***※The sad fact is,§ Joyce Salter says, ※the billies are pretty good at trashing the village. But it＊s not their fault they＊ve got a larder on the doorstep.§ Joyce and her husband Eric moved to the area in 1993, and cofounded the Lynton Feral Goat Preservation Society with Ray Werner in 1997. Both worked in the public sector before retiring; Joyce in the library service and Eric as a bus driver.Their priority, Joyce says, has always been the animals＊ welfare. ※The problem is, there＊s been a long period of appalling management, and some kind of＃§ She pauses and glances at Eric. In 2002, they left the area for Cornwall, partly because of all the acrimony. The worst of it was during  the previous year, when the area＊s footpaths were closed to prevent walkers from spreading the disease to livestock. Lynton and Lynmouth＊s struggling tourism providers campaigned for the goats to be removed, alive or dead, so the paths through the valley could be reopened. When Joyce presented a paper at a council meeting opposing the measure, she began receiving what she calls ※hate mail§. In the end, the valley stayed open, the goats survived and the immediate area was spared infection (even if tourism all but dried up); but the resentments lingered.Feral goats will keep to a discrete home range, provided they feel safe and have dry bedding, fresh water and a range of nutrients (in the Valley of Rocks, these are gorse, heather, bark, grass and flowering plants). They＊ll stray only if deprived of those things due to environmental or population pressures. In Lynton, as well as eating flowers and bark on trees on the edge of the village, the goats have often been found sheltering under porches (they hate rain) and drinking from the public toilets.※We even took a water trough to the valley for them,§ Joyce says.※Someone contaminated it,§ Eric adds. ※With a dead owl.§Having returned only three years ago, partly for the goats, and partly to be close to their burial plot in the cemetery, Joyce is wary of reviving dormant enmities. ※We always called it the secret agenda. There was something going on, which nobody ever got to the bottom of: whether it was trophy-hunting; whether it was supplying meat for the hunt dogs.§The incident with the dead owl is not the last suspected attempt to harm the goats. A few years ago, a walker found a heap of sweet peppers left under a shelter in the valley. Noticing a quantity of blue grains packed into each one, she reported the discovery. Analysis by Defra identified the substance as a mixture of caustic soda and rat poison.After that, the goats kept out of the local press, until March this year, when Hibbert＊s deputy, Tony Meakin, received a visit from the police.Since his appointment last year, Meakin has assumed responsibility for managing the goats on the council＊s behalf. (He has also done a stint as mayor.) He and his wife, Linda, retired to the village eight years ago, having lived in South Africa for 39 years. ※I had hunting rifles in South Africa,§ he says, ※so I＊m used to using weapons. And I＊m handy.§The grounds of Meakin＊s house afford views over both the village to the north and the Valley of Rocks to the west, a good surveillance point for monitoring the goats＊ movements. We are sitting in his conservatory drinking coffee as the rain patters on the roof.One of the duties Meakin has taken on personally is to euthanise sick or injured animals. ※Last year, eight kids were killed by dogs,§ he says. ※One got its back broken. The lady came to our gate in tears. She had this tiny little dog, and she said the dog was always so well behaved. The only thing I could do was bring the kid back here and put it down.§The incident with the police still rankles. He＊d had reports of a lame goat on the football pitch. ※My gun was in the back of the Freelander. I got out of the vehicle, locked it, and went up towards the football pitch, and I saw some youths coming up the street. I thought, from a safety point of view, I＊m not leaving my firearm in the car.§Once he＊d collected his rifle and the teenagers had gone on their way, he was confronted by an irate villager, who, having yelled at him to ※leave the goats alone§, promptly called the police to report an armed male prowling the village. (Meakin＊s gun licence entitles him to carry a firearm on council property, and no charges were brought.)Although they are feral, and therefore owned by nobody, the goats are ear-tagged and registered to the council, meaning that Meakin and his colleagues are obliged to look after their welfare and sign off the vets＊ bills. (This year＊s ※goat budget§ is about ?2,000, or roughly ?1.50 per resident.) ※Some people believe that if you leave nature to itself, it will reach a natural balance,§ he says. ※Leaving nature to itself is why they ended up with 240 sick goats when we arrived. Every goat was riddled with worms, so it didn＊t matter how much they ate, the food would go straight through them. The mess they were making was dreadful, and they were always hungry.§ He attributes the overpopulation at the time to the council＊s reluctance to intervene for fear of further abuse (Joyce Salter blames the threats received by council members on animal rights activists from outside the area).It＊s at this point that we＊re joined by the current keeper of the goats, Jim Mackenzie (not his real name), Ray Werner having given up the role in 2009. He＊s just strained his back hefting bales, and he sits with his forearms on the table, suppressing his discomfort. Having received threats himself in the past, he insists I don＊t use his real name, but he＊s not unforthcoming. As well as his council duties, he＊s a gun dealer, and it＊s from him that Meakin bought his rifle. As we talk, it becomes clear that Mackenzie is in fact the marksman who carried out the 1997 cull, as well as most of the subsequent culling. ※I got rid of them,§ he says matter-of-factly. ※Four o＊clock in the morning, 10 o＊clock at night, in people＊s gardens, right down in the village.§ He favours a .243 Winchester with a silencer.※We＊ve got written approval from virtually every hotel and B&B in Lynton that we can go on to their property to shoot the goats,§ Meakin adds.Mackenzie admits that animals killed in the past were sent to the hunt kennels, but only to be burned; they are also sold for meat. ※It＊s a way to get some money back into the village,§ he says. ※People have got the notion I＊m making money out of it. I charge ?5 to dispose of a goat: shoot it, load it up, take it away, put it in Tony＊s garden, cover it up, contact Pierce＊s [the local ※collector of fallen stock§]. Oh, I＊m making a fortune.§※The fact is, human beings have affected the planet,§ Meakin says, ※and we need to try and make sure we maintain a reasonable balance. But who has the most rights, the goats or the residents? The goats don＊t pay rates.§Even those who object to the goats＊ incursions into the village accept that they contribute to the valley＊s tourist appeal; and there are few other animals that can keep the bracken and scrub under control (cattle and sheep tend to fall off the cliffs). As a site of special scientific interest, the Valley of Rocks is managed by  under a Higher Level Stewardship scheme, and the council receives an annual grant of just over ?10,000 towards its upkeep. Natural England＊s recommendation is that the herd be reduced to no more than 50 nannies, plus unweaned kids. Twice a year, a roundup is organised by Mackenzie, with the help of volunteers from the village and the local agricultural college, during which the goats are driven into a temporary enclosure, examined and treated by vets, and sick or injured animals put down. At the last roundup in April, all but 11 of the 64 goats removed were rehomed, the remainder being sent for slaughter, leaving about 70 in the valley, virtually all of them female.A couple of years ago, a programme was launched to give the nannies contraceptive jabs. But it＊s impossible to round up all the goats in such steep and perilous terrain, Mackenzie explains, and since then, no fewer than 80 kids have been born, an increase on previous years.I walk back to the Valley of Rocks along the coastal path. Joyce and Eric Salter still keep an eye on the goats, and their names are often among the commenters on Kirby＊s Facebook page, but the society is effectively defunct, and Joyce feels their efforts with Werner to preserve the old English goat were largely wasted. ※When we lived here before, I could go to the valley and sit there with the goats, and think: ＆I never want to move from here for the rest of my life.＊§ But she＊s no longer sure she and Eric will take up their plot in the cemetery.They drove through the valley yesterday to recce the goats＊ location, worried I＊d struggle to find them. ※There was a big herd under Castle Rock,§ she says, ※but there wasn＊t a single billy.§ I remember what Werner said about bad luck befalling the village if the herd were ever to go. South of Castle Rock, just as Joyce said, are eight nannies, bleating quietly to one another. Goats might be emblems of anarchy, but most of their lives are spent browsing and chewing the cud.Among the adults, partly hidden in the bracken, is a kid without an ear-tag. There are ways to recognise a billy, even in the absence of horns, and his existence is a reminder that, for all the efforts to control them, the goats of the Valley of Rocks remain essentially wild. I take a step closer and he vanishes into the bracken. William Atkins is the author of  (?9.99, Faber & Faber). His book about deserts, The Immeasurable World, is out next year.

"Passengers on cruise ships could be exposing themselves to dangerous levels of pollution, according to an investigation by Channel 4＊s Dispatches team that found some public areas on the ships＊ decks were more polluted than the world＊s worst-affected cities.The undercover investigation, which will be broadcast tonight at 8pm, focused on the levels of ※ultra-fine particles§ found in the air on and around cruise ships, from the fuel the ships＊ engines burn. These particles are so small 每 around a thousandth of the width of a human hair 每 that they can enter the bloodstream via the lungs.  More than 1.9 million people from the UK travel on a cruise each year and there is growing concern among the scientific community about the health risks. Dispatches used a P-Trak ultrafine particle counter to measure the ultra-fine particulates suspended in the air on board P&O Cruises＊ ship Oceana. The Oceana is more than 250 metres long, 15 storeys high and can carry more than 2,000 passengers.The device found 84,000 ultra-fine particulates per cubic centimetre on the deck downwind of, and directly next to, the Oceana＊s funnels. That＊s more than double the amount found at London＊s Piccadilly Circus, where the number of ultra-fine particulates per cubic centimetre was 38,400.Speaking to the Guardian, Dr Matthew Loxham, a specialist in air pollution at the University of Southampton, said these were the levels of pollution you would expect to find in cities such as Delhi or Shanghai. As for the health risks, there is, he says, cause for concern. ※From a scientific point of view, we know that pollution causes adverse health effects even in the short term,§ he said. ※On a ship deck, you＊re exposed to higher levels of pollution so you may get symptons such as runny nose, cough, dry eyes or a higher risk of asthma attacks. For those that are pre-disposed, there may be a higher risk of stroke or heart attack.§However he added that it is difficult to quantify the increase in risk for individual passengers. ※If you had a large enough number of people, you would be likely to see a quantifiable increase,§ he said. ※But it＊s difficult to say with individuals. Asthmatics, particularly, might find it harder to breath, need their medication more, or find the air triggers an asthma attack.§Large ships run on heavy fuel oil, which is legally permitted to contain 3.5% sulphur 每 that＊s 3,500 times what is permitted in road fuel. In EU ports and waters, ships are legally required to switch to a cleaner diesel, but even this, capped at 0.1% sulphur, is allowed to contain up to 100 times more sulphur than road fuel.Loxham said: ※If the cruise ships are complying with the law and there is still this level of pollutants, the question really is: are these laws fit for purpose?§As well as impacting on the health of passengers, crew and those who live beside docks, cruise ships are also having an impact on the global environment. John Maggs, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition, told Dispatches: ※Most large ships burn heavy fuel oil. It＊s a residual product from the refining industry, so after the refiners have produced the petrol and diesel we put in our cars, they＊re left with what is essentially a waste product. It＊s called residual fuel, or heavy fuel oil.§From an environmental point of view, it＊s bad because of the air pollution caused by the very high sulphur content. The shipping industry, however, has traditionally liked it because it＊s much cheaper than other fuels.§Also speaking to the Dispatch team, Daniel Rieger of the German environment association NABU (Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union) said: ※Ships cause not only greenhouse gas emissions, but also sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Per day one cruise ship emits as much particulate matter as a million cars. So 30 cruise ships pollute as much as all the cars in the United Kingdom.§Responding to the Dispatches team, P&O  said: ※Since 2005 we have reduced our fuel consumption by ＃ 28%, with the accompanying reduction in air emissions.§It added that the Oceana is to be fitted with exhaust gas cleaning systems, which are already ※installed on 60 ships across its brands＃ This action significantly improves the quality of air emissions＃ Soot and particulate matter reductions in excess of 80% have been achieved.§P&O also said that in 2014 it had reduced CO2 emissions by 20% and ※has renewed its goal to continue reducing the rate§.It said: ※The health, safety and welfare of guests and crew across all our ships is our absolute highest priority＃ We recognise that there is a public interest＃ related to particulate matter and related health issues§.

"here is a venerable tradition of literature about the lines humans have created in the British landscape. Alfred Watkins＊s , Francis Hitching＊s , Robert Macfarlane＊s  and a plethora of natural histories and hedgerow-seeking illuminations 每 recently John Wright＊s . All are fascinated with fragmentation and connection, and infused with the joys and conundrums we layer on our land with our human footfall. In , Hugh Warwick provides a good-humoured, even visionary, perspective on the fragile ecology of our hedges, roads, power lines and railways. Often opting for the hedgehog＊s-eye view (his first book, , declared his passion for this important indicator species), he reveals how the man-made lines in our landscape present a paradox. They were originally put there to fragment, assert ownership or to restrain livestock, yet over time their edges and intricacies have provided opportunities for adaptable wildlife to flourish. Walls sympathetic to wildlife can contribute to its recovery, sometimes ※very slowly, as lichens inch to the corners of the compass. Sometimes with the sneaky speed of a stoat on a mission.§While we have lost 98% of our wildflower meadows and 50% of our ancient woodland in the last 100 years, Warwick asks us to shift our sightline away from ugliness and ruination towards the potential of new habitats. ※Connection is what we need, and what nature needs if we are to tackle the global collapse of species,§ he argues.Wending his way along archeological lines such as the reaves 每 bronze age boundary walls 每 of Dartmoor, among hedges, ditches and dykes, Warwick considers how these man-made habitats came to be. In Woodwalton and Holme Fen in Cambridgeshire he sees a rejoining of wild with wild in the  project; between Peterborough and Huntingdon, where the destruction of rare and fragile wetlands was nearly complete, new lifeblood is returning. Little owls are attracting hordes of birdwatchers; right behind them hares frolic?among a?managed patchwork of newly scrutinised, rejuvenating land.Warwick presents the complexities of the task we have created for ourselves. Among the walls of North Ronaldsay, Orkney＊s most isolated island 每 where lichen was scraped from the rock to dye sheep＊s wool 每 black guillemots nest in the interstices of the stones and fulmars roost beside them. But although this architecture is a sanctuary, it can also be a death trap. Fulmars are gregarious and groups can become caught with no runway to take off, so they accumulate and perish.The author is at his lyrical best when discussing ※ancient paths and green lanes§: he sidles alongside highway historian  to describe ※the green lane effect§ of the warm, sheltered, microclimatic tunnels of Devon, where 2,000 species can be found within an 85-mile stretch. He focuses his inquisitive eye on beauty and complexity 每 roots like ※a wattle-wall ＃ like dancing figures writhing around one another§ 每 and praises the luxuriant foxgloves, their ※lewd openness and their promiscuous seduction of bumblebees§. Later he is seduced by the wobbly line of a badger track in deepest Dorset, ※a faint line in the grass which seemed to swallow me then spill me down as I slipped on unexpected slickness§. Sheltering from a rainstorm he shows us ※among twisted trees, hearts open to the world, knots rotted into perfect holes for wildlife to shelter§.None of our engineering escapes Warwick＊s ecological fossicking. Canals, for instance, not only made the world work more speedily for humans but were are also useful for invasive and recolonising organisms of all sorts. Railways, an even faster connection, were ※animated and deliberate earthquakes, destructive of all wise social habit, or possible natural beauty, carriages of damned souls on the ridges of their own graves＊, he writes, quoting John Ruskin. But the verges that are planted with hazel, and so noisy with the trains that predators are deterred, are dormouse heaven.Warwick is a generous companion and never a prickly know-it-all, even as he presents his manifesto for reconnection. ※Wherever we leave our lines we are creating change,§ he suggests. All such lines have the potential to help wildlife, he writes, but environmentalists need to sit at the same table as accountants, and all need to keep nature＊s wish-list in mind.

"umans now dominate the planet so heavily that we are pushing wild animals and plants into oblivion. Since 1970, the world＊s wildlife populations have halved, and it＊s not slowing down. In this new human age, the , we use more than half of the world＊s land for our food, cities, roads and mining; we use more than 40% of the planet＊s net primary productivity (that＊s everything produced by plants and animals); and we control three-quarters of all fresh water. We are the most numerous big animal on earth and the next in line are the animals we＊ve created through breeding to feed and serve us. Our planetary changes are on such a scale that one in five species is now threatened with extinction, roughly 1,000 times the natural rate.We are, biologists warn, entering the sixth mass extinction event in Earth＊s history. To put this into perspective, previous such events, including the one that killed off the dinosaurs, were the result of cataclysmic activities such as giant asteroid impacts or supervolcanic eruptions. This one is down to us.It is into this miserable melee of biodiversity loss and habitat destruction that biologist Chris Thomas enters, with his book, hopefully subtitled ※How nature is thriving in an age of extinction§. Decades of ecological research and travels in some of the most biologically interesting parts of the world, from Borneo to New Zealand (via Yorkshire), have revealed to him the scale of our impact on indigenous wildlife. But in the midst of this global extinction event, he was also discovering how our human changes were encouraging new life: immigrant species; newly emerging hybrids; and subspecies exhibiting freshly evolved adaptations. Such discoveries, which in many cases pertain to increased biodiversity under?our influence, have been either ignored or dismissed as valueless by his fellow environmentalists. This thoughtfully argued book, full of rich examples, is Thomas＊s attempt to ※throw off the shackles of a pessimism?laden, loss-only view of the world§ we are creating and to embrace our Anthropocene ecosystems.This is a book that invites us to take the long view of our current biodiversity crisis, looking from the billions-of-years perspective of ever-changing life on Earth and then forward another million or so. In many respects, Thomas argues, nature is coping surprisingly well in this human era 每 some two-thirds of animals are living in places where they wouldn＊t have survived 50 years ago. ※We should not ignore the gain side of the great biological equation of life,§ he urges.The number of species living in virtually every country or island has already increased because of us, and will continue to increase. This is because life evolves and adapts to changing environments, and we humans are excellent at?modifying our environments, from increasing herbivore numbers by hunting large animals and burning forests to clearing savannahs for swaths of artificially bred crops, to accidentally or deliberately introducing species isolated for millennia by geography and tectonics. And we have created a whole suite of novel landscapes, including roads and railways, bridges and jetties, canals and car parks, cities, parks and power stations. On top of this, we＊re responsible for a recent and rapid global warming, to a degree not seen for tens of thousands of years.These new habitats and warmer temperatures present opportunities for?a great many species, and Thomas describes remarkable success stories. ※On the whole, more species like it hot than cold,§ he writes, pointing out that British butterflies have ventured into northern climes as a result of warming and increased diversity there. The number of bird species moving uphill in Costa Rica＊s mountainous cloud forests has greatly exceeded the number that have died out. Birds and butterflies, of course, can alter their ranges more easily than many other animals and plants, and Thomas is careful to include caveats in this rosy picture.Introduced species are thriving and in many cases interbreeding to form new hybrid species that would never have existed had humans not brought them together. In Scotland, Japanese sika deer are breeding with native red deer, and immigrant rhododendrons are similarly cross-pollinating with their European cousins, helped by our national passion for gardening. ※More new plant species have come into hybrid existence in Britain in the last 300 years than are listed as having died out in the whole of Europe,§ Thomas writes. ※The current rate at which new species are forming on Earth is starting to look as though it is the highest ever.§Rather than celebrating this extraordinary emergence of novel ecosystems and speciation, though, conservationists are instead trying to rid ecosystems of non-natives and restore them to their ※pristine§ state, often by ※rewilding§. The problem with recreating the pristine is that it is?misplaced nostalgia 每 the natural world is a dynamic system, so choosing which past to return to is entirely subjective and fraught with difficulties.Past climates in Britain have been far warmer than now with a greater variety of native trees, Thomas notes, and there have also been times when our island was buried under ice. The vast majority of introduced species do no harm to natives and many benefit ecosystems, for example, by pollinating or providing food for others. ※Some might discount these new species as weeds and pests but that is a reflection of the human mind,§ he writes.Species that we think of as native and worthy of our protection, such as the common house sparrow, only appeared in these isles from the Asian Steppe relatively recently, and then only because we ※created somewhat Steppe-like conditions for them in the home counties§. Some 10,000 years ago there were no sparrows here at all; in Tudor times they were regarded as a pest. Now they are legally protected despite there being over 10 million in Britain.Thomas calls for a timely rethink of conservation practice. We should protect wildlife in places where it is feasible to do so 每 this may mean transporting some species to ecosystems where they did not previously occur 每 and help foster, manage and create novel ecosystems rich in diversity and resilient to our future changes. Instead of wasting our time battling rhododendrons and trying to return to an arbitrary version of the past, he argues, we should instead embrace the ※Anthropocene biological revolution§, which ※will almost certainly represent the sixth mass genesis of new biological diversity§.From the perspective of Earth-time, it makes a lot of sense. In the past 500 million years there have been five mass extinctions triggered by supervolcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts and other enormous planetary events that dramatically altered the climate. After each of these, the survivors regrouped, proliferated and evolved. The diversity of plants, animals, bacteria, fungi and other life on Earth is richer now than at any point in time. And so it will be in the future, Thomas argues. ※Come back in a million years and we might be looking at several million new species whose existence can be attributed to humans.§The problem with this argument is that none of us lives on a millions-of-years timeframe; indeed most struggle to imagine a decade or two hence. We are the lucky beneficiaries of an explosion of life that followed the last mass extinction event, which killed 75% of species on Earth, but presumably that＊s cold comfort for the dinosaurs. This time it is humans who dominate the planet, and we are causing an extinction event that threatens not just the species we like, but those we depend on. While?this engaging, provocative and important book paints a refreshingly optimistic picture of life on Earth, the future for humanity is not so certain.

"The federal government is allowing the huge spike in land clearing in Queensland to destroy threatened ecological communities, the habitat of threatened species and increase pollution on the  by failing to enforce environmental law, according to analysis by WWF.Following the . analysis found almost 10,000 properties have either cleared at least one hectare of land since 2013, or have notified the state government that they plan to. Combined, that will result in almost 1m hectares of land being cleared.Although the clearing may be allowable under permissive state laws, much of it could require approval under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity  (EPBC) act.The minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg,  if the clearing activities ※have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance under federal environment law,§ then they required approval under the EPBC.And last week, Frydenberg  the Turnbull government had powers to enforce those laws and would continue to do so.Among the almost 10,000 properties that have either cleared more than 1ha of land, or plan to, WWF found 86% of them (7,919) are clearing an endangered ecosystem, the habitat of an endangered animal, or that it would occur inside a catchment for a river that flows into the Great Barrier Reef 每 all factors that appeared to meet the criteria for referral under the EPBC.But according to the government , only five of those almost 8,000 properties have referred clearing for approval under the EPBC, and just one had been forced to gain approval through it. That leaves 99.92% of properties that appear to be undertaking clearing that needs federal approval, going ahead without approval.Among that clearing, a full 9% of  is thought to live in has either been cleared or has been earmarked for clearing.And besides directly affecting endangered ecosystems and species, when the clearing occurs in Great Barrier Reef catchments, it increases sediment flow, damaging the coral.The , which noted Australia＊s failure to regulate clearing, and found Australia＊s water quality targets would not be reached without further action.Martin Taylor, protected areas and conservation science manager at WWF, said he sent the analysis to Frydenberg＊s office in May but has not heard back.※State laws should prevent this but the last line of defence is the commonwealth,§ Taylor said. ※If the federal government isn＊t enforcing their laws, which appears to be the case at the moment, then there is no last line of defence.§WWF＊s analysis found that the non-referred land earmarked for clearing was dominated by a small number of properties 每 just 112 or 1.2% of applications 每 that proposed to clear more than 1,000ha of land each.More than half of the non-referred property that appeared to require approval under the EPBC fell in Great Barrier Reef catchments.Both Frydenberg and the department of environment and energy were approached for comment.A spokesperson for the department said the minister had passed the information from WWF to the relevant areas in the department but that they do not ※release information in relation to specific compliance matters§.The spokesperson said: ※The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 protects matters of national environmental significance. Actions that have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance must be approved before they commence.§"																																																			
"The  phenomenon has broken publishing and cinema box-office records and spawned a series of lucrative theme parks. But wildlife experts are sounding the alarm over a sad downside to JK Rowling＊s tales of the troubled young wizard. The illegal trade in owls has jumped in the far east over the past decade and researchers fear it could endanger the survival of these distinctive predators in Asia.Conservationists say the snowy owl Hedwig 每 who remains the young wizard＊s loyal companion for most of the  series 每 is fuelling global demand for wild-caught birds for use as pets. In 2001, the year in which the first film was released, only a few hundred were sold at Indonesia＊s many bird markets. By 2016, the figure had soared to more than 13,000, according to researchers Vincent Nijman and Anna Nekaris of Oxford Brookes University in a paper in . At around $10 to $30, the price tag is affordable to most middle-class families.The issue is of critical concern because the owls being offered for sale are nearly all taken from the wild. ※The overall popularity of owls as pets in  has risen to such an extent that it may imperil the conservation of some of the less abundant species,§ Nijman and Nekaris say.As a result, they urge that owls should be added to Indonesia＊s list of protected bird species, pointing out that owls may look cute on display in the market but generally die quickly after being removed from the wild.Indonesia is not alone. Several other countries have in the past noted increases in sales of owls, which they have also blamed on the popularity of Harry Potter books and films.The Indian MP Jairam Ramesh has blamed fans of the boy wizard for their role in the dwindling of numbers of wild owls in the country. ※Following Harry Potter, there seems to be a strange fascination even among the urban middle classes for presenting their children with owls,§ he noted.However, conservationists also point out that owls are sometimes sacrificed in  for their supposed medicinal properties.A study by the conservationists Serene Chng and James Eaton found widespread illegal trade in many birds 每 including owls 每 at Chatuchak weekend market in Bangkok, .※We recorded 17 individuals of three species, all of which are native to and protected in Thailand, indicating that the animals were being illegally traded,§ Chng and Eaton state. ※Most appeared to be in poor condition ... with some being on the verge of unconsciousness, suggesting a high level of mortality.§ Again the authors linked the high demand for owls to the popularity of the Potter books.The link between the books and the increase in the number of owls being sold cannot be proved. The circumstantial evidence is strong, nevertheless. Owls were once called  in Malay but are now known as , or Harry Potter birds.※In the 1990s and 2000s 每 when I lived in Indonesia 每 I visited the markets frequently and very few had any owls for sale. Some larger markets in Jakarta occasionally had one or two but only infrequently,§ Nijman told the . ※But that has changed. I visited Jatinegara market in Jakarta last week and within 30 minutes I had recorded 108 scops owls and 27 barn owls. A total of 13 vendors were offering owls.§In addition, many owls sold in south Asia today are named after Harry Potter characters, including Hedwig. ※Two weeks ago I was in a exotic pet cafe in Bangkok and they had two owls, called Hedwig and Harry, and visitors could pet them and have their photo taken with them, dressed up as Harry or Hermione,§ added Nijman.For her part, Rowling has condemned the keeping of owls as pets. Shortly after the release of the first Harry Potter film in the UK 每 where the trade is more tightly controlled 每 bird sanctuaries reported a rise in numbers of abandoned pet owls. This prompted the author to speak out.※If anybody has been influenced by my books to think an owl would be happiest shut in a small cage and kept in a house, I would like to take this opportunity to say as forcefully as I can, ＆you are wrong＊,§ she said. ※The owls in Harry Potter books were never intended to portray the true behaviour or preferences of real owls.§Nijman agrees with her: ※Owls don＊t make good pets. Actually, most wild animals don＊t make good pets. That＊s why people spent thousands of years domesticating the few species that are now domesticated.§"																																																			
"n 1996, William Robichaud spent  before she died. Robichaud studied Martha 每 a beautiful, enigmatic, shy saola 每 with a scientist＊s eye but also fell under the gracile animal＊s spell as she ate out of his hand and allowed herself to be stroked. Captured by local hunters, Martha spent those final days in a Laotian village, doted on by Robichaud.Since losing Martha, Robichaud has become the coordinator of the  (SWG) at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). He has dedicated his life to saving this critically endangered species 每 and believes the best chance to achieve that now is through a captive breeding programme. ※We need to act while there is still time,§ he said adding that ※seldom, if ever§ are captive breeding programs begun too soon for . ※More likely, too late.§We just found the saola 每 and now we＊re . Hardly a household name, the saola was one of the most astounding biological discoveries of the 20th Century. In 1992, a group of scientists met a local hunter in  who gave them a skull of something no biologist had ever seen before. The animal 每 the saola or  每 was a large-bodied terrestrial mammal (80-100kg) that somehow eluded science, though not local people, well into the information age. Scientists compared it＊s remarkable discovery to that of the okapi, described 91 years prior.The saola was so distinct 每 two backwards-curving horns, unmistakable white face markings, an ungulate that looked more like those in Africa than Asia 每 that it was given its own genus. Scholars long debated whether it was in the antelope family or the bovine 每 genetic evidence shows it＊s a primitive bovine, despite physically resembling an antelope. But it＊s been coined the ＆Asian unicorn＊ due to its rarity and elusiveness 每 its almost magical quality for those privileged enough to encounter it. Four years after the skull came to light, Martha was caught in  and brought into a local village 每 the first time scientists like Robicahud saw a living animal. But it wasn＊t until 1998 that researchers were able to get a photo of the saola in the wild by using remote camera traps. And then again in 1999. Fifteen years passed before researchers got the most recent one on camera in 2013. The animal is only found in the Annamite mountains, a biological hotspot that spans Vietnam, Laos and a sliver of  (though saolas have never been found in the latter). The forest is also home to Indochinese tigers, Asian elephants, gaurs, douc langur monkey, white-cheeked gibbons 每 and many other recently discovered species: the Annamite striped rabbit (found in 1996) the large-antlered muntjac (1994) , and the kha-nyou or Laotian rock rat (2005), a large rodent that＊s believed to be a living fossil, its closest relative having gone extinct 11 million years ago. No one really knows how many saola are left 每 the IUCN says ※undoubtedly less than 750, and likely much less,§ but Robichaud says may be fewer than 100 每 and the species is safe nowhere. It＊s being decimated by poaching snares left out to catch other species. Ranger patrols have removed 150,000 snares from five saola sites in Laos and Vietnam, but it＊s still not enough. ※There is no site in the saola＊s range where we believe the species is yet safe from poaching,§ RobichaudGiven conservationists can＊t guarantee the soala＊s survival in the wild 每 especially in the midst of an almost total obliteration of animals in southeast Asian forests for the wildlife trade 每 the next step is captive breeding. Captive breeding saolas is still a bold proposition, however, given how rarely the species has been seen since its discovery. No biologist has seen a living saola in the wild 每 ever. And locals encounter them only very rarely. But conservationists have little choice but to be optimistic that they will not only be able to catch a pair of saolas, but that they will be able to keep them alive: a conservation centre for soalas is being built in Vietnam＊s Bach Ma national park and will be completed later this year or early next. The saola team believes they have a good idea of where they can find them. They will depend on local knowledge, both for finding and catching the ＆unicorns＊. Information on the exact location is being kept confidential, however, out of fear of poachers.Robert Timmins, biologist and a member of the SWG, said the captive breeding would do the exact ※opposite of what happened in the past§. The programme would depend on advice from the best experts worldwide 每 including those from the zoo community. They would have a facility built specially to the purpose, hire professional staff and work with local governments. All this opposed to a saola in a pen in a village. ※This is not to say the effort will be without risk,§ Robichaud said. ※But non-action now poses a greater risk to the survival of saola.§ But before the team heads out to round up saolas, they plan to test their methods on another species: the giant or large-antlered muntjac. Although quite different mammals 每 muntjacs are small, Asiatic deer 每 the large-antlered muntjac and saola＊s stories are similar in some important ways. The large-antlered muntjac was also only discovered very recently (two years before the saola) and it is also threatened by overhunting and snaring. Although also critically endangered, the giant muntjac is more common than the saola. According to Robichaud, this makes it a good subject for testing the team＊s methods for catching and transferring a large mammal safely to the breeding centre 每 and keeping it alive. Of course, captive breeding giant muntjacs could ensure their survival too. At the same time Robichaud and other conservationists plan to redouble efforts to rid saola areas of snares and learn more about this real-life unicorn. But in an age of , insurance populations are becoming more vital than ever if we are to maintain some of the wonderful animals we share this planet with. ※[Captive breeding] is the last hope and should have been done 10 years or more ago,§ Timmins said. ※But more easily said than done.§ Martha died 21 years ago with Robichaud by her side; it was only after she succumbed that conservationists realised she was pregnant. Now, conservationists hope they can recreate her story, but with a happier ending."																																																			
"he US government＊s withdrawal from dealing with, or even acknowledging, climate change may have provoked widespread opprobrium, but for Alaskan communities at risk of toppling into the sea, the risks are rather more personal.The Trump administration has moved to dismantle climate adaptation programs including the , an Anchorage-based agency that is crafting a plan to safeguard or relocate dozens of towns at risk from rising sea levels, storms and the winnowing away of sea ice.Federal assistance for these towns has been ponderous but could now grind to a halt, with even those working on the issue seemingly targeted by the administration. In July, Joel Clement, an interior department official who worked with Alaskan communities on climate adaptation,  to a completely unrelated position because of the administration＊s ideological hostility to the issue.※We were getting down to the brass tacks of relocation [of towns at risk] and now work has just stopped,§ Clement told the Guardian. He has lodged an official complaint over his reassignment.※Without federal coordination from Washington DC, there isn＊t much hope. This will take millions of dollars and will take years, and these people don＊t have years. I think it＊s clear I was moved because of my climate work. It feels like a complete abdication of responsibility on climate change.§ to the Army Corps of Engineers, 31 Alaskan communities face ※imminent§ existential threats from coastline erosion, flooding and other consequences of temperatures that are rising twice as quickly in the state as the global average. A handful 每 Kivalina, Newtok, Shishmaref and Shaktoolik 每 are considered in particularly perilous positions and will need to be moved.※It was clear from the start of the Trump administration that there was no interest in helping Alaskan communities, particularly coastal communities, adapt to climate change,§ said Victoria Hermann, president of the . ※There＊s now no liaison from Washington on the issue. The biggest loss has been momentum. It feels like the Obama administration was kickstarting something useful but now it has dropped dead.§Shishmaref, like Shaktoolik and Kivalina, is a town with several hundred inhabitants located on a barrier island.  to relocate to the mainland but, in common with other Alaskan towns, there is no clear source of funding to do this. Meanwhile, Newtok, which sits on the banks of a river and is losing about 70ft of land a year to erosion,  for disaster funding to relocate.The coastal communities are threatened by a confluence of conditions that are making life difficult even for the flinty residents, who are used to dealing with an inhospitable, remote environment.As the coastal buffer of sea ice retreats, towns are more vulnerable to storms and coastline erosion. Many key structures are built on permafrost, which is also melting, causing the buildings to subside or even crumple completely. And a succession of mild years 每 2016 was  than the long-term average 每 is disrupting the patterns of wildlife in an environment where people rely upon the animals they catch for sustenance.※People are coping with the loss of their history, places where they could reliably hunt and gather food, their burial sites,§ said Mike Brubaker, of the  Native Tribal Health Consortium. ※It causes a lot of distress. Before you see the physical impacts of climate change, you see the mental impacts.§The , which Brubaker is involved with, has documented a number of recent unusual events linked to climate change, including the sighting of baby squid far outside their normal range by a group of Alaskan school children, altered salmon migration patterns and a lake near the peninsula town of Port Heiden that is on the brink of overflowing due to erosion.These environmental shifts are placing strain on the viability of several towns that have found both the state and federal government unwilling to fully commit to the cost of moving them 每 in Shishmaref＊s case, it will take $180m to relocate a town of 600 people to safer ground. The Denali Commission is working on a strategy to save the towns once disaster finally hits and has already helped fund upgrades to vulnerable infrastructure. But the agency has been earmarked by the White House for elimination, which would further complicate communities＊ years-long quest for relocation.※We have communities here at threat and my peers in DC know this and are asking how they can help,§ said Joel Neimeyer, federal co-chair of the commission, who said work would continue at the agency until Congress decided on its future. ※At the moment there isn＊t a mechanism to fund an entire village location. It＊s done in dribs and drabs. We don＊t know yet if Congress wants to fund a village relocation.※This is about how to put a blueprint in place to fund [re]location when disaster hits. If Hurricane Katrina was going to hit you and you had a year to prepare, could you come up with a plan that would shorten the pain and suffering? I believe the answer is yes.§Port Heiden has already gone through the process of relocation, moving to higher ground to escape a rapidly eroding shoreline. The last resident of the ※old§ Port Heiden moved away a decade ago and now all but four of the original structures have washed away.The threat hasn＊t completely passed, however. The fuel tankers that supply the town have to sidle alongside a ragged coastline 每 it＊s no longer a port 每 and use long pipes to dispense their cargo. Further erosion could make this impossible. Port Heiden＊s school is also in a vulnerable spot and may have to be relocated.※I thought at one time it wouldn＊t be a problem for us, but we are real flat,§ said Scott Anderson, a former commercial fisherman who moved to Port Heiden in 1994. ※The change has been rapid. It＊s a lot wetter. The caribou have gone away. There used to be a dog and sled team but you don＊t see that anymore because it＊s rare to have a winter where everything freezes up.※I imagine these things go in cycles but it concerns the locals. People in Port Heiden definitely think climate change is a real and serious threat.§"																																																			
"magine, if you will, a government board to  without any artists on it, or an  without any medical researchers.Or perhaps even, imagine a government authority set up to provide expertise on climate policy without any actual climate scientists.Well you don＊t have to imagine that last one, because that＊s what we now have 每 the government＊s Climate Change Authority is now  climate scientist. Prof David Karoly, of the University of Melbourne, has just finished his term on the authority＊s board 每 the only member to stick it out for the full five years. Karoly says without someone to replace him, the authority will struggle to fulfil its legal mandate. He told me:I asked the Department of the Environment and Energy if there were any plans to replace Karoly with another climate scientist. The department said:So in other words, it won＊t replace Karoly and will instead just rely on the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, to act as a go-between, which of course is much more efficient and logical than actually having a climate scientist right there in the room. That would be silly, right?Remembering too that the CCA has always had the serving chief scientist on its board so, by this logic, Karoly was always a spare part. In reality, the makeup and character of the CCA was fundamentally altered after Malcolm Turnbull made changes to the board in 2015.So why did Karoly decide to stick it out this long, when colleagues including ,  were throwing in the towel out of frustration that the government was listening to rightwing anti-science advocates instead of actual expertise? Says Karoly:Karoly＊s account of a shift in the authority under the Turnbull government matches that of  that ※the whole character of the authority changed§.In its earlier years, the CCA had been forthright in its advice to the government. Simply put, the authority＊s detailed reports showed targets to cut emissions were well short of what was needed if Australia wanted to mount any sort of claim to be doing its fair share globally. Under the former Liberal leader Tony Abbott, the government vowed to axe the authority entirely 每 but couldn＊t get enough support in parliament. So instead, if you believe its former insiders, the authority was carefully manipulated and undermined.As Hamilton put it, the CCA became ※dominated by people who want action, but not too much action§."																																																			
"Human-caused climate change dramatically increased the likelihood of the extreme heatwave that saw deadly forest fires blazing in Portugal and Spain, new research has shown.Much of western  sweltered earlier in June, and the severe heat in England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland was also made significantly more likely by global warming. Such temperatures will become the norm by 2050, the scientists warned, unless action is taken to rapidly cut carbon emissions.Scientists combined temperature records and the latest observations with a series of sophisticated computer models to calculate how much the global rise in greenhouse gases has raised the odds of the soaring temperatures.They found the heatwave that struck Portugal and Spain was 10 times more likely to have occurred due to global warming.

" will cause ice-free areas on Antarctica to increase by up to a quarter by 2100, threatening the diversity of the unique terrestrial plant and animal life that exists there, according to projections from the first study examining the question in detail.If emissions of greenhouse gasses are not reduced, projected warming and changes in snowfall will cause ice-free areas 每 which currently make up about 1% of  and are home to all of the continent＊s terrestrial plants and animals 每 to increase by as much as 17,000 square kilometres.Since many of the ice-free areas on Antarctica are isolated from one another, they have acted like islands in the ocean, with the life existing in each one forming distinct groups. As those areas expand in the future, they will become closer to one another, with many coalescing, allowing the distinct groups to mix and potentially homogenise.By 2100, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the expansion of ice-free patches will lead to their overall number decreasing from more than 5,500 to fewer than 3,000, according to the work by Jasmine Lee from the Australian Antarctic Division and colleagues .If emissions begin to reduce from 2040, the expansion of the patches will be limited and as many as 4,000 distinct patches could remain.About 85% of the new ice-free areas will emerge in the Antarctic peninsula, which extends out into the Southern Ocean towards Chile. The Antarctic peninsula has experienced the most rapid warming in the southern hemisphere already and is predicted to see five metres of ice melt by 2100.As a result, the Antarctic peninsula will emerge as the region of Antarctica with the most ice-free area, overtaking the Transantarctic Mountains.The researchers found the South Orkney Islands were likely to become completely ice-free by 2100 if global temperatures exceeded 2C of warming, leading to what the researchers described as ※a complete transformation of the physical environment§ there.Some further expansion of ice-free areas was projected to occur on the opposite side of Antarctica from the peninsula, in East Antarctica.As the ice-free areas expand, the researchers said several threats were likely to be realised, with winners and losers emerging.Some native species were likely to expand their available habitat, accessing new resources and thriving. But those changes could have destabilising effects on the ecosystems there, enabling the spread of invasive species, which were already posing a substantial threat to native species.※While this might provide new areas for native species to colonise, it could also result in the spread of invasive species and, in the long term, the extinction of less competitive native species,§ said Aleks Terauds from the Australian Antarctic Division, a co-author on the paper.In May,  native plant life on Antarctica had already responded dramatically to temperature increases, growing at a rate four or five times faster than in the 1950s."																																																			
"lugs are much maligned. Having the temerity to wear their slime on the outside of their bodies, they are about as far removed from our notion of cute and cuddly as is possible without being tapeworms. But they are misunderstood and persecuted beyond necessity 每 with ecological knock-on effects for the slow-worms, thrushes, hedgehogs, badgers and other animals further up the food chain. True, some slugs will eat your plants, but naturalist Chris Packham recently made a : with that in mind, here are five reasons to admire slugs: Most slugs are scavengers, but that can be handy. They eat that catch-all substrate, ※decaying organic matter§, which includes dead and rotting plants; leaf litter; fungoid wood; fallen fruit; animal droppings; carrion; deliquescent toadstools; and mouldering compost. If they sometimes nibble idly at a leaf, it is probably because the leaf is already damaged or diseased. The great grey slug, , is a voracious predator, eating snails (actually the main culprits in the veg patch), worms, maggots and other insect larvae. They are not above cannibalism, which can make it awkward if slugs are kept together as pets. Slug sex is a marvel to behold. Two hermaphrodite slugs meet on a tree branch and secrete a thick rope of extra-viscous slime, down which they gyrate like pole-dancers. Each inflates a huge, pale, flower-shaped penis, which they entwine together, and each slug fertilises the other. All this while dangling in mid-air. Although lacking the protection of a snail shell, slugs make up for any supposed disadvantage by being able to insinuate their smooth, flexible and lubricated bodies down into the tiniest crevices. This makes them truly subterranean creatures, and they can easily push down a?metre into the soil. Slugs make  to inspire children with the wonder of the natural world. Close up, admire the telescopic eye and feeler stalks on?the head; peer into the large breathing hole, or  down the right side of the body (like snails, slugs are not bilaterally symetrical); and admire the rhythmic muscular ripples on its belly as a large, moist slug glides smoothly and effortlessly up a?sheet of glass."																																																			
"In February, Pavel Fomenko was told that the body of a young female tiger had been discovered underneath a car parked outside the town of Luchegorsk, in eastern Russia. Fomenko 每 head of rare species conservation for WWF  每 took the corpse for examination where he uncovered the grim details of the animal＊s death.The Amur tiger, which is also known as the Siberian tiger, had been caught in a trap and had chewed off a paw to free itself. It was left crippled, unable to hunt, and died of starvation while seeking shelter under the car. ※Hearing about this sort of thing is always painful,§ said Fomenko. ※This was a beautiful tigress.§ It is harrowing scenes such as these that conservation groups are hoping will become increasingly rare in the years to come. Later this week, WWF will launch an appeal that aims not just to halt the decline in tiger numbers but to boost them to new levels. The goal is to increase the world＊s tiger population in the wild to more than 6,000 by 2022, the next Chinese year of the tiger. In this way, it should be possible to achieve global security for this poster boy and girl of the conservation movement.The death of the tigress found under the car is tempered by the knowledge that the Amur is part of a global wild tiger population that has started to rise, albeit marginally, after decades of decline. The world lost 97% of its tiger population in a little over a century, but last year, WWF reported that global numbers in the wild had risen from 3,200 in 2010 to about 3,900 in 2016, thanks to the introduction of anti-poaching patrols, habitat protection and other measures.※The increase in tiger numbers is encouraging but the species＊ future in its natural environment still hangs in the balance and numbers remain perilously low,§ said Rebecca May, WWF＊s tiger specialist. ※There now needs to be an enormous push forward to build on this progress. We need commitment and urgent action from all governments of ＆tiger-range＊ countries [where tigers still roam free], as well as the passion and unwavering support of the public.§To fund the campaign, WWF will launch an appeal this week for the public to become ※tiger protectors§ by donating ?5 a month to its programme. Some of this money will be used to expand reserves in the wild where tigers can mix and breed in greater numbers, reversing a trend that has seen the tiger＊s range in Asia shrink by nearly 95% over the past 150 years.This attrition of habitat has continued unabated into recent times. Between 2006 and 2014, the tiger＊s already dwindling range shrank a further 40%. By contrast, human populations have soared in tiger-range countries 每 which include India, Russia, Nepal and nine other Asian nations that now have a human population of 3.2 billion, double the number in 1977.In addition, poaching, habitat destruction and climate change still pose major threats to the species, problems that are all illustrated by the battle to save the Amur tiger. In 2010, it was estimated that more than 70% of Amur deaths were caused by humans, most of them poachers who use roads built deep into forests by the logging industry to find the tigers.The Russian government has recently introduced a package of measures aimed at boosting Amur numbers, including restricting logging in tiger habitat areas and increased penalties for poaching and the possession of tiger parts, which are sold to countries in the Far East where they are considered to have medicinal properties.As head of conservation, Fomenko has been trying to implement these measures, work that sometimes requires spending a month or more in the wild tracking and protecting tigers 每 including fights with poachers 每 and investigating sites where poaching and suspicious tiger deaths have occurred. ※There＊s the risk of getting lost, the risk of getting frostbitten, the risk of encountering a predator. There is a high chance of meeting death,§ he said.The fortunes of the Amur tiger have been more encouraging than most. Its population had dropped to only 20 to 30 animals in the 1930s and the species was on the brink of extinction. Today, there may be more than 500 Amurs in the wilds of Siberia thanks to the work of conservationists such as Fomenko, backed by governments that value good conservation.It remains to be seen if this reversal can be maintained, although Fomenko is under no illusions about the value of such work: ※Tigers are powerful, they are beautiful, they are perfect 每 and they can co-exist with humans.§"																																																			
"Current and former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees have described how work on climate change is grinding to a halt at the agency, with programs being scrapped and fears that staff may be reassigned away from climate-related tasks.The Trump administration is tearing up key planks of Barack Obama＊s emissions-lowering agenda, with the president  the US from the Paris climate agreement last week and tasking the EPA with rewriting the clean power plan, which aims to curb greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants.Climate work at the EPA is being systematically targeted for elimination, according to Alyssa Hall, who was the climate change adaption coordinator for EPA＊s region one, which encompasses New England, until last month.※I felt like we were being attacked on a daily basis from headquarters. A lot of my projects were being cancelled or postponed indefinitely, so I was left with nothing to do,§ Hall told the Guardian.Hall worked on integrating climate change considerations into the EPA＊s programs, better preparing the agency for a world with higher temperatures, rising seas and more intense storms. But the change in direction under the incoming  was like ※whiplash§, she said, with staff afraid of even using the term ※climate change§ in emails.※If it was a project associated with climate change, people at headquarters would pick up the phone rather than email,§ she said. ※Staff were paranoid that their programs were going to get cut if they mentioned climate change. One day it was fine and then it was like you were being slapped in the face every day.§Hall, who now works in the private sector, said that ※everyone knows§ at the agency that climate change staff will be sent to other areas. The EPA has  moving climate adaption employees to new roles, although an agency spokesman said he would not comment on rumors of reassignments. The climate change division and the climate protection partnership division  within the EPA＊s office of air and radiation.Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, has launched what he calls a ※§ strategy at the agency where focus shifts from climate change to basic functions such as cleaning up toxic sites and addressing air and water pollution.Pruitt was a key proponent of abandoning the Paris deal and spoke after Trump＊s confirmed the US＊s exit at the White House last week to praise the president for his ※unflinching commitment to put America first§.Pruitt later toured various TV interviews on Sunday to defend leaving the voluntary accord to lower emissions, a move that has been widely criticized by businesses such as Facebook and Goldman Sachs and environmentalists but praised by leading Republicans.※This is not a message to anyone in the world that America should be apologetic of its CO2 position,§ Pruitt . ※We＊re actually making tremendous advances. We＊re just not going to agree to frameworks and agreements that put us at an economic disadvantage and hurt citizens across this country.§Pruitt repeatedly refused to say whether Trump 每 who has expressed climate scepticism  每 accepted the mainstream science of climate change. The EPA administrator has  that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of warming temperatures, a stance contrary to established scientific evidence and, until a recent  of content took down the page, the EPA＊s own website.An EPA air quality scientist, who did not want to be named, said the leadership of the agency ※seems to have disdain for our work§ and claimed that climate change tasks were being wound down.※All action at the agency on climate has effectively stopped; the only thing that hasn＊t is the collection of emissions data,§ the scientist told the Guardian. ※Climate work has been de-emphasized and halted. There was a climate conference in Atlanta last month and EPA employees were told not to go, so even simple interactions are coming to an end.§The scientist said many of his colleagues ※no longer respect our administrator§.※He＊s made public statements that are counterfactual; he doesn＊t seem to understand basic science,§ the scientist said. ※There are no lines of authority any more. Pruitt makes statements in public, but I don＊t take my orders through the media.※There＊s a sizeable group at the EPA worried about out jobs an the ability of the agency to perform its core role. I don＊t think the administration is serious about protecting human health, but I am, and I＊m going to keep at it.§The administration＊s  calls for the EPA＊s funding to be cut by a third, eliminating dozens of programs such as climate change, anti-pollution efforts at the Great Lakes and Gulf of Mexico and severely paring back money going to toxic cleanups, known as Superfund sites.Some former EPA employees have expressed concern that the agency＊s basic civil and criminal enforcement actions would be undone by a budget that axes money used to help bring cases against errant polluters.Cynthia Giles, who was an EPA assistant administrator for the office of enforcement in the Obama administration, said the the budget would prevent major EPA cases such as the successful pursuit of BP over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill and Volkswagen over the emissions cheating scandal.※To bring cases you need money for monitoring equipment, engineering issues, management of millions of documents 每 all that would be zeroed out in this budget,§ Giles told the Guardian.※Enforcement is focused on the biggest threats to public health, cases the states can＊t and won＊t do. The message this budget sends is that enforcement laws aren＊t a priority for this administration, which is very concerning.§The EPA＊s 2018 budget is very unlikely to exactly mirror the Trump administration＊s request, however, with Congress set to craft its own version this year."																																																			
"Call it Noah＊s Ark on lorries. Dozens of trucks rolled over the Zimbabwe savanna carrying elephants, giraffe, African buffalo, zebras, and numerous other large iconic mammals. Driving more than 600km of dusty roadway, the trucks will deliver their wild loads to a new home: Zinave national park in . The animals are a donation from Mozambique＊s Sango Wildlife Conservancy 每 a gift that the owner, Wilfried Pabst, says would not be possible without funds from controversial trophy hunting.※In remote places and countries with a weak tourism industry and a high unemployment rate, it is very difficult 每 or almost impossible 每 to run a conservancy like Sango without income from sustainable utilisation,§ Pabst said. ※Sustainable utilisation§ means the use of wildlife for hunting or trophy hunting. Pabst, who purchased Sango in 1993 and opened its doors 10 years later, says that trophy hunting provides approximately 60% of the revenue required to keep Sango running every year. Another 30% comes out of the German businessman＊s own pockets.While Sango does welcome non-hunting tourists, Pabst says it is not possible to attract enough in this remote area to equal the revenue made by trophy hunters willing to travel to pay tens of thousands of dollars to shoot iconic megafauna, includingNile crocodiles, elephants and lions. Over the next six years, Pabst will donate 6,000 large mammals from Sango to Zinave as part of the Peace Park Foundation＊s  to rewild a vast tract of land in the Great Limpopo Transfrontier conservation area (TFCA).Mozambique＊s 15-year-long civil war left its once world-renowned parks almost empty of any animal large enough to shoot and eat, but numerous efforts today are working to bring back animals to Mozambique, often transporting them from either neighboring South Africa or .But, Masha Kalinina, a trade policy specialist with the Humane Society International, said the plan to transport thousands of animals across Zimbabwe to Mozambique was ※misguided§ and ※potentially deadly§ for individual animals. Indeed, such transports are not without risk: an elephant died last year en route to Zinave from South .※Mozambique continues to have one of the highest rates of poaching in southern Africa,§ she said. Mozambique  to poachers in five years. ※Now both South Africa and Zimbabwe are transporting their own animals to this park just so that they may die at the hands of either trophy hunters or poachers. Is that what we are calling conservation?§ Kalinina asked. Still, there is little chance of rewilding Zinave without bringing animals overland. A similar transportation project was done for Mozambique＊s Gorongosa national park 每 though nowhere near this scale 每 and it succeeded in bringing new species that had been lost during the war. While poaching is particularly high in parts of Mozambique, it is also a pressing concern in Zimbabwe and most other countries 每 few African mammals live beyond the cloud of the global poaching crisis.Pabst say he is not making any revenue from the donation of 6,000 mammals but views it as a part of Sango＊s commitment to wildlife conservation in Africa. The funding for transporting the animals, which includes a small army of veterinarians, rangers, ecologist, truck drivers and helicopter pilots, is coming from the Peace Park Foundation. Sango is at the center of Zimbabwe＊s Sav谷 Valley conservancy, in remote eastern Zimbabwe. A few decades ago, Sav谷 Valley 每 nearly the size of Cornwall 每 was overrun by cattle. Now, it is bustling with herds of iconic African species, including 160 rhinos that require constant guarding against poachers. Pabst＊s Sango covers about 17% of Sav谷 Valley and is run under what＊s known as a bilateral investment promotion and protection agreements (BIPPA), which allows Pabst to manage the conservancy privately via permission from the Zimbabwe government, including setting quotas for trophy hunters. Kalinina contends that Sav谷 Valley Conservancy is ※nothing more than a profit-driven wildlife ranch stocked with wild animals.§ She says they are not doing this for conservation but ※to sell animals to globetrotting trophy hunters.§Trophy hunting has been controversial for decades, but the issue took on a new global awareness last year after the  in Zimbabwe went viral. Despite the fact that around 600 lions are killed yearly in Africa by trophy hunters, something about this particular story 每 and this lion 每 captured the public＊s attention. Kalinina said despite the attempt by hunting groups to ※greenwash§ it, trophy hunting is ※unethical, cruel, a threat to non-consumptive tourism like wildlife watching, offers no long-term conservation benefits, and provides minimal economic and employment value§.For his part, Pabst insists that Sango couldn＊t survive without trophy hunting. He said if trophy hunting were suddenly outlawed in Zimbabwe 每 as some organisations may wish 每 his operation ※would run out of money within months and most of the 200,000 animals will be poached probably within one year§.While trophy hunters, by definition, shoot to bring a ※trophy§ home, the meat of the animal killed is often eaten as well. In Africa, the meat is usually shared with local communities. Although there are some animals you typically don＊t eat: lions, leopards and rhino. Elephants are only eaten in some places. The only two large animals that are not hunted in Sango are African wild dogs and rhinos, because these endangered species are protected in the country.※We exclude additional species from hunting as the situation dictates,§ Pabst added.Sango keeps a close track of its animals. Depending on the species, Sango allows hunting of approximately between 0.2-1% of an animal＊s total population annually.※Sustainable [hunting] means that the off take will neither hinder the growth, nor allow any given species to fall below ecologically sustainable numbers,§ Pabst explained. ※This is a highly complex issue and very difficult to understand for a non-conservationist operating in Africa.§In total, Pabst says around 200 animals are hunted in Sango annually 每 or one 10th of 1% of the park＊s estimated 200,000 mammals.※These regulations and their strict control at Sango is the key factor of successful management through sustainable use which now [allows] us to donate 6,000 of our animals to Zinave,§ he said.The  (CIC), a global not-for-profit organisation that advocates for conservation and hunting, says that ※hunting tourism§ is an important tool to combat one of the biggest threats to African wildlife: poaching. They argue that so long as local communities benefit in some way from hunting funds 每 through jobs, payouts, or developing projects 每 they are far less likely to poach wildlife such as elephants and lions that they view as dangerous or destructive to their livelihood.※What would ＃ these local people [have] turned to in absence of alternative employment? Poaching!§ a spokesperson for CIC wrote in an email. ※As strange as it sounds, yes, the hunting of a few individual animals leads to the conservation of the species, killing of an animal saves the species.§Pabst say Sango is ※living proof§ that trophy hunting can support broad conservation goals. But Kalinina contends that trophy hunters only support conservation to buy themselves public acceptance. ※One wonders, take away the thrill of the kill ... would trophy hunters still invest in protecting our planet＊s last remaining wildlife?§Hunting proponents, however, contend that it＊s animal rights activists who don＊t realise their actions are actually hurting conservation 每 not helping it. ※Kenya＊s wildlife areas have decreased by almost 80% since the 1977 hunting ban was imposed, while at the same time being home to some 200 NGOs trying unsuccessfully to repair the damage done,§ Probst said. Hunting advocates commonly point to Kenya as an example of what happens when hunting is banned: they say habitat shrinks, populations decline, animals vanish because the economic incentive for local communities and the government to keep alive evaporates 每 eco-tourism just doesn＊t pay enough to keep animals alive and secure habitat, according to them.The reality, though, is complicated. Kenya is hardly the only African nation to see a catastrophic decline in wildlife: a  in 2010 found that Africa＊s big mammals had declined on average by 59% over the last 40 years 每 and this was .The reasons were complex according to scientists: habitat loss due to expanding agriculture and poaching for bushmeat or to feed the illegal wildlife trade, but underlying all of this: explosive human population growth. Kenya, like most African countries, has seen human population rise at a shocking rate in the past 40 years. In 1977, Kenya had 14.5 million people; today it has more than 48 million people. This trend is similar across Sub-Saharan Africa, whose population has basically tripled since 1977, hitting a billion people in 2015. This rise in human populations has placed crushing pressure on the continent＊s wildlife. Parks in southern Africa fared best in 2010 study, but the researchers noted that this region also had lower population densities and spent more money on its parks than its neighbours. The worst hit areas were West and Central African countries 每 a staggering 85% decline in wildlife 每 including a number of nations which allow trophy hunting. So, while hunting policy undoubtedly plays a role in animal populations, whether for the positive or negative 每 it＊s likely a more minor one than either critics or advocates claim.Like so many things: the devil is in the details. Hunting proponents argue that trophy hunting is essential to conservation efforts 每 but this argument only holds water if money actually makes its way to local communities or helps secure and manage habitat. Levies on trophy hunting may be important revenue for governments, but will only aid species if that money is then funneled back into conservation efforts and protected area management 每 something that is difficult to measure in many countries given high levels of corruption and other pressing priorities. A US congressional  by democrats on the committee on natural resources concluded, unsurprisingly, that ※trophy hunting is managed well in some areas and poorly in others§. ※In many cases, the laws, institutions, and capacity necessary to make trophy hunting benefit conservation are lacking,§ the report continues. A  by the IUCN 每 an organisation that supports trophy hunting 每 found similar ※mixed results§. Though it＊s take away message was more damning: ※hunting does not ... play a significant economic or social role and does not contribute at all to good governance§. The report criticised the sector for supporting few jobs, bringing little money to locals, and benefiting a few at the expense of the many. Still, one country that seems to have found a positive way to link conservation with trophy hunting is Namibia. Here, local communities have been given local control over communal land giving them an economic incentive to manage animal populations both for tourism and trophy hunting. Money goes directly to the local families who live with the animals. Now, Namibia is one of the few places in Africa where animal populations are on the rise. Both sides of the argument like to claim they have science and facts on their side, but things are never so simple. Research on the subject tends to assert that trophy hunting might support conservation 每 but the key here is ※might§. It depends on how well the programme is run and who is really benefiting. Scientists are concerned not only by some programmes that allow too many animals to be killed, but also the  of trophy hunters often targeting the biggest and most impressive animals. At the same time, many of the world＊s major conservation groups 每 including WWF, the Nature Conservancy, and the IUCN 每 continue to support trophy hunting, in part because they view the hunting community as a key ally in advancing conservation. As the debate simmers, one country to keep an eye on is Botswana. Botswana announced a ban on hunting in 2014, but it has come with costs. The plan included no exemption for Botswana＊s indigenous populations, such as the San People, that have depended on game meat for millennia. Many have been arrested and beaten simply for hunting on their ancestral land (the government has  it is rethinking this policy). Some villages have reportedly seen job declines due to lost revenue in trophy hunting. At the same time, Botswana maintains some of the strongest populations of African wildlife on the continent and is hugely popular with tourists. Kalinina pointed to Great Plain , an initiative run by National Geographic Explorers-in-Residence Dereck and Beverly Joubert, as an example of how to move beyond trophy hunting. Great Plains often purchases private hunting concessions to turn them into luxury photo-only tourism areas. Renowned lion experts, the Jouberts have long been critical of trophy hunting.※While killing one lion may generate $15,000-$30,000, the value of that animal to photographic tourism may be as much as $2m during the lion＊s lifetime,§ said Kalinina. But you first have to get tourists 每 and for Pabst, that＊s a problem in remote, lesser visited Zimbabwe. People＊s views of animals are undergoing a transformation. As a society, we are finally recognising that the world＊s non-human species are not the automatons that Rene Descartes insisted they were 每 a view that tainted animal science for centuries. Instead, we now know that other animals experience complex emotions, experience suffering and many show  (the number of animals known to use tools rises every year). In this debate, animal rights groups have moral outrage and increasingly, it seems, the public on their side. There haven＊t been a lot of polls taken on the issue of trophy hunting, but a  found that 84% of Albertans and 91% of British Canadians, including those living in rural areas, opposed trophy hunting. Try to think of another issue in which 80-90% of people polled would agree? Another  found that 62% of Americans believe big-game sport hunting should be outlawed, including 32% of American hunters. It may be that both trophy hunters and animal rights activists have something in common, though. Conservation is an important, but largely secondary, concern to both. Many animal rights activists see establishing the rights of animals as the ultimate goal. If conservation suffers from doing this (due to a plunge in funding), it may be a risk that many activists see as worth taking. On the other hand, many trophy hunters view the experience of the hunt as paramount. If the hunt promotes conservation all the better, but it may not be the primary goal when looking at an outfitter or pulling the trigger.Still, if the goal really is conservation, it comes down to money. If animal rights groups want to eliminate trophy hunting in Africa 每 without potentially undercutting some vital conservation efforts 每 they have to find alternative revenue streams that can make up for the gap, especially in places like remote Zimbabwe.On the other hand, if trophy hunters want to keep shooting they need to convince the world their hobby isn＊t a self-indulgent blood sport. They need to make sure hunting concessions are actually benefiting local people and the long-term survival of local species. They need to prove they are conservation-focused by demanding much better from the industry. ※Conservation is a great challenge that can only be achieved if we perceive Africa differently,§ Pabst said. Indeed, Africa is the only continent that didn＊t see a widespread extinction of its megafauna in the last 10,000 years 每 as such it is a time capsule of a truly lost world, a place of giants. But it＊s vanishing. Throughout most of Sub-Saharan Africa, habitat loss represents one, if not, the biggest threats to species. But here is Zinave national park: a habitat the size of Rhode Island that＊s just waiting for animals to return. And over the next eight weeks, Pabst 每 in one of the biggest overland transports of African animals yet 每 will be sending 900 impalas, 300 wildebeests, 200 zebras, African buffalo, and eland antelopes, 100 giraffes, and 50 kudus. Even 50 African elephants will be making their way to Zinave. If all goes according to plan: Zinave will be wild and full again. And such stories just prove: nothing in conservation is black and white. Well, except the zebras."																																																			
"astwards, the view feels like it goes on for a thousand miles. It must be 15km or maybe 20. Looking west, the sight lines are just as flat, though here the low-lying vistas are marshy, with rivulets snaking their way across the flat sands to the North Sea proper, several kilometres further downstream. In a country that has barely a hill to its name, south-west Jutland is Denmark at its flattest.The Wadden Sea, running from the northern Netherlands across Germany＊s north coast and up Denmark＊s west coast past the city of Esbjerg, is one of the world＊s largest and Europe＊s longest continuous stretch of wetlands. The Danish stretch of these panoramic mud flats, long curving tidal creeks, and mile upon mile of soft sand beaches, was awarded Unesco world heritage status in 2014, after being declared a national park (the country＊s largest) in 2008.A low-slung visitor centre, reopened this year near the ancient town of Ribe, is a striking addition to the region＊s tourist draws. Designed by Dorte Mandrup, Denmark＊s top female architect, it＊s all sharp angled lines that are all the more surprising when you realise they＊re made from one of the oldest building materials in the world, thatch.Thatch is cool these days, having returned to favour across Europe＊s sustainable architecture scene. Chosen so the building sits and indeed becomes part of the landscape and its flatland surroundings, it＊s also an obvious nod to the marshy borders, as well as local rural building tradition. The centre is already proving popular, notching up 30,000 visitors in its first three months. Inside, a beautiful display successfully mixes old-school exhibits 每 watercolour bird paintings for example 每 with new media interactivity.The wetlands are a unique and rich ecological habitat, home to diverse flora and fauna, with any number of delicacies living in the mudflats for hungry migratory birds on along what is delightfully known as the East Atlantic Flyover.Not surprisingly, the area is a twitchers＊ paradise: up to 12 million geese, waders, ducks and other migrating birds touch down during their epic migratory flights between Arctic sites such as Greenland＊s Disko Bay and, thousands of miles south, West African winter resting grounds. And these are not the only avian wonders; each spring and autumn the skies around and above this corner of Jutland come alive with the balletic displays of tens of thousands of starlings, murmurations known locally as the Black Sun.The region doesn＊t only attract bird-watchers, though. It has long been a favoured holiday destination for Danes, other Scandi nations and, particularly, Germans. Despite its reputation for being one of the windiest and rainiest parts of northern Europe, the summer comes with its share of hot, sunny days to enjoy in one of the area＊s . (UK tourist nunbers have dipped since a ferry services between Esbjerg and Harwich ended in 2014.)Those who make the journey there will discover a Denmark several gears slower than the more obvious go to＊s, Copenhagen, or Denmark＊s second city, Aarhus, one of this year＊s European capitals of culture.All along West Jutland＊s coastland the towns, villages, and countryside tick to a different pace. Esbjerg, once the heart of the South Jutland fishing industry, is the exception, still an industrial hub exporting Vestas wind turbines around the world. By contrast, Ribe, a half-hour journey south, has a peaceful, time-warp ambience.Ribe (pop 8,000) is Denmark＊s 每 and indeed Scandinavia＊s 每 oldest town, a postcard-perfect picture of tranquility and atmospheric historic buildings. A 13th-century cathedral sits on the recently restored town square, amid a tapestry of red brick buildings that include two more firsts, Denmark＊s oldest town hall and hotel, .I made my way down the main street, Overdammen, a honeypot of shops and restaurants, before dipping into a fishing museum close to the river Ribe, filled to the gills with exhibits from the bygone fishing era.Not surprisingly, given this is Denmark, cycle routes criss-crossing the town into the flatlands: one runs along river, past the town＊s well placed youth hostel. The coast and visitor centre can be reached by bus, bike or on foot, and there are several campsites in the countryside nearby. Those who＊ve come searching for their inner Viking, can head to Ribe Viking Museum in town, and, a couple of kilometres south in Lustrup, the , where you can commune with characters in full Viking garb, living the dream.A causeway leads out to Mand?, one of several sand islands, which sit pancake flat and just about above sea-level amid the mudflats. The road is only passable at low-tide, and a tractor-bus trundles out from near the visitor centre. All of 60 people live mainly on seaward side of the island, close to one of the Wadden Sea＊s sandier beaches.

" don＊t want to jinx it so I＊m only whispering but, shhh, we may be blessed with a half-decent butterfly summer. Last week, I saw a purple emperor, tipsy on sap from an old oak, lurching around a meadow on a deeply overcast day that normally only brings out the ringlets and meadow browns.Like most of our 59 native butterflies, the midsummer-loving purple emperor has emerged ten days earlier than usual. On the exuberant rewilded farmland of , there are more emperors flying than anywhere else in the country. This iridescent beauty inspires great obsession and its leading devotees,  of the National Trust and Butterfly Conservation＊s Neil Hulme, spotted 148 emperors in one day last week. That＊s extreme butterflying.I＊m happy enough with more mundane pleasures. After two years of  my garden 每 basically, liberating my lawn 每 my wild areas are dancing with butterflies whose caterpillars feed on grass 每 ringlets, meadow browns, gatekeepers and the Essex skipper. It＊s a tiny sign of how quickly insects can bounce back. Creating wildlife-friendly habitat is hugely rewarding.Another good sign lies in the nettles. I stopped by a patch in intensively farmed Norfolk this week and found dozens of spiky black peacock and black-yellow-and-green small tortoiseshell caterpillars. Look on any sizeable, south or west-facing nettle patch this week and you＊ll probably find clusters of peacock caterpillars. These should be on the wing before July＊s end.One caution:  since scientific monitoring began in 1976. We＊re guilty of ※shifting baseline syndrome§ if we get too delighted by modest improvements.

"People across the UK are underestimating the impact of the  crisis in their local areas, according to a new survey.Almost two thirds of respondents said they were concerned about the issue of air pollution, but only one in 10 said they thought the air they breathe is bad.Last week the Guardian revealed that there are  where pupils as young as three are being exposed to illegal levels of air pollution that can cause serious long term health problems. And government statistics show 38 our of 43 UK ※air quality zones§ ., which carried out the latest survey, said that despite the growing evidence many people 每 particularly outside London 每 were still unaware of the dangers of air pollution.※With only 1 in 10 British adults rating their air quality as poor despite swaths of the country breaking legal limits for air pollution, it seems the message about the scale and danger of air pollution isn＊t getting through,§ said Oliver Hayes, a Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner.※Often you can＊t see it or smell it, but it＊s there 每 and air pollution is risking the health of an entire generation of children.§To coincide with the findings, Friends of the Earth has launched what they hope will be the ※biggest ever citizen science air pollution experiment§.

It also found that every London borough has recorded illegally high levels of air pollution in the last two years.Hayes said: ※Whilst Londoners are starting to understand the air pollution crisis, in part due to welcome attention from politicians and the media, outside of the capital it＊s a very different story.§Friends of the Earth said it hoped thousands of people will join in the charity＊s experiment so it can create a comprehensive national air pollution picture.

"Scientists and science supporters will take to the streets in a global  on 22 April . What began as a small Facebook group in the US capital, Washington DC has spiralled into a global phenomenon that will now see marches and other events in .It is great news that so many people are prepared to stand up and defend the need for evidence-based thinking and the scientific method. But it is also a sad comment on our times that a  is needed at all. Post-truth populism has infected democracies around the world, scientific objectivity is under threat from multiple sources and there seems a real danger of falling into a modern dystopian dark age.It is clear that the old days of scientists staying in the lab, publishing papers in scholarly journals, and otherwise letting the facts speak for themselves are over. As the Harvard science historian  reminds us: ※The facts don＊t speak for themselves because we live in a world where so many people are trying to silence facts.§ In her book, Merchants of Doubt, Oreskes wrote about these efforts from the tobacco industry onwards; science denialist attempts that are paralleled in today＊s climate sceptic, anti-vaccine and anti-GMO movements.These campaigners against truth take great pains to deny the existence of scientific consensus on their different issues. The fact that 97% of the peer-reviewed literature on climate change supports the consensus that most of global warming is human-induced is dismissed as mere elitism. But as Dr Sarah Evanega, director of the Alliance for Science at Cornell, writes: ※The values we defend are those of the Enlightenment, not the establishment.§ Expertise is real, and we reject it at our peril. Perhaps the most inspiring aspect of the March for Science, and what may prove to be its most enduring legacy, is its truly global nature. Science is not western; it is everywhere and for everyone. I have worked with  colleagues to help get marches off the ground in Bangladesh, Nigeria, Uganda, Venezuela, Chile and other places. In between long Skype calls about logistics, fundraising, and media outreach I watched the lights flash on as the number of marches on the global map kept on increasing. It was like watching the world light up with knowledge.Bangladesh March for Science＊s lead organiser Arif Hossain says: ※I am marching to let the world know that we are united for science in Bangladesh. We have 160 million people to feed in the changed climate, and together we will make a better day with science and innovation.§Although the issues of most concern vary in different locations, appreciation of the need for science is global. As Nkechi Isaac, an organiser of the March for Science in Abuja, Nigeria, says: ※Science is revolutionary. It holds the key to constant development and improvement for addressing climate change, food shortage and challenges in medicine. Science holds the solution to our food security.§Nigerians can testify to the tragic effects of anti-science activism. Efforts to eradicate polio in the country were held up for years because of conspiracy theories spread by those suspicious of modern medicine and vaccines. People die when science is denied. So here＊s what we will be marching for. It＊s time to enter the post-post-truth era. And there is no time to lose.

"The loss of coral reefs caused by rising sea temperatures could cost $1 trillion globally, a  has projected, with the loss of Queensland＊s Great Barrier Reef alone costing that region 1m visitors a year, imperilling 10,000 jobs and draining $1bn from the economy.The longest global coral bleaching event on record, which began in 2014 and has , has given reefs little chance to recover, and should be a ※wake-up call§ to act to save the natural and economic assets, the Climate Council＊s Lesley Hughes said.※The extraordinary devastation being experienced on the  is due to the warming of our oceans, driven by the burning of coal, oil and gas,§ Hughes said. ※It would have been virtually impossible for this to have occurred without climate change.§Hughes argued it was a false dichotomy in public debate ※to pit the environment against the economy§. ※This isn＊t just an environmental issue. The Great Barrier Reef is one of Australia＊s greatest economic assets. It＊s responsible for bringing in more than $7bn each year to our economy, while also supporting the livelihoods of around 70,000 people. A healthy Great Barrier Reef underpins the tourism industry and the jobs that it supports.§The $1 trillion figure for the value of the world＊s coral reefs is derived from a  led by Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the University of Queensland＊s Global Change Institute, which found that worldwide,  across 50 nations. are expected to offer Queensland reefs some relief from the bleaching events of 2016 and 2017, though this is expected to be only temporary, and could be offset by the physical damage caused by the Category 4 tropical cyclone.Professor Will Steffen, climate councillor and emeritus professor at the ANU, said bleaching events were likely to become more frequent and more severe in Australia over the next two to three decades, which could devastate the long-term health of the reef and its ability to regenerate.※The only way to protect coral reefs in Australia and around the world is to stop greenhouse gas emissions. Australia is the caretaker of the Great Barrier Reef and we are lagging well behind the rest of the developed world when it comes to doing our part to effectively combat climate change.※Emissions are flatlining in China  and in other OECD countries. In comparison, Australia＊s emissions continue to grow. We＊ve got to stop and then reverse this trend and we＊ve got to do it now. There is no time to lose.§Australian emissions grew by 0.8% in 2016, the council＊s report says.Steffen said the opening of new coalmines in Queensland＊s Galilee Basin was inconsistent with protecting the Great Barrier reef, and reducing Australian 每 and global 每 carbon emissions.This week the Australian Research Council＊s centre of excellence for coral reef studies , which assessed 800 individual reefs.The surveys show the 2016 and 2017 mass bleaching events have now affected two-thirds of the reef. Only the reef＊s southern third has emerged unscathed. This year＊s bleaching event was most intense in the reef＊s middle third, while last year＊s was further north.The federal and state governments＊ efforts to save the reef have been laid out in a joint . Combined, they spend about $200m annually to protect and preserve the reef. 每 including offering financial incentives to farmers who reduce nitrogen and sediment run-off into the reef 每 environment minister Josh Frydenberg said the government was working with local communities to improve the reef＊s health and maintain it for future generations.※These new projects complement existing efforts and demonstrate how we can make private investment work effectively alongside public funding to maximise results for the reef from each dollar invested. Collaborative partnerships like the ones announced today are critical to address the threats and pressures faced by the reef.§Both the federal and state governments support Indian conglomerate Adani＊s  in the Galilee Basin in central Queensland, which environmental groups and climate scientists have argued will cause massive carbon emissions, and endanger local species and groundwater supplies."																																																			
"A new  looks at changes in solar activity and carbon dioxide levels over the past 420 million years. The authors found that on our current path, by mid-century humans will be causing the fastest climate change in approximately 50 million years, and if we burn all available fossil fuels, we＊ll cause the fastest change in the entire 420 million year record.The study relates to a scientific conundrum known as the ※§ 每 that early in Earth＊s history, solar output was 30% less intense than it is today, and yet the planet was warm enough to have a liquid ocean. A stronger greenhouse effect due to higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may be one explanation.Over time, solar output has grown stronger, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have fallen due to an effect known as  and an increase in plant life. The authors of this study found that over the past 420 million years, the slow heating of the sun and slow decline of the greenhouse effect have roughly offset each other, leading to a fairly stable long-term global climate.In particular, as shown in the first chart above, Earth＊s climate has been fairly stable over the past several million years. The wiggles in the blue line represent transitions in and out of ice ages, due to wobbles in the Earth＊s orbit around the sun, amplified by changes in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (these are known as ).The bottom frame in the chart shows the change in forcing (global energy imbalance) caused by the combination of changes in solar activity and the greenhouse effect. When the line is flat, the Earth＊s energy balance is stable, and thus so is its climate. When there＊s a steep change, something is upsetting that balance and causing a rapid climate change. The five colored lines toward the end of the chart show potential pathways we＊ll follow, depending on how much fossil fuels humans burn over the coming decades.In every case the line is already quite steep due to the hundreds of billions of tons of carbon pollution humans have dumped into the atmosphere thus far. The size of the global energy imbalance we＊ve caused is already on par with those previous blue wiggles 每 Earth＊s ice age transitions. If we keep burning lots of fossil fuels, we could soon cause higher carbon dioxide levels and faster climate change than the Earth has seen in 50 million years. If we burn all available fossil fuel reserves (the black ※Wink12k§ line), we＊ll see faster climate change than in the entire 420 million year record.It＊s an alarming proposition. Climate deniers will often argue against taking action to curb carbon pollution because  and . One Republican congressman repeated these talking points in .

Second, similar past rapid climate changes . Third, the sun＊s cooler past helped keep temperatures lower. As renowned climate scientist Wallace Broecker once said, ※The climate system is an angry beast, and we are poking at it with sticks.§As this new study shows, our poking sticks are getting bigger and bigger, and we＊re poking the beast faster and faster. Meanwhile, climate deniers are egging us on because the beast has been angered in the past, and we＊re not sure just how soon it will decide to maul us."

In his book , Foster spends a chapter living as an urban fox, and scampers around Bethnal Green on all fours, nudging fortnight-old mouldy pizza slices with his nose. I had always assumed some degree of opposition between humans and foxes 每 because of the effect they have on fences and lawns, and because of the love-hate relationships explored in documentaries such as 2013＊s . But Foster disagrees. His friends ※are only too glad when a bit of the natural world deigns to nest under their garden shed ＃ I think we have lessons to learn from the foxes about how better to be human. We all feel dispossessed. We don＊t feel properly local. Foxes can lead us to possess a place and therefore feel at home in it in a way that we don＊t normally.§It is true that foxes are the ultimate outsider, their passage from the countryside to the city echoing the migration of humans during the industrial revolution. Increasingly at home in our homes (on all those mugs and cushions) and gardens (in real life) they have never shaken their image as visitant, immigrant. They patrol their territories, a task they perform on a sort of never-ending loop, but their presence in towns can still seem startling, transgressive. They are native but appear intrusive. They are predator and prey. They are wild, yet occupy all our most cultivated spaces, our lawns and borders. Maybe these are themes we can relate to. Are foxes proliferating in popular culture because we feel increasingly alienated ourselves?※They have been the ultimate icon of anti-establishment feeling,§ Foster says. ※They have always been the ones that, with fewer resources, have got the upper hand, or upper paw, over the slower forces of the establishment.§ Certainly literature, film and music are full of foxes who thwart the odds with imagination or strategy, from Aesop through  to ＊s video for , in which a fox enchants its hunters and turns them into foxes. As Taylor Swift put it, and , ※They got the cages, they got the boxes and guns / They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run.§ Maybe it＊s not so much a case of us and them these days as a more inclusive, wilder us.Lucy Jones, whose book  was published last year and who owns some fox socks and a fox candle holder, believes that ※the fox on the cushion and the fox on the necklace are a different character to the fox in the garden. It＊s a muted, antiseptic character, it＊s anthropomorphised and it＊s a clean beast. Some people are happier with that.§ She is right that it is quite a leap from wearing a fox on a sweater or chucking a foxy cushion on your sofa to warming to the real thing. But I wonder if the more foxes, of any kind, we see, the more they are on our minds.The truth is, almost everyone who lives in a place where foxes live has a fox story.Since the first week I took my story to a workshop, all kinds of people have shared tales of their own encounters. Given the number of fox videos that go viral 每 like the one in which  每 it seems clear that foxes capture human imaginations, and the common thread is the idea that when a fox and human cross paths, some sort of meaningful exchange takes place. ※You don＊t get it with birds or squirrels,§ says MaryCarol Hunter, an academic researching human connections with nature. ※They look at you sideways.§A fox will meet a human eye without flinching. Its first response is rarely to run, and in the space that its hesitation creates, it is easy to intuit curiosity, interest. The moment can feel like an interaction in a shared language, which might be why foxes are so often anthropomorphised or deemed to hold some kind of answer (see the fox  or ※What does the fox say?§) The character in my book takes this sense of communication to extremes. But, outside of fiction, I wonder how prepared we are to risk seeming strange in order to interact with wildness. is the photographer who took the image of a fox that appears on the posters for .

If anyone else came walking down the street they would run off and hide, leaving me sat there by myself in the street with no foxes around, looking a bit weird.§ It requires a degree of immersion to believe that it is stranger to sit on the pavement alone than to sit with a family of foxes. But this is the point.Hobson, who has a ※normal amount§ of fox stuff, including a fox mug and a fox bath mat, had to wait for his most prized fox encounter. A few months after he completed his project, he returned to the spot where he used to find the foxes, and squeaked. At first, nothing happened. He sat down, ※and this fox just appeared, came over, and sat next to me. We looked at each other and weren＊t quite sure.

Hunter＊s research, which asked participants to seek out regular ※nature experiences§ in order to ascertain an optimum dose, found that levels of the stress hormone cortisol dropped after a 20-30 minute experience of nature, in a local park, or even sitting in the front porch taking the air.

"US scientists are set to send aerosol injections 20km up into the earth＊s stratosphere in the world＊s biggest solar geoengineering programme to date, to study the potential of a future tech-fix for global warming.The $20m (?16m) Harvard University project will launch within weeks and aims to establish whether the technology can safely simulate the atmospheric cooling effects of a volcanic eruption, if a last ditch bid to halt climate change is one day needed.Scientists hope to complete two small-scale dispersals of first water and then calcium carbonate particles by 2022. Future tests could involve seeding the sky with aluminium oxide 每 or even diamonds. ※This is not the first or the only university study,§ said Gernot Wagner, the project＊s co-founder, ※but it is most certainly the largest, and the most comprehensive.§Janos Pasztor, Ban Ki-moon＊s assistant climate chief at the UN who now leads , said that the Harvard scientists would only disperse minimal amounts of compounds in their tests, under strict university controls. ※The real issue here is something much more challenging,§ he said ※What does moving experimentation from the lab into the atmosphere mean for the overall path towards eventual deployment?§ advocates stress that any attempt at a solar tech fix is years away and should be viewed as a compliment to 每 not a substitute for 每 aggressive emissions reductions action.But the Harvard team, in a  for the project, suggest a redirection of one percent of current climate mitigation funds to geoengineering research, and argue that the planet could be covered with a solar shield for as little as $10bn a year.Some senior UN climate scientists view such developments , fearing a cash drain from proven mitigation technologies such as wind and solar energy, to ones carrying the .Kevin Trenberth, a lead author for the UN＊s intergovernmental panel on climate change, said that despair at sluggish climate action, and the rise of Donald Trump were feeding the current tech trend. ※But solar geoengineering is not the answer,§ he said. ※Cutting incoming solar radiation affects the weather and hydrological cycle. It promotes drought. It destabilizes things and could cause wars. The side effects are many and our models are just not good enough to predict the outcomes§Natural alterations to the earth＊s radiation balance can be short-lasting, but terrifying.

"As a scientist working for decades on national and global water and climate challenges, I must speak out against what I see as an assault on America＊s water resources.I grew up in New York in the 1960s hearing about massive Polychlorinated Biphenyl 每 a toxic chemical used as a coolant 每 contamination in the Hudson River and the threatened extinction of bald eagles and ospreys from eating contaminated fish. I remember watching on television Ohio＊s Cuyahoga River burning. I remember scientists warning about the death of the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay from uncontrolled industrial pollution. I remember not being able to swim at beaches polluted with raw sewage. And I remember the public debate and bipartisan enthusiasm for federal action to clean up our waters 每 enthusiasm that led to passage of one of the nation＊s foundational environmental laws, the Clean Water Act, enacted by the US Congress in 1972 over Richard Nixon＊s veto.This law and the related federal regulations reduced water pollution and protected some of the nation＊s rivers and lakes, but they are incomplete, only partially implemented, and increasingly outdated in the face of new threats from unregulated contaminants, worsening climatic changes, failing water infrastructure and direct political assault.Donald Trump . This claim has proven to be hollow. Since taking office, the president, administration officials, and the Republican-led Congress have moved aggressively to roll back decades of water-quality protections put in place by previous Republican and Democratic administrations. These moves benefit industrial polluters rather than local communities, hinder progress toward cleaning up contaminated water and deteriorating ecosystems and worsen public health risks.To address these problems, the Obama administration developed new rules to remove mercury from municipal sewage; impose limits on the amount of toxic and bioaccumulative water pollutants such as arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium that can be released from power plants; control previously unregulated pesticides; stop the dumping of coal wastes into streams and clarified authority for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers to extend protections to around 60% of the water bodies in the United States 每 the so-called Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, rule, also known as the Clean Water Rule. The  and Congress have moved to rescind every one of these environmental protections.Immediately after Trump＊s inauguration, the EPA announced the agency＊s intention to cancel the new regulation to cut mercury pollution in urban wastewater. Mercury is a persistent neurotoxin affecting the brain and nervous system and  that more than 75,000 infants in the US each year have an increased risk of learning disabilities associated with prenatal exposure to methylmercury. The largest single source of mercury contamination in urban wastewater comes from dental offices and the new rule required dental offices to install inexpensive and effective equipment to capture rather than dump mercury. In April, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt proposed to postpone the compliance dates for meeting the new limits on toxic water pollutants from power plants. This rule would have reduced pollutant releases by 1.4bn pounds a year 每 including chemicals that lead to cancer and other illnesses in humans, lowered IQ in children, and deformities and reproductive damage in fish and wildlife.The Clean Water Rule was published in June 2015 after years of scientific study, more than 400 public hearings, and literally a million public comments. It provides a critical tool for tackling persistent pollution problems from pesticides, fertilizers and industrial chemicals in water that previously lacked regulations.Eliminating the Waters of the United Statesrule was an explicit objective of the , and Trump signed an  in February 2017 asking the EPA and US Army Corps of Engineers to review and either rescind or revise it. In late June, the EPA  it would move to completely replace it, removing protections from vast areas of the country.Finally, Trump＊s proposed budget imposes massive cuts to federal water-quality protections. The EPA office that develops standards for pollution in drinking water, already years behind in setting limits for unregulated pollutants, would have its budget cut in half. The Superfund program, responsible for cleaning up severely polluted industrial sites, including many contaminating or threatening groundwater, would be cut 25% and enforcement would be cut 40%. Programs that support environmental cleanup in Long Island Sound, Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes, San Francisco Bay, and other waterways would be cut to zero. The EPA＊s office for scientific research and development would be cut in half. Federal grants to states to identify and prevent leaks from underground storage tanks and programs to reduce lead exposure, like that seen recently in Flint, Michigan, would be eliminated. If we do nothing, undrinkable water could be one of Trump＊s most poisonous legacies.The good news is that Americans care enormously about clean water. The annual Gallup Poll on the environment ranks worries about water pollution above any other environmental issue,  than they＊ve been since 2001. Scientists, public health officials, and environmental groups are also fighting back.  in federal court arguing that the Trump administration doesn＊t have the legal authority to delay these protections, hasn＊t given public notice or allowed public debate, is ignoring proven science and has acted to prioritize the interests of the coal and chemical industries over public health.

Some Republican members of Congress have publicly  over the severity of the proposed federal budget cuts to environmental protection.We＊ve come a long way from the era of unregulated dumping of chemicals in our streams, burning rivers, and dying ecosystems. I＊m optimistic that the goal of clean, fishable, swimmable waters nationwide is achievable. But the Republican party is moving rapidly to become the party of dirty water.

"The Guardian＊s Azerbaijani Laundromat investigation (, 5 September) has uncovered thousands of covert payments as part of a European lobbying effort. But the article doesn＊t mention the elephant in the room. Azerbaijan is particularly keen to present a positive image in Europe because it needs significant European support for its flagship project 每 the Southern Gas Corridor 每 despite the regime＊s serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and election rigging.The corridor, one of the biggest infrastructure projects undertaken by the fossil fuel industry with a total cost of about $45bn, will carry gas from  to Europe. Powerful interests from fossil fuel corporations to European governments are pushing through this unnecessary project against the will of communities and threatening human rights and a safe climate.The Southern  Corridor and its importance to the Aliyev regime is the missing piece of the puzzle and partly explains why the Azerbaijani regime is so heavily involved in lobbying at the European level and related money-laundering activities. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the latest fraud scandal to hit Britain is that it comes despite repeated government promises to crack down on those who exploit weaknesses in tax and?governance laws. In 2013 ,?then prime minister, pledged to put an end to tax avoidance through tougher transparency rules in the UK and?our overseas territories.

Tax avoidance 每 often through tax havens 每 costs developing countries billions of dollars each year that could pay for schools and life-saving healthcare.

" continued to produce and sell toxic industrial chemicals known as PCBs for eight years after learning that they posed hazards to public health and the environment, according to legal analysis of documents put online in a vast searchable archive. More than 20,000 internal memos, minuted meetings, letters and other documents have been published in the new archive, many for the first time. Most were obtained from legal discovery and access to documents requests digitised by , which was launched by the Bioscience Resource Project and the Center for Media and Democracy. Chiron Return contributed some documents to the library. Bill Sherman, the assistant attorney general for the US state of Washington 每 which is suing Monsanto for PCB clean-up costs 每 said the archive contained damning evidence the state had previously been unaware of. He told the Guardian: ※If authentic, these records confirm that Monsanto knew that their PCBs were harmful and pervasive in the environment, and kept selling them in spite of that fact. They knew the dangers, but hid them from the public in order to profit.§As well as the Washington case, Monsanto is facing PCB contamination suits from city authorities in Seattle, Spokane, Long Beach, Portland, San Diego, San Jose, Oakland and Berkeley.

The European commission  into the merger by 22 August, amid  in Europe and the US.Monsanto＊s vice president of global strategy, Scott Partridge, did not dispute the authenticity of the documents revealed in the online cache but denied any impropriety. He told the Guardian: ※More than 40 years ago, the former Monsanto voluntarily stopped production and sale of PCBs prior to any federal requirement to do so. At the time Monsanto manufactured PCBs, they were a legal and approved product used in many useful applications. Monsanto has no liability for pollution caused by those who used or discharged PCBs into the environment.§ that were mass produced by Monsanto between 1935 and 1977 for use as coolants and lubricators in electrical equipment such as transformers and capacitors. By 1979, they had been completely banned in the US and elsewhere, after a weight of evidence linking them to  that ranged from chloracne and Yusho (rice oil disease) to cancer, and to environmental harm.Yet a decade earlier, one Monsanto  in the archive from October 1969, singled out by Sherman, suggests that Monsanto was even then aware of the risks posed by PCB use. In a section on ※damage to the ecological system by contamination from PCBs,§ it said: ※The evidence proving the persistence of these compounds and their universal presence in the environment is beyond questioning.§※Direct lawsuits are possible§ it continued, because ※customers using the products have not been officially notified about known effects nor [do] our labels carry this information.§ The plan offered three courses of action, each accompanied by ※profit and liability§ flow charts. The options were: ※Do nothing§, ※discontinue manufacture of all PCBs§ or ※respond responsibly,§ admitting environmental contaminations, and taking remedial action. Sherman said: ※At the same time that Monsanto was telling the public that that PCBs were safe, they were literally graphing their potential legal liability against the lost profits and public image boost that might accompany being responsible and honest. At the end of the day, Monsanto went for the profits instead of for public health and environmental safety.§ from September 1969 lists PCB leakages in the Gulf Coast, Great Lakes and San Francisco Bay areas and outlines potential cleanup actions. But the memo also says Monsanto＊s strategy should be to ※let govt prove its case on a case by case basis§. It says: ※We can prove some things are ok at low concentration. Give Monsanto some defence. We can＊t defend vs everything. Some animals or fish or insects will be harmed.§ Two months later, a  firmed up this warning: ※From the standpoint of reproduction, the PCBs are highly toxic to birds,§ it said. The presentation described the firm＊s Aroclor 1254 and 1260 products as ※the most serious offenders§ in what it admitted was ※a worldwide ecological problem§.Production of Aroclor 1254 and other PCBs continued until .

Wallonia＊s agriculture minister  ※the most serious economic crisis Belgium has known since the war§.Monsanto began manufacturing PCBs in 1935, after acquiring the Swann chemical company. It went on to dominate global production. Adverse health effects linked to PCBs had first forced their way on to the company＊s agenda , when autopsies revealed that three Monsanto workers had died from severe liver damage after handling the substance. These concerns ratcheted up several levels in 1966, when a landmark study by Soren Jensen discovered the bioaccumulation of PCBs in Baltic fish and sea birds. By the 1970s, nearly 80% of the Baltic Sea＊s three female seal species were found to be infertile, and correlations with PCB exposure were soon established.By 1972, Monsanto had voluntarily stopped selling PCBs for all uses except in enclosed electrical applications. In the same year, Sweden and Japan imposed moratoriums on ※open§ PCB use and manufacture.In the US, an  called for the use of PCBs to be restricted to ※essential or non-replaceable uses which involve minimal direct human exposure since they can have adverse effects on human health.§But their report found ※no toxicological or ecological data§ to indicate a threat to human health from levels thought present in the environment, although the data available to the task force to was ※inadequate§, its authors said.In 1975, as  ※highly toxic§ and ※a significant hazard to human health and the environment,§ Monsanto  that they did not just affect animals but ※can have permanent effects on the human body§.

"The  government and the Katherine mayor have called for locals to be given the same blood testing and support provided to other communities impacted by Defence＊s firefighting foam contamination scandal.Drinking water in the town of Katherine, in the territory＊s top end, has been contaminated by the decades-long use of toxic firefighting foam at the nearby Tindal air force base.The same firefighting chemicals 每 known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (Pfas) 每 have contaminated Defence bases, fire stations and airports across the country. Early investigations by Defence last year showed groundwater near the base was  the safe threshold for drinking water. The government maintains the drinking water itself, however, remains safe. On Wednesday, the federal and territory governments announced they would impose  to limit the use of contaminated water.A new water-treatment facility will also be purchased by Defence to treat contaminated bore water, which combines with river water to create the town＊s drinking supply. Despite the measures, the federal government is still  of local residents, or include them in a broader epidemiological study and $54m assistance package offered to other affected areas. It＊s at odds with the government-funded blood testing provided in two of the worst-hit areas: Williamtown in NSW and Oakey in Queensland. The NT health minister, Natasha Fyles, has repeatedly called for the same measures to be afforded to residents of the top end. She told Guardian Australia the federal government had so far resisted those calls, instead delaying action until a more detailed investigation of the Katherine site can take place. That investigation is likely to take until March next year. ※We feel that our community should be on an equal footing to those in other parts of Australia,§ Fyles said. ※We＊d like to see the same services provided around Australia, provided in Katherine. We think that＊s important,§ she said.The water treatment facility will only be able to treat one megalitre of water a day when it becomes operational later this year. That is a small proportion of the water used in Katherine, particularly during the peak of the dry season.The Katherine mayor, Fay Miller, has warned the water treatment facility, while diluting the Pfas chemicals to some degree, would not be enough. ※It will certainly reduce it, there＊s no doubt about that, but it＊s not going to be able to deal with the 10 megalitres a day,§ she told Guardian Australia. Miller, who has lived in the town for almost 30 years, said she＊d like to see blood testing for those who wanted it. ※Why not give them that peace of mind, and why not allow it?§ she said. ※If people would like to have the Pfas testing done, I don＊t think there is any reason for them not to have it done.§But Miller warned blood testing, other than giving peace of mind, would not help address the problem. She urged calm and said the community had become worried due to ※media hype§.※People need to be calm, need to be measured and calm. I know that we＊re all doing what we can,§ she said.The Australian government was warned directly about its use of Pfas as early as 2000, when the United States environmental protection agency wrote to senior government officials. The letter, obtained by Guardian Australia, warns of possible links to adverse human health impacts. Defence and Australia＊s airports took years to begin phasing out their use of the firefighting foam, and took even longer to begin investigations for possible contamination. State-based environmental protection agencies, responsible for policing chemical use by firefighting services, took almost a decade to act. The defence minister has been contacted for a response.

"George Monbiot＊s call to reconsider how we name things (, 9?August) is a timely contribution to a confusing world. But one word that both he and the majority of online contributors have ignored is ※prosperity§. That, after all, is why humans engage in economic activity: they believe it will make things better. There is, however, a fundamental problem with the way we have arranged our economic affairs. By treating the natural world as an infinite thing, ※external§ to the economy (except as a never-ending supply of resources) we have built a massive endeavour to take natural resources and make them into things that are then disposed of, generally after a fairly brief period of human enjoyment.Everyone I speak to readily accepts that under this system the planet must eventually ※run out§, but they cannot see an alternative to ※prosperity§. The conversation we need to have is not how we name things but how we do things.Margaret Thatcher＊s speech to the UN general assembly in 1989 recognised that human economic activity was having a fundamental impact on our planet but somehow failed to recognise that all these activities are driven by incentives. In the rich, polluting world the survival incentive has long been replaced by the prosper incentive, but our rules of economy still behave as if we can have it all despite a population level almost 20 times that of when the rules were derived.Earth Overshoot Day for 2017 fell on 2 August. For the rest of this year our economy is using up the reserves of the natural world, yet we continue to subsidise the use of fossil fuels to the tune of $5tn (, theguardian.com, 7 August). Adam Smith observed that man＊s desire to improve his lot is a powerful one: aspiration is a real human need. But if the economy really is going to deliver prosperity, we need one that can work with the natural world rather than one that consumes it, whatever it is called. George Monbiot has issued a timely reminder that we need new words to describe our natural world and the growing threats to it. The incessant use of impenetrable language risks spawning public apathy instead of reverence for nature and passion to act. Nowhere is this greater than in a post-EU world where the names of the vital tools that protect our air, water and wildlife 每 directives, preambles and statutory instruments 每 mean little to most of us.The government＊s long-awaited 25-year environment plan and parliamentary bills on farming and fisheries provide an early opportunity to change the narrative. Will they seize this generational opportunity to set us on a new path of reconnection with our natural world, or will they see us retreat into the familiar bastion of techno-speak? I＊m hoping for the former. One way to encourage a language full of ※natural wonder§ would be to move the wonderful  from the back of the paper to the editorial pages, where more readers would encounter it. For once I find myself in total agreement with the Trump administration (, 8 August). Phrases such as ※climate change§ and ※global warming§ are scientifically misleading, giving an entirely inaccurate impression. I would certainly ban them and insist on the use of phrases such as ※global overheating§, ※climate crisis§, ※world on fire§ and ※impending disaster§ as giving a much truer representation of what＊s really going on. Re the US Department of Agriculture＊s instruction to avoid ※climate change§ in favour of ※weather extremes§, this brings back memories of when, some years ago on the TV show Three of a Kind, Lenny Henry commented that, as part of the attempt to rebuild the appalling reputation of Windscale, it was to be renamed Sellafield ※because it sounds nicer. And in future, radiation will be known as magic moonbeams.§ Trump＊s government is not alone in its use of euphemisms. In England the government＊s project to introduce a scheme of private health insurance is labelled ※NHS reform§. And the associated project to slash, trash and privatise our health service has to be called ※sustainability and transformation partnerships§. Just this morning I＊ve seen an advertisement for a health conference where colleagues from Cumbria will describe ※improving patient journeys across their STP footprint§. I assume that the ambulance service across the fells will be improved, though I worry about a?surge in fractured metatarsals.

We drop to our knees, disregarding our clothing, to examine the inch-high smear of greenery. It is lively with spiders and beetles, racing through the tiny leaves like deer running through a forest. At last we capture a copper peacock beetle, , which is not as showy as the name suggests.

Lake-side and river muds and stones are the likely original habitat for some of our arable weeds. Their rushed life-cycle in these temporary habitats is adapted to the relentless plough."																																																			
"George Monbiot makes some useful points in his article bemoaning the influence of the lobbying power of the motor industry (, 2 August). He proposes a modal transport shift to more coach travel and investment in nuclear power plants to power our electric cars. He ignores completely, as usual, the solar option with smaller electric cars and electric bikes and charged by photovoltaics on homes, at work and in public places. In 1993, I bought Hannibal, the 750kg fibreglass Kewet El Jet electric car that we used for a decade to take the children to school, go shopping and to train and bus stations. This first British solar car was largely powered by the 4kWp PV roof on my Oxford ecohouse. Monbiot also ignores the huge trend towards using electric bikes that can be easily solar charged at home or work. We love our cars and bikes, but the trick is to make them much smaller, lighter and solar powered, used locally and to connect with public transport systems for longer distances, so decrying any need for building inevitably toxic new nuclear power stations at all. Car size does matter now if we, as a society, are serious about surviving safely into the 22nd century, so let＊s have less of Jeremy Clarkson on TV and more solar-powered Good Lives. It＊s the mindset that has to change first, then the hardware. George Monbiot and several of your readers (Letters,  and ) have drawn attention to the folly of the government＊s 2040 initiative. It does not need 2020 hindsight to see that the demands on electricity generation will rocket in order to support a nation using only electric cars. Where will this electricity come from and at whose expense?What is still perplexing is Mr Monbiot＊s continued support for nuclear power. Has?he overlooked the massive clean-up and decommissioning bills which are accumulating? Is he dismissing nuclear accidents as inconvenient truths? And relying on the ※burial§ method for centuries to come? Nuclear (at least the fission sort) is still only an interim solution at best. There is only one way that an energy budget can be balanced in the long term without polluting: through renewables. Rather than consider whether to support electric cars or nuclear, we should install as much renewable generation as possible and perhaps, for once, live within its limits.A real joined-up policy would invest in expanding a nationalised rail network and encourage more people to travel by train than car. Two-way rail lines take up far less countryside than six-lane highways. Transporting goods too can be streamlined, with local depots handling the shorter distribution distances required while reducing the number of lorries on our roads 每 which might be better served by a nationalised postal service than fragmented companies competing unnecessarily: prices never seem to fall as a result of so-called competition.But on one point I can agree with Mr?Monbiot: we are unlikely to see an ambitious plan for national infrastructure planning from governments focussing only on five-year election cycles. I read with interest a recent  (31 July), who insisted that electric cars were shifting pollution from the car tailpipe to power stations. First, as an investor in energy, I would kindly point out that the efficiency of converting energy from one big engine, versus 1,000,000 small engines, is significantly different due to economies of scale.Second, the shift assumes that electric grids will continue to cater to peak demand. Currently, we are unable to store energy once it is generated from power stations 每 fossil fuel or renewable alike. But electric grids will in the next three to five years start to cater towards average demand, because of the innovation in energy storage. The exciting prospect is a 24/7 renewable electric grid, which energy storage makes possible. You get the efficiency of a grid system and the cleanness of renewables in one, and cheaply. A specific type of storage 每 liquid metal batteries 每 offers the greatest chance of commercial success, not least due to the short lifespan and dangers of lithium batteries.The greatest impediments to this are no longer scientific or commercial but political. UK government employees, not your typical risk takers by virtue of their employer, risk credibility when presenting innovation 每 concerning, when 42% of UK GDP is decided by government spending. Given the choice between making a comparatively risk-free decision over , and the decision to deploy new technology, which would you choose?Of course, the answer is to build both and then gradually shift to renewable energy, but the speed of this graduation, decided by how much risk the mandarins are willing to take, is what will determine whether we shift pollution from tailpipes to power stations.  With almost 30% of lorries on our roads totally empty and average HGV loading only around 50%, sorting out freight transport can be part of the road transport solution. In order to get better efficiency from HGVs, instead of the current old-fashioned time-based system which neither measures the actual miles driven nor the full economic, safety and environmental impact of the HGV traffic, the government should introduce a distance-based lorry charging system. This measure could incentivise better utilisation of lorries, thus reducing lorry miles, crashes and pollution. Furthermore, it would also make it easier for rail freight, the safer, sustainable alternative, which reduces road congestion, to compete; one large freight train can remove up to 136 HGVs. During weekdays unused cars line suburban streets. At weekends they choke town centres. Cars have become a status symbol rather than a sometime convenience. Many citizens are duped into undertaking the huge often unnecessary expense involved in car ownership even when adequate public transport is readily available. Often car ownership with the concomitant abuse of energy and resources would properly be a cause of shame rather than pride. As George Monbiot says, it is time to put the focus on cycling. This means designing our town centres to discourage cars and support bikes. It means park-and-ride schemes, frequent and flexible bus services, bike design for the elderly as well as the young, and pedestrianisation of town centres. Cars are expensive, polluting and dangerous, and dictate the design of towns to accommodate machines instead of people. Time to start designing our town centres for the benefit of citizens, not machines. The government is pressing ahead with its HS2 project at a cost of ?60bn to be completed in the early 2030s. At the same time it has just announced a policy of . Are there any projections available of the impact of this ban on traffic volumes? It seems likely that we will end up with a reduction in the number of vehicles on our roads, particularly motorways. As there are currently two motorways from London to Birmingham, why isn＊t one of these converted into the HS2 route? This would slash the project＊s costs and avoid some of the major environmental impacts of the current plan. While overhead electrification is expensive in both cost and time, why is consideration not given to the ※third rail§ electrification which powers most of the railways in the south-east plus the very reliable Mersey Rail trains around Liverpool. Installing a third rail can＊t be as expensive as building gantries and pylons. The rail industry needs to look at other alternatives, including having trains with the ability to obtain power from more than one source. ※Garden cities encouraged long journeys to work§ declares Simon Jenkins (, 3 August). That is the direct opposite of the truth. The central principle of the garden cities, and of their successors, the postwar new towns, was that there would be sufficient suitable employment for residents locally, so that they would not need to take long journeys to work. This was seen as an essential factor in allowing communal life to develop healthily.That eminently sensible principle has been largely eroded over the years by the dysfunctional way our national economy has proceeded, with the result that a far higher proportion of the people of such towns have been forced to spend much of their lives travelling long distances to work. But that should never be blamed on those who envisaged and developed these towns."																																																			
"Overseas tourists have begun to doubt the value of a trip to the ailing  and it is getting increasingly difficult to ※show people what they expect to see§, a dive operator has told a federal Senate inquiry.A Port Douglas operator, John Edmondson, said ※last-chance tourism§ was spurring on other visitors but there had been a ※weird§ lull in bookings this year after  made dead coral an unavoidable sight on reef visits.Edmondson told the environment and communications committee in Cairns on Tuesday that while experienced reef tourists still hailed the Great Barrier Reef as the world＊s best coral expanse, it was ※harder to get the coral and show people what they expect to see§.He said packages that cost the average family $800 for a day on the reef were becoming a harder sell, with ※forward bookings definitely softer this year§.This was despite a favourable exchange rate and security concerns in other countries with reef destinations, he told the committee, which is running .European reef visitors were routinely raising the issue of Australian government support for the Adani mine as a sign it was ※going in the wrong direction§ in its policy on climate change 每 the reef＊s greatest threat, Edmondson said.The Queensland Liberal National senator Ian Macdonald asked Edmondson, who studied marine biology, whether he believed ※like § it was the last chance to see the reef.※It＊s nearly the last chance,§ Edmondson said.While visitors to the reef were still deeply impressed, ※you＊re getting a creeping increase of people that had a great day 每 but you can see there was a lot of dead coral§, he said.Asked by Macdonald if he deliberately took tourists to ※dead coral places§, Edmondson said: ※You can＊t avoid dead coral.※I think what＊s happening now is some people think it＊s just not worth it because of what they＊ve seen and read, and that＊s offset by other people that know it＊s only going to get worse, and see it now.§Edmondson＊s business, Wavelength Reef Cruises, takes 22,000 people a year to see the reef, employs 20 people including marine biology graduates and takes $4.5m in revenue a year.It was ※a fantastic business at the moment§ but the ※very poor trajectory§ of the reef was a real concern and he had held back a $3m investment in a fourth boat, Edmondson said.※We＊ve postponed our decision because with the current situation you just don＊t want to be too exposed,§ he said.Macdonald questioned why tourists were linking Adani to the state of the reef, saying: ※I struggle to see the connection.§Edmondson said most travellers were ※fairly wealthy, they＊re mostly educated, they＊re aware of what＊s in the media§ and those with knowledge of coral reefs understood .They saw support for the Adani mine as counter to moves towards a lower carbon economy, he said.※If you come from the UK or France or Holland, windmills are a more common thing, renewable energy, much more electric cars 每 are we deserving of their money as custodians of the reef?§Edmondson told Macdonald that ※politically I＊m basically a Liberal voter who gets frustrated that, [on] the right wing of the centre right of politics, basically environmental issues are pushed over to the other side§. The broader public did not know what to believe about the reef amid ※sensationalist§ media coverage of the bleaching and responses from an industry that had left ※real gap in advocacy for the reef§ on climate change, he said.Tropical Tourism North  had sent an email urging its dive operator members by email to provide a ※tsunami§ of good news stories to counter bad publicity.※The reality is that there＊s been a very dramatic change and a shifting in baseline in a lot of areas,§ Edmondson said. ※You can still go out and have a fantastic day and the reef is still probably the best-managed reef in the world.※But it＊s an expensive day. It＊s $250 [a person] for most boats to go out to the reef and people have got a very high expectation.※To give them their value for money and give them a good product is getting harder and harder because it＊s harder to get the coral and show people what they expect to see.§"

Because Al Gore is to climate change＃ well, what Donald Trump is to climate change denial.It＊s 10 years since the reason for this, the documentary  was released into cinemas. It was an improbable project on almost every level: a film about what was then practically a non-subject, starring the man best known for not winning the 2000 US election, its beating heart and the engine of its narrative drive a PowerPoint presentation.When the filmmakers approached him, he explains to the room, ※I thought they were nuts. A movie of a slideshow, delivered by , what doesn＊t scream blockbuster about it?§ Except it was a blockbuster. In documentary terms, anyway. The careful accretion of facts and figures genuinely shocked people. And it＊s a measure of the impact it had, and still continues to have, that Gore delivers this vignette to a rapt crowd who, over the course of three days, are learning how to be ※Climate Reality Leaders§.It＊s the reason why we are all here 每 his foundation, the , an initiative that grew out of the film, provides intensive training in talking about climate change, combating climate change denial 每 and the tone might be described as ※activist upbeat§. This is a crisis that is solvable, we＊re told. Trump is just another hitch, another hurdle to overcome. And it will be overcome. Only occasionally does a sliver of despair leak around the edges. You have to stay positive, a man called David Ellenberger tells the audience. Though sometimes, he admits: ※There＊s not enough Prozac to get through the day.§It＊s almost a relief to hear someone acknowledge this. Because before there was ※FAKE NEWS!!!§ and the ※FAILING !§ Trump was tweeting about ※GLOBAL WARMING hoaxsters!§ and ※GLOBAL WARMING bullshit!§ The war on the mainstream media may capture the headlines currently, but the war on climate change science has been in play for years. And it＊s this that is one of the most fascinating aspects of Gore＊s new film, . Because if the US had a subtitle at the moment, it might be that, too, and the struggle to overcome fake facts and false narratives funded by corporate interests and politically motivated billionaires is one that Gore has been at the frontline of for more than a decade.The film runs through a host of facts 每 that 14 of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001 is just one.

In recent weeks, the  has started describing the Trump administration as waging a ※§, a full-on assault against evidence-based science that runs in parallel with his attacks on evidence-based reporting.

They are all pieces of the same puzzle; a puzzle that Gore has been tracking for years, because it turns out that climate change denial was the canary in the coal mine.※In order to fix the climate crisis, we need to first fix the government crisis,§ he says. ※Big money has so much influence now.§ And he says a phrase that is as dramatic as it is multilayered: ※Our democracy has been hacked.§ It＊s something I hear him repeat 每 to the audience in the ballroom, in a room backstage, a few weeks later in London, and finally on the phone earlier this month.What do you mean by it exactly? ※I mean that those with access to large amounts of money and raw power,§ says Gore, ※have been able to subvert all reason and fact in collective decision making. The  are the largest funders of climate change denial. And  claims it has stopped, but it really hasn＊t. It has given a quarter of a billion dollars in donations to climate denial groups. It＊s clear they are trying to cripple our ability to respond to this existential threat.§One of Trump＊s first acts after his inauguration was to remove all mentions of climate change from federal websites. More overlooked is that one of Theresa May＊s first actions on becoming prime minister 每 within 24 hours of taking office 每 was to close the ; subsequently donations from oil and gas companies to the Conservative party continued to roll in. And what is increasingly apparent is that the same think tanks that operate in the States are also at work in Britain, and climate change denial operates as a bridgehead: uniting the right and providing an entry route for other tenets of  belief. And, it＊s this network of power that Gore has had to try to understand, in order to find a way to combat it.※In Tennessee we have an expression: ＆If you see a turtle on top of a fence post, you can be pretty sure it didn＊t get there by itself.＊ And if you see these levels of climate denial, you can be pretty sure it didn＊t just spread itself. The large carbon polluters have spent between $1bn and $2bn spreading false doubt. Do you know the book, ? It documents how the tobacco industry discredited the consensus on cigarette smoking and cancer by creating doubt, and shows how it＊s linked to the climate denial movement. They hired many of the same PR firms and some of the same think tanks. And, in fact, some of those who work on climate change denial actually still dispute the links between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.§The big change between our first conversation in Denver and our last, on the phone this month, is the news that Gore had been desperately hoping wouldn＊t happen: Trump＊s  on 1 June that he was pulling America out of the Paris Agreement. The negotiations in Paris are right at the heart of the new film, its emotional centre, and when I watch it in March, the ending still sees Gore expressing guarded optimism.So, what happened? ※I was wrong,§ he says on the phone from Australia, where he＊s been promoting the film. ※Based on what he told me, I definitely thought there was a better than even chance he might choose to stay in. But I was wrong. I was fearful that other countries for whom it was a close call would follow his lead, but I＊m thrilled the reaction has been exactly the opposite. The other 19 members of the G20 have reiterated that Paris is irreversible. And governors and mayors all over the country have been saying we are all still in and, in fact, it＊s just going to make us redouble our commitments.§The film had to be recut, the ending changed, the gloves are now off. What changed Trump＊s mind? ※I think  and his crowd put a big push on Trump and convinced him that he needed to give this to his base supporters. He had blood in his eyes.§ It＊s instructive because Bannon, Trump＊s chief strategist, is also the ideologue behind Trump＊s assault on the media. And Bannon＊s understanding of the news and information space, and efforts to manipulate it via  News and , both funded by another key climate change denier, , are at the heart of the Trump agenda.And what becomes clear if you Google ※climate change§ is how effective the right has been in owning the subject. YouTube＊s results are dominated by nothing but climate change denial videos. This isn＊t news for Gore. He has multiple high-level links to Silicon Valley. He＊s on the board of Apple and used to be an adviser for Google. ※We are fully aware of the problem,§ he says with what sounds like resigned understatement. Gore has had more than a decade fighting climate change denial, and in some respects, the problem has simply worsened and deepened.※On the other hand, two-thirds of the American people are convinced that it＊s an extremely serious crisis and we have to take it on,§ he says. ※And there is a law of physics that every action produces an equal and opposite reaction. And I do think there is a reaction to the Trump/Brexit/Alt-Right populist authoritarianism around the world. People who took liberal democracy more or less for granted are now awakening to a sense that it can only be defended by the people themselves.§And it＊s in this, his belief in social progress against all odds, that he takes his lead from the civil rights movement. The cut of the film I see compares the climate change movement to the other great social movements that eventually won out: the abolition of slavery, women＊s suffrage, civil rights. Something profound and disturbing is happening right now, though, he admits. ※The information system is in such a chaotic transition and people are deluged with so much noise that it gives an opening for Trump and his forces to wage war against facts and reason.§Is it, as some people describe, an information war? ※Absolutely,§ he says. ※There＊s no question about it.§What there isn＊t much of, in the film, is Al Gore, the man. In 2010, he split from Tipper, his wife of 40 years and the mother of his two grown-up daughters, and what becomes clear is just how much of his life the fight takes up. When I catch up with him next, he＊s in London for a board meeting of his green-focused investment firm, , and I ask him to tell me about his recent travels.※Two weeks ago, I had three red-eyes in five days. I＊ve been in Sweden, the Netherlands, Sharjah, then let＊s see, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles. Where else?§ he asks his assistant.※Vegas,§ she says. ※We did .§※Vegas, we did that. And then, let＊s see, Nashville, on my farm.§I assume this amount of travel is connected to the release of the film, but no. ※I＊ve been at this level for the past 10 years and longer.§ He hesitates to use the word ※mission§, he says, and then uses it. ※When you feel a sense of purpose that seems to justify pouring everything you can into it, it makes it easier to get up in the morning.§He does tell me a bit about his parents though. He describes his father, Al Gore Sr, who grew up poor then became a lawyer and a politician, as ※a hero to me§. And it was at the family farm in Carthage, Tennessee, that he held the first Climate Reality training, an informal get-together of 50 people that has morphed into the event I witnessed in Denver. There＊s no ※type§ or demographic, I shared a table with a disparate group 每 including a consultant for the aerospace industry, a French lawyer and an American chef. And they seemed to have almost nothing in common aside from their passion to do something about climate change. ※I＊m a gardener so I＊m seeing what＊s happening with my own eyes,§ the chef, Susan Kutner, told me. ※You can＊t ignore it.§In light of Trump＊s fixation with fake news, it＊s fascinating to see. Gore has been fighting disinformation for more than a decade. And, he＊s developed his training programme counter to the prevailing ideology. The answer is not online. Social media will not save us. We will not click climate change away. The answer he＊s come up with is low-tech, old-fashioned, human. He takes the time to talk to people directly, one to one, in the hope they will speak to other people 每 who will speak to other people.The course is run by Gore. He is on stage almost the entire time over three intensive days. And the heart of it is still the slideshow. One of his aides tells me how he was up until 2am the night before. ※He＊s obsessed with his slides, he has 30,000 of them and he switches them around all the time.§In the film, you see him perpetually hustling, calling world leaders, rounding up solar energy entrepreneurs, training activists. Hearing information from ※people you know§ is at the heart of his strategy. ※You need people who will look you in the eye and say: ＆Look, this is what I＊ve learned, this is what you need to know.＊ It works. I＊ve seen it work. It is working. And it＊s just getting started. We＊ve got 12,000 trained leaders now.§How many people do you think it＊s impacted?※Millions. Honestly, millions. And a non- trivial percentage of them have gone on to become ministers in their countries＊ governments or take leadership roles in international organisations. They＊ve had an outsized impact.  [the UN climate chief], who ran the Paris meeting, she was in the second training session I did in Tennessee. And, right now, people are getting really fired up.§Al Gore shared the  in 2007 for his efforts in combating climate change, but in some ways it feels like he＊s just getting started. The rest of the world is only now cottoning on to the enlightenment struggle that＊s at the heart of it 每 a battle royal to defend facts and reason against people and forces for whom it＊s a truth too inconvenient to allow. For Gore, the US oil companies are the ultimate culprits, but it＊s only just becoming apparent that Russia has also played a role, amplifying messages around climate change as it did around the other issues at the heart of Trump＊s agenda, and we segue into his visits to Russia in the early 90s, during one of which he met Putin for the first time.What did you make of him? ※I would not have thought of him as the future president of Russia. I once did a televised town hall event to the whole of Russia and Putin was the one who was in charge of making sure all the cables were connected and whatnot.§What does he make of the investigations into Russian interference? ※I think the investigation of the Trump campaign＊s collusions with the Russians and the existence of financial levers of Putin over Trump is proceeding with its own rhythm beneath the news cycle, and may well strike pay dirt.§ It＊s also worth pointing out that when someone passed his campaign stolen information about ＊s debate research, he handed it to the FBI.And then he amazes me by pulling out a reference to an  I conducted with , the Bristol businessman who funded Nigel Farage＊s Leave campaign. He＊s been reading up about the links between Brexit and Trump, and Banks＊s and Farage＊s support of Putin and Russia. ※He told you: ＆Russia needs a strong man,＊ didn＊t he? And you hear that in the US, and I don＊t think it＊s fair to the Russians. I am a true believer in the superiority of representative democracy where there is a healthy ecosystem characterised by free speech and an informed citizenry. I really resist the slur against any nation that they＊re incapable of governing themselves.§Brexit, Trump, climate change, oil producers, dark money, Russian influence, a full- frontal assault on facts, evidence, journalism, science, it＊s all connected.

"nly 20 years ago, it would have sounded like the stuff of fantasy: a clean, green image of the 21st century, with Britons gliding along in electrified, no doubt self-driving, cars. Even now, the pledge to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040 has a bold, vaguely futuristic ring to it. That?is its political genius. In fact, it reflects the current trajectory of the motor industry 每 while masterfully distracting us from the government＊s persistent failure in the rest of?its plan to address the health crisis that must be tackled now: the air pollution that chokes our cities.The announcement may help to concentrate the minds of policymakers, consumers and car manufacturers on the need to press ahead with the switch and the huge changes that will be required. (Installing ranks of charging points is the least of it; how will Britain supply them all with power?) But the government has already said that 2050 emissions targets will require ※almost all new cars and vans sold to be near-zero emission at the tailpipe by 2040§. Norway is to ban the sale of all fossil-fuel-dependent cars by 2025. Momentum in electric purchases is building rapidly, thanks to falling costs, longer battery ranges and more charging points, even if the total number of sales remains relatively low; at present just 1 in 700 of the cars on Britain＊s roads are pure electric. Volvo has said . If anything, the need is for governments to  so more people start choosing electric or hybrid vehicles now. Twenty-three years is too long to wait.Tens of thousands of people die prematurely each year because of air pollution, and many more experience related health problems. But the government has dragged its feet throughout. First, it failed to meet the legally binding European targets on nitrogen dioxide emissions. Then, it twice failed to produce an adequate plan to address these. Next, it claimed that it could not publish its updated plan because it would breach ※purdah§ during the election campaign (an assertion the high court rightly rubbished).Now it publishes these wholly inadequate and downright cynical proposals. It has admitted that introducing charges for vehicles to enter clean air zones would be the quickest and most cost-effective way of?lowering nitrogen dioxide levels on most urban roads to acceptable rates. But its plan tries to dodge a backlash from motorists by putting the burden of such measures on local authorities 每 and urging that charges be used only as a last resort.There are some good elements within this plan. Money to retrofit buses, HGVs and black cabs, and a bigger tranche to promote walking and cycling, will be money well spent 每 though the funding had been announced already. Extra cash to help councils curb diesel emissions is welcome, albeit insufficient at ?255m. But at this rate any progress will be made at the pace of a Sinclair C5 rather than a top-of-the-range Tesla.Last week, Michael Gove offered : ※We have an opportunity, outside the EU, to design potentially more effective, more rigorous and more responsive institutions, new means of holding individuals and organisations to account for environmental outcomes,§ the environment secretary insisted. But the late, inadequate and lamentable response to air pollution shows that this is about as likely to?materialise as the ?350m a week promised to the NHS on the side of a (conventionally fuelled) bus. The government has had to be forced into taking action, and it is taking the bare minimum it can. Imagine what it will do?without EU scrutiny.There is no need to design alternatives to the government＊s plan in this case. Campaigners have put them forward already. Clean air zones may not sound as flashy or exciting as the distant vision Mr Gove has expertly promoted, but they would mean purer air and healthier residents 每 not in 23 years＊ time, but now."																																																			
" campaign to plant enough trees to offset Donald Trump＊s climate policies is under way. Organisers hope to plant 10bn trees by 24 December 2017, with the last one being a Christmas tree planted in front of the White House.The organisers of Trump Forest are asking people to donate trees to make up for the 650m tonnes of CO2 that will be released into the atmosphere by 2025 if the president＊s plans to backtrack on US climate commitments go ahead. ※Since Trump has taken office, we have seen him make attack after attack on initiatives designed to slow down manmade climate change. Trump has declared a war on a healthy climate for life on Earth so we are fighting back with an army of trees. The more trees that people put in the ground, and the quicker they do it, the faster we will offset Trump＊s ignorance,§ says glaciologist Daniel Price, a co-founder of the project.The figure of 650m tonnes 每 equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of 33 million Americans 每 is calculated from Trump＊s decision to rollback the  pledge to lower emissions by at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025. The Obama administration＊s clean power plan, , aimed to cut emissions from existing coal and gas-fired power plants and would have reduced carbon emissions by nearly 650m tonnes by 2025 每 just under halfway to meeting the Paris pledge.Jeremy Woods, deputy director of environmental policy at Imperial College London, says the project＊s calculations make sense, even if they are at the optimistic end of the scale. He says that trees 每 especially when they are growing as they use more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 每 are a key component of removing CO2 from the air, and an important tool towards a sustainable climate future.※Overall, it＊s a positive project. If you plant trees on one hectare of land, roughly the area of a football pitch, with one tree every 10 square metres, that＊s 1,000 trees per hectare. With 100 ha per square kilometre, the 100,000 sq kms targeted by Trump Forest would plant 10m hectares with 10bn trees.※I would expect that many trees to take at least 300m tonnes of CO2 out of the air over the eight-year period, so 650m tonnes by 2025 is not outrageous if you take into account the growth of the trees is likely to be higher than my conservative assumptions used here. ※Projects like this demonstrate the importance of doing something now even if they can come across as glib,§ says Woods.So far, the tree count stands at 342,000, from 1,242 donors who have invested ?39,000 ($50,000). If the campaign is to succeed, they must plant enough trees to fill at least 104,659 sq km, the same size as the US state of Kentucky. (France is 643,801 sq km, England is 130,279 sq km and Ireland 84,421 sq km.) Despite the massive scale of planting needed, the campaigners believe it can be done.※It＊s clearly a big challenge, but only recently the world record was broken when India put  in the ground in a day. If we all chip in, it is a completely realistic goal,§ says Price.※In 30 years from now, when people look back on the Trump presidency as an attack on the planet and on rational thought, it would be pretty cool if the history books say his actions were negligible because the global community offset the administration＊s additional emissions.§Woods is positive, but cautious. He says that reforestation initiatives are complicated to implement, and that it is difficult to make sure they are sustainably introduced into local communities. ※On balance, it＊s a positive thing if it＊s done well ... but we also need to remember that tree planting takes time and investment and so not all, in fact, very few, of the 10bn trees are likely to be planted within the next 5 years. The new forest has to be there in perpetuity if the carbon is to be kept out of the atmosphere. And you need to help food production and local communities.※My fear is that people may look at it and say this isn＊t that big an area ＃ all we have to do is plant trees on an area the size of Kentucky and the problem is solved, but it＊s nothing like that. There＊s no silver bullet,§ he says.People can contribute in two ways to Trump Forest: either by buying trees from their preferred tree-planting organisation anywhere in the world and sending Trump Forest the receipt so they can count their pledge, or by donating directly to their partner, the Eden Reforestation Projects. Donating through the , $1 buys eight mangrove trees in Madagascar (they are hoping to have the credit card fee removed soon so $1 will buy 10 mangrove trees). The organisers say they have tapped into a global sense of frustration with the president＊s climate change policies. The project＊s co-founder Adrien Taylor says he felt helpless and had to do something to compensate for Trump＊s behaviour. ※Only a small percentage of the world＊s population voted in Trump, but everyone, everywhere, pays the cost of his climate ignorance. He should be standing up and taking leadership in addressing what is the biggest collective challenge humanity has ever faced. But he＊s not,§ says Taylor.※People like Trump are spineless dinosaurs who have no place in politics in this century.§ "																																																			
"oday＊s air pollution announcement from the Tories is the latest in a string of green-sounding policies from a government that had previously gone quiet on the environment. Sadly, like so many of their plans, scratch beneath the surface and the green all but disappears.The ban on new diesel and petrol cars by 2040 is a step forward, but it really is a tiny one. By then  because of air pollution, after years of delay from the government on the issue. David Powell, of the New Economic Foundation, says it＊s like ※telling a bullied 10-year-old that you＊ll definitely have given the bully detention by the time he＊s 33§. The truth is that the government is actually behind the curve, with firms like Volvo saying that all of its new motors will be electric or hybrid after 2019. But the ban wouldn＊t be enough, even if it were happening sooner. The government is still woefully unambitious in its plans to clean up our filthy air and combat climate change emissions from transport.Rather than simply looking for one headline-grabbing policy, the government should be embarking on a paradigm shift when it comes to how we get about in this country. Current spending plans will see ?23bn of taxpayers＊ money ploughed into the road network 每 thus encouraging more private car use, often at the expense of our precious countryside. Just last week ministers said they will  on our railways. And while electric cars will have a positive effect on reducing some of the most toxic fumes in our air, they won＊t solve the congestion problems afflicting many of our cities. Crucially, electric vehicles are only as clean as their power supply 每 and we currently face the prospect of driving cars powered by fracked gas.Of course it＊s not just cars that contribute to air pollution. Fumes from airports are deadly too 每 yet the government and opposition alike are apparently hell-bent on expanding Heathrow and exploring airport expansion projects elsewhere too. The residents of Newham, east London, may breathe a little easier because of the diesel and petrol ban, but the effects of an expanded bankers＊ airport in the Docklands will run counter to such improvements.To get a real sense of the transport priorities of recent governments it＊s worth considering how the cost of getting around has changed. While the , train fares are up 23%, and coaches and buses up 33%. Shockingly, the real cost of domestic flights dropped 16% between 2010 and 2015 too. Combine these price increases with busy streets where people fear walking and cycling and you can see why so many people still opt to get in their car even for short distances, and why so many people use domestic flights to get around our small country.It＊s down to the government to help people switch to cleaner, cheaper and more sustainable modes of transport. For a start that must mean an end to the continuing freeze on fuel duty 每 and a commitment to investing the money raised (estimated to be worth about ) into public transport, walking and cycling. We should also investigate how a diesel scrappage scheme could hand people public transport vouchers, rather than always offering like-for-like replacement (though of course for some people that will be needed too).Other countries are leading the way. In Amsterdam and the Hague up to . In  has been a huge success. Trains are  than they are here.Ultimately we need a green transport revolution, not another tinker with a transport system that＊s creaking. Let＊s aim for towns and cities that are easily navigable by foot and bike, a fully electric and publicly owned train system that covers the country, and local public transport that＊s a joy to use 每 rather than the overpriced, unreliable service that＊s currently on offer in so many places.Building a transport system fit for the future won＊t just save lives that are cut short by air pollution, it will change the way we live for the better. Well-designed transport means strong local communities, safer streets for our children to play in and quicker commutes that free up time for us to do the things we love. A diesel ban is a small part of designing such a system. It＊s now time to put the rest of the jigsaw pieces in place."																																																			
"Diesel vehicles will disappear from roads much faster than expected, according to the European Union＊s industry commissioner.El?bieta Bie里kowska spoke after the European parliament backed tougher rules to prevent manufacturers selling cars that produce far more toxic pollution when driven than in official tests. The ※dieselgate§ scandal began when  in the US but it is now clear that  than regulators intended. The scandal highlighted the EU＊s lax vehicle regulations and on Tuesday the European parliament voted strongly in favour of a bill that would bolster EU oversight and allow Brussels to fine carmakers up to 30,000 (?26,000) per vehicle.The new measures will eventually take diesel cars off the roads, Bienkowska said: ※Diesel will not disappear from one day to another. But I am quite sure they will disappear much faster than we can imagine.§ The mayors of Paris, Madrid and Athens have already signalled a .Also on Tuesday, the  to charge polluting vehicles for entering the UK＊s capital and the national government may announce similar measures across the country in the coming weeks. ※Frankly, we don＊t trust the manufacturers,§ Sadiq Khan said.Under the EU measures backed on Tuesday, carmakers would no longer directly pay testing agencies for pollution measurements in a bid to break their cosy relationships. EU nations now have to fund car exhaust testing centres, although they may levy fees from car makers to do so. Brussels would also get powers to carry out vehicle spot-checks and levy fines, while national authorities would be able to peer-review each other＊s decisions. The law still needs to be finalised in negotiations between EU lawmakers, the European commission and member states. However, the new measures stopped short of creating an independent EU-wide surveillance agency to monitor vehicle emissions, which was one of the key recommendations of a parliamentary report into the dieselgate scandal. National agencies were seen as too vulnerable to lobbying by powerful motor companies in the same country and the report accused EU legislators and governments of caving in to lobbying from the motor industry.Keith Taylor, Green party MEP for the south-east of England and a member of the European parliament＊s environment and transport committees, said: ※UK Conservative MEPs were the biggest opponents of the dieselgate report and were responsible for watering down its findings, which excoriate their friends in the car industry.§Julia Poliscanova, at the NGO Transport & Environment, said: ※It is disappointing that MEPs have rejected the opportunity to make dieselgate history by establishing an independent agency. Nevertheless the parliament has strengthened the new powers for the European commission to spot check cars on the road and properly scrutinise national regulators. Overall this is a good package in response to the dieselgate scandal that has poisoned the air we all breathe.§Corporate  Observatory＊s campaigner Fabian H邦bner said: ※The car industry should never have had such a big leverage over emissions regulation. It＊s a scandal for how long it has been the puppet master of commission and member states.§"																																																			
"As humans put ever more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, the Earth heats up. These are the basics of global warming. But where does the heat go? How much extra heat is there? And how accurate are our measurements? These are questions that climate scientists ask. If we can answer these questions, it will better help us prepare for a future with a very different climate. It will also better help us predict what that future climate will be.The most important measurement of global warming is . In fact, ※global warming§ is really ※ocean warming.§ If you are going to measure the changing climate of the oceans, you need to have many sensors spread out across the globe that take measurements from the ocean surface to the very depths of the waters. Importantly, you need to have measurements that span decades so a long-term trend can be established. These difficulties are tackled by oceanographers, and a significant advancement was presented in  in the journal Climate Dynamics. That paper, which I was fortunate to be involved with, looked at three different ocean temperature measurements made by three different groups. We found that regardless of whose data was used or where the data was gathered, the oceans are warming.In the paper, we describe perhaps the three most important factors that affect ocean-temperature accuracy. First, sensors can have biases (they can be ※hot§ or ※cold§), and these biases can change over time. An example of biases was identified in the 1940s. Then, many ocean temperature measurements were made using buckets that gathered water from ships. Sensors put into the buckets would give the water temperature. Then, a new temperature sensing approach started to come online where temperatures were measured using ship hull-based sensors at engine intake ports. It turns out that bucket measurements are slightly cooler than measurements made using hull sensors, which are closer to the engine of the ship.During World War II, the British Navy cut back on its measurements (using buckets) and the US Navy expanded its measurements (using hull sensors); consequently, a sharp warming in oceans was seen in the data. But this warming was an artifact of the change from buckets to hull sensors. After the war, when the British fleet re-expanded its bucket measurements, the ocean temperatures seemed to fall a bit. Again, this was an artifact from the data collection. Other such biases and artifacts arose throughout the years as oceanographers have updated measurement equipment. If you want the true rate of ocean temperature change, you have to remove these biases.Another source of uncertainty is related to the fact that we just don＊t have sensors at all ocean locations and at all times. Some sensors, which are dropped from cargo ships, are densely located along major shipping routes. Other sensors, dropped from research vessels, are also confined to specific locations across the globe. Currently, we are heavily using the ARGO fleet, which contains approximately 3800 autonomous devices spread out more or less uniformly across the ocean, but these only entered service in 2005. Prior to that, temperatures measurements were not uniform in the oceans. As a consequence, scientists have to use what is called a ※mapping§ procedure to interpolate temperatures between temperature measurements. Sort of like filling in the gaps where no data exist. The mapping strategy used by scientists can affect the ocean temperature measurements.Finally, temperatures are usually referenced to a baseline ※climatology.§ So, when we say temperatures have increased by 1 degree, it is important to say what the baseline climatology is. Have temperatures increased by 1 degree since the year 1990? Since the year 1970? Since 1900? The choice of baseline climatology really matters.In the study, we looked at the different ways that three groups make decisions about mapping, bias, and climatology. We not only asked how much the oceans are warming, but how the warming differs for various areas (ocean basins) and various depths. We found that each ocean basin has warmed significantly. Despite this fact, there are some differences amongst the three groups. For instance, in the 300-700 meter oceans depths in the Pacific and Southern oceans, significant differences are exhibited amongst the tree groups. That said, the central fact is that regardless of how you measure, who does the measurements, when or where the measurements are taken, we are warming.The lead author, Dr. Gonjgie Wang described the importance of the study this way:In plain English, it will be important that we keep high-quality temperature sensors positioned throughout the oceans so in the future we will be able to predict where our climate is headed. We say in science that a measurement not made is a measurement lost forever. And there are no more important measurements than of heating of the oceans."																																																			
"It hit me like a smack in the face. This year＊s  was quite blatant in showcasing the effects of climate change; you may not have noticed though. Most people visiting the show or tuning into the BBC coverage were homed in on the increasingly more naturalistic planting style, the reduced number of large show gardens and the amazing lupins. However, the increasing temperatures that our planet is experiencing are catching up with us gardeners. While the changes may be subtle in our own gardens, when you see them distilled and condensed, as I did at the world＊s greatest flower show, the dawning realisation that they are real comes as quite a shock. The first thing I noticed on entering the show was just how hot it was. It was a pleasure to walk around the show gardens on such a lovely sunny day, but in the back of my mind I had the realisation that the heat was part of an extended period of drought that the southeast, and the UK more generally, had been suffering. On talking to the gardeners and designers I heard many an exclamation of ※I can＊t wait for it to rain§. After such a very warm, wet winter in 2016 and then this, the driest winter for 20 years, I wondered if these unpredictable weather events are what we should come to expect in future? Almost the first show garden I clapped eyes on rammed the point home a little further.  was an absolute triumph in my eyes. It transported me directly to the lime stone quarries of the Mediterranean and fitted so beautifully with the sun＊s heat. I wanted to clamber into it and botanise between the columns of limestone. I could see plants of one of my favourites from the region, white henbane (, winking at me with its black eye from among the rocks and prickly goldenfleece (shining at me, reflecting the yellow sun above. While revelling in such delicate and beautiful planting, I couldn＊t help but feel that this was what the southeast of the UK may have to count as normal in future years. We may have to accept some of these Mediterranean species as the newcomers in place of the hedgerow plants and garden weeds that we feel so comfortable with. The next port of call was with my friend  on her ; an exquisite recreation of the boreal forests of Canada. With little leeway on the accuracy of the species used in the garden there were, again, plants here that piqued my interest. Sweet fern ( jumped out at me from the corner of the plot, and labrador tea ( had a presence only felt once you knew it was there.  These two gardens felt like the antithesis of one another, yet the plants within them are so bound to this changing climate that they shared something deeper. The boreal forests of Canada, you see, are expected to warm at above the global average, and the species within them will be unable to keep up. The coniferous trees are burning more frequently than their ecology can handle and, if not burning, then being pushed north by drought stress and competition from the more rugged deciduous species that will take their place. Who knows how long comptonia has left on the planet it has called home for more than 60 million years?These two gardens took my mind to the effects on the earth＊s natural landscape but the next, ＊s Inland Homes garden, , made me think of the impact a changing climate is having on the UK＊s gardens. When asked if I thought that plants such as agaves and aloes would be hardy in a British garden, my answer, after a momentary pause, was an emphatic ※yes§.I had seen plants of , the dragon tree, growing outside just the day before at the , and just a month earlier I had visited a garden in Kent where the traditional rockery plants were being ousted by agaves and other succulents, alongside Mediterranean climate species from all around the world. For the first time, maybe also because of the sun, the vibrant colours of Malde＊s garden looked right beneath a very British sky.A colour I fear may be heading for a fall in the gardens of our little island is the clear blue of Himalayan poppies (Meconopsis). Chris Beardshaw had planted them along-side similarly cool loving giant Himalayan lilies () in his . They were on show in the Great Pavillion too, most notably on the display by that most wonderful of Scottish nurseries, . I am afraid that, as warmer, drier climes push north, Scotland, and maybe some of the cooler parts of the Lake District will become the last refuge for this much-loved member of our garden flora.For me, the South Africans dominated the great pavilion again. Tall grasses such as restios played foil to proteas, agapanthus, kniphofias and the brightly coloured southern heaths. Pelargoniums, another of South Africa＊s inexhaustible contribution to our gardens, were on show in all their finery too; both the interesting species and a plethora of cultivars. I often see red pelargoniums, left in an unattended window box, doing well after a mild winter, and my own v. is left in a sheltered spot year-round. I wonder, in the future, will this be the standard rather than the exception to the rule? Certainly, South Africa will have more to offer British gardeners as time goes on. The  still leads when it comes to gardening fashion, but I think the trend we all need to be looking to for the future of Britain＊s gardens will be lead by our changing climate. We need to be brave in our gardens, especially given the unpredictability of the issue in hand. It＊s an envelope I feel needs to be pushed, and I intend to be there at the front of this charge."

"Australia＊s chief scientist says a new clean energy target will deliver lower power prices to consumers than the status quo, but his report also models a scheme with a low target for emissions reduction from the electricity sector.In his much anticipated review of the national electricity market, Alan Finkel has examined a scheme with an emissions reduction target of 28% on 2005 levels by 2030, rather than the reductions of 60% that some experts say would be necessary for Australia to meet its whole-of-economy pollution reduction target under the Paris climate accord.Finkel＊s report, given to the Turnbull government and the premiers on Friday, says the clean energy target (CET) modelled by the review would result in lower residential and industrial electricity prices than leaving policy settings unchanged.It says the CET scenario is more favourable to the hip pocket than an emissions intensity trading scheme 每 a form of carbon trading supported by a range of experts and industry stakeholders 每 but the CET would see more electricity produced by brown coal※because there is no penalty for high emissions generators§.The report also warns governments that setting a higher target for electricity than a 28% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 trajectory ※may have consequences for security, cost and reliability§.The proposed CET would replace the existing renewable energy target in 2020. Modelling undertaken for the review estimates that by 2030, 42% of electricity demand will be met by renewable generation., the Finkel report recommends that power generators face new security and reliability obligations, and it says ageing power plants should provide energy regulators with three years＊ notice before they close.Finkel says all new generators intending to connect to the national electricity market must meet technical requirements to contribute to fast frequency response and system strength.He says the new rules would require minimum levels of inertia in each region. ※This will make the system better able to withstand disruptions like generator outages or interconnector failures,§ the report says.In addition to the notice before shutdown requirements, which are designed to stop a repeat of the , the report says the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) should also publish a register of expected closures to assist long-term investor planning.With a new CET encouraging gas fired power, Finkel recommends Aemo be given ※expanded visibility on gas contracts so that it can plan responses to shortages§.He also calls for an expansion of gas supply. ※Governments should also work with communities to encourage safe exploration and production, based on best available evidence, performance data and appropriate financial rights for landholders§.Ahead of the release of the report, the deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce said he would be happy to accept a new CET provided it allowed for the construction of new coal-fired power stations.Joyce said if Australia walked away from coal exports and coal-fired power generation people would need to be ※prepared to be poorer§.The former prime minister Tony Abbott  it would be a ※big mistake§ for the government to adopt an emissions target that knocked out new high-efficiency coal-fired power stations.While Labor has been signalling it will bring an open mind to the review, the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said ※you can＊t have a clean energy target that defines clean energy to include coal-fired power§.※Barnaby Joyce was out this morning saying that a clean energy target must accommodate the building of new coal-fired power stations. A CET that accommodates new coal-fired power stations is an oxymoron; it is a contradiction in terms§.Speaking to reporters at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in Hobart, the prime minister, , said there was ※no barrier to building a coal-fired power station§ in the system envisaged by Finkel.※There is nothing in the clean energy target that would prevent a new coal-fired power station being built,§ the prime minister said.Challenged on whether a coal fired power station would be built in the absence of substantial government subsidy, Turnbull said: ※Thank you for your opinion on that but others would differ. Time will tell§.Turnbull said a CET had a number of ※very strong virtues.§ He said the system was technology neutral and administratively familiar. ※It would follow on from the renewable energy target and business is used to it§.The Greens climate and energy spokesman Adam Bandt said the new arrangements proposed by Finkel were weaker than the system proposed by John Howard in 2007.※The Finkel report is full of good ideas, but the key proposal of a CET is far worse than the version John Howard announced in 2007 and will see consumers subsidise gas and let coal keep polluting,§ Bandt said.※Bill Shorten and Labor cannot end the climate wars by running up the white flag and blindly signing up to a deal with the Liberals.§Finkel told reporters after Friday＊s Coag meeting in the system he was proposing, there was ※no prohibition of any kind that prevents that coal from being built.§The chief scientist said it was ※conceivable§ that new coal fired power stations could be built, and he said it was ※probably more likely that the existing coal stations will run longer than they would under a business as usual model§ because there was now a price signal to determine future investment decisions.He said his recommendations did not have an eye to political considerations. Finkel said he approached the task ※absolutely objectively§.Asked whether the 28% target was too low ball to meet Australia＊s Paris commitments, Finkel said his intention was to ensure ※the electricity sector does at least its fair share in meeting those international obligations§.He said it was up to the government to determine whether a 28% target was acceptable and it was beyond the scope of his terms of referene to determine how the economy wide emissions reductions should happen.※How those obligations are met across the whole of the economy is beyond the terms of reference,§ Finkel said.Asked whether the low target in the Finkel report meant that the government had now given up on meeting Australia＊s Paris commitments, the energy minister Josh Frydenberg said Australia had ※a very good record of meeting our international targets.§※Every sector has to do its bit, but I do point out that Dr Finkel in his report does issue a note of caution about adopting targets for the electricity sector beyond 28% because of the ramifications it would have for energy security and affordability,§ Frydenberg said.The Climate Institute＊s acting chief executive, Olivia Kember, said it was clear emissions reduction of 28% was too modest.※It＊s absolutely clear that aiming for 28% emissions reductions in electricity isn＊t enough,§ Kember said.※For a start, reducing emissions in electricity is much easier than reducing emissions from agriculture and parts of industry, so the smart way to meet a national emissions reduction target is to make deeper emissions cuts in the power sector so that those other sectors have a bit of room§. ※Secondly, under the Paris agreement which Australia signed up to along with 195 other countries, the long-term goal is to limit temperature rise to 1.5-2∼ celsius. That means net zero emissions by 2050, and so 28% by 2030 just doesn＊t take us far enough along the path to net zero§.The review examined the relative market share of technologies under a business as usual case and a CET system.By 2030, if policies remained as they currently are, 14% of generation would come from wind, 8% from hydro, 3% from large scale solar, 1% from biomass, and 9% from rooftop solar. would make up 57% and gas 8%. Large scale intermittent generation 每 from wind power and large scale solar 每 would be 17%.By 2030, under a CET, the relative mix would see 18% of generation from wind, 8% from hydro, 6% from large scale solar, 1% from biomass, and 9% rooftop solar.Coal would drop to 53% and gas to 5%. Large scale intermittent generation would be 24% of the market."																																																			
"The embattled Commonwealth Bank is being sued by shareholders for what they say is a failure to properly disclose the risks to the business posed by climate change.The case will be the first anywhere in the world to test in court how companies are required to disclose climate change-related risks in their annual reports, and follows calls by shareholders, regulators and central banks around the world for greater clarity., after which the federal court will decide how the case should proceed.The claim, brought by lawyers at Environmental Justice Australia on behalf of Commonwealth Bank shareholders Guy and Kim Abrahams, says the bank＊s 2016 directors＊ report did not adequately inform investors of climate change risks.It also seeks an injunction to stop the bank making the same omissions in future annual reports.The move comes six months after the Australian financial regulator , and called for companies to report on climate change-related risks as financial risks.The sorts of risks the Commonwealth Bank might face as a result of climate change are diverse, said David Barnden, a lawyer at Environmental Justice Australia.※CBA has exposure to the Australian economy in general. We could be talking about anything from extractive projects to the housing market, which might face risks from sea level rise,§ Barnden said.Reputational risks for the bank as the economy moves away from fossil fuels could also be significant, Barnden said, with the shareholders raising concerns about the bank＊s position on funding Adani＊s proposed Carmichael coalmine and associated infrastructure.※There is an aspect of the claim that looks at the reputational and financial risks the Carmichael mine might pose to the bank,§ Barnden said. ※We say that CBA ought to have known of those risks and should tell investors what its plans are with respect to the mine and if it is considering financially supporting the mine.§Another part of the claim focuses on the Commonwealth Bank not disclosing any climate-related risks as major or material risks. ※When the bank talks about major or material risks to the bank, we say it should be talking about climate change,§ said Banden.In February, Geoff Summerhayes from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, gave a speech saying that business needed to  and begin seeing it as a financial problem. He said: ※Like all risks, it is better they are explicitly considered and managed as appropriate, rather than simply ignored or neglected.§And in June, the G20＊s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), led by Bank of England governor Mark Carney and former mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, recommended .The report recommended banks and other organisations include climate-related risks in their audited annual financial statements.The proposals  controlling US$22tn in funds.Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change in Australia, said putting climate-related risk into the heart of financial reporting means it is treated very differently by the company.※It means that you have a different level of internal governance processes, a higher degree of audit and scrutiny and you report the information in a much more robust and detailed way,§ she said. ※It＊s stepping it up a notch in terms of how seriously companies treat the data.§Herd said a lot of companies 每 not just banks 每 would be watching the case for potential implications any decision might have for their reporting requirements.※For banks as well as all companies, this is an area that is moving very quickly,§ Herd said. ※And certainly from the investor perspective the bar keeps getting raised in terms of what is considered adequate disclosure in terms of climate-related financial risk.§The case focuses on sections 297 and 299A of the Corporations Act. Section 297 says annual financial statements must present a ※true and fair view§ of the financial position and performance of the company. Section 299A says the financial report must contain enough information to allow people to make an informed assessment of the company＊s financial position, business strategies and future prospects.Guy Abrahams, one of the claimants and a chief executive of not-for-profit Climarte Inc, said in a statement: ※We bought Commonwealth Bank shares more than 20 years ago as an investment in our children＊s future.※We are deeply concerned about the serious risks climate change poses to the environment and society. The bank should tell investors about the risks climate change will have on its business.§The Commonwealth Bank has been contacted for comment."

"Two game rangers have been shot dead in Kenya＊s restive north while on a mission to recover stolen cattle.For the last year, Laikipia, one of Kenya＊s most important wildlife regions, has been  and battles between private ranch owners and communities bordering them.Tens of people have been killed or injured as a ravaging drought has driven armed nomadic herders into privately owned conservancies and farms. It is also believed the , in part due to the ethnic and geographic diversity of the area. Laikipia straddles counties divided by those who support the government, and those who oppose it, and tensions are particularly rife as the country prepares for its general election in August. Land invasions have been gathering pace in the last few years, and in many cases wildlife, and those who protect it, are unfortunate victims of the violence. In the most recent incident a group of more than 10 rangers and several other cattle owners pursued stolen heads of cattle after their land had been invaded by pastoralists. The group had reached a village on foot when they were attacked.※They were pursuing seven heads of cattle ... The morans [traditional warriors] in the village attacked them thinking  were being attacked,§ said Samuel Lekimaroro, the head of security at Northern Rangeland Trust (NRT) conservancy told Kenyan newspaper Daily Nation. John Kisio, a survivor of the attack and owner of some of the cows that were stolen, told the Guardian that the ambush seemed to have been planned. ※We told them who we were but they still shot at us,§ Kisio said. He escaped with a broken arm and a gunshot wound to the leg.※The two who died were shot from point blank range by the warriors who pursued us for more than a kilometre,§ Kisio said, adding that he was saved when a villager intervened and convinced his would-be shooter not to pull the trigger.The rangers were employees from three different ranches in Laikipia. One of the deceased was Panale Lenangoro, who has worked for West Gate conservancy since 2006. He was married and had five children.The rangers are police reservists who have been given additional training by the ranches, effectively becoming ranch employees. Police reservists are community members given the mandate by government to act like law enforcement officers in areas that are hard to patrol. They can be employed by any other organisation but when need arises, perform police duties.※This is an indication of how wildlife rangers＊ roles are evolving in northern ,§ said Ian Craig, director of conservation for NRT, which supports the training and the deployment of rangers when required.※The rangers were historically recruited and trained to protect wildlife, but given the proliferation of arms, and the drought, and the massive movement of livestock across the landscape, they are now finding themselves drawn into issues that are unconnected to wildlife,§ Craig added.On , also within Laikipia, with policemen on board was attacked by two armed bandits. More than 20 bullets hit the vehicle.On the previous day, Agget ranch was attacked and 10 bulls stolen. Nearby Loisaba ranch had 17 steers stolen and 10 cows from Suiyan ranch and another 32 steers from Ol Maisor ranch were taken.Estimates of the number of people killed in the violence so far range from 25 to 50, among them , shot dead on his horse while inspecting the damage caused by armed herders who had driven tens of thousands of cattle on his ranch.In March, a senior Kenya  Service officer was shot dead and a ranger injured by suspected poachers at Galana Kulalu near the Tsavo East national park during a shootout with rangers. The death of the officer was the second in less than a month in one of Kenya＊s most ecologically diverse parks troubled for decades by poachers.※They are Kenya police reservists and as such they have a responsibility to help enforce law and order. Yes, that＊s stopping poaching, but increasingly here it means dealing with stock theft, road banditry, and helping the regular police deal with general criminality,§ Craig said. More than 100 wildlife rangers die each year while carrying out their duties. They are often the victims of poachers or others seeking to exploit the resources and animals they protect."																																																			
" always knew that living in  would gift me unusual talents. I can now confidently cross busy traffic with just a little daring and an outstretched palm. I know which of the puddles on the pavement are effluent and which are just muddy water. And I＊ve developed a sharp instinct for insulation.Windows that sit slightly open; outsized gaps between doors and floors; open space in the walls around improperly installed air conditioners: for a week this November I could walk into any room in India＊s heaving capital and identify insulation flaws immediately.Friends outside , informed of this new skill, thought my unlikely interest in nooks and crannies a weird obsession. But I was convinced it was necessary for survival.Diwali, the Hindu festival of light, had reached its peak on the evening of 30 October, with extravagant parties and a spectacular barrage of fireworks across the city. The next morning, Delhi woke with a foul hangover.A coarse, grey mist pressed itself against the windows of my bedroom. An acrid smell, like burning plastic, filled the house. Air-quality monitors in part of the city showed readings of 999, the upper limit of what they could measure.The pollution from thousands of fireworks had combined with road dust, vehicle emissions and the burning of crop residue in neighbouring states to produce . Here is what life is like in a city likened to ※a gas chamber§ by its own chief minister. Eyes burn. Deep breaths become elusive. Tiny pieces of grit crunch between teeth.Voices develop a husky croak that no amount of throat-clearing can shake. Fields of view narrow to less than 100 metres, inducing a sense of claustrophobia. Inside becomes where you go for fresh air.For a week I avoided doing interviews in person, or going out for dinner, or doing anything that might require straying too far from the air purifier running on its highest setting in my bedroom.However, it did grant a handy excuse for wheezing my way through a Saturday morning game of squash. ※Do you need a minute?§ my opponent asked, while I panted in the corner. ※Sure,§ I replied, rueing the buckets of  (buttery lentils) and garlic naan bread I＊d been consuming. ※It must be this bloody air pollution.§Before taking up my post, I had immersed myself in research on Delhi＊s air problems. I learned that  had found more than half the city＊s schoolchildren suffered from compromised lung capacity and would never completely recover.The World Health Organisation says India has the worst rates of respiratory illness in the world, twice as bad as China＊s, and five times that of the UK. The deadliest particles are the tiny ones, less than 2.5 micro-metres in diameter (or a millionth of a metre), because they can travel deep into the lungs, and breach the blood-brain barrier.I pored over the colour-coded system 每 from ※good§ green to ※severe§ burgundy 每 that determined the quality of each day＊s air.By the time I arrived in Delhi four months ago, I was fully prepared, toting a bag of disposable air masks that I had practised wearing, ensuring my entire mouth and nose were covered, not satisfied until each breath sounded like it belonged to Darth Vader.So I was startled to see Delhi＊s residents simply getting on with their lives, walking the streets unmasked, seemingly unaware of the toxic soup of particles that engulfed their city. Everywhere I butted up against indifference. Outside a bar in Delhi＊s Defence Colony district, I asked Indian friends how they coped with knowing they were at such risk from the city＊s air. One lit a cigarette. ※We smoke,§ he shrugged.At a dinner party in the Hauz Khas neighbourhood, over bowls of  (spicy puffed rice), I ruined the mood by regaling guests with statistics and warnings. ※That＊s why each day you spend in Delhi takes two hours off your life,§ I ended one of my disquisitions, to a morose silence broken only by the sound of chewing. The moments when I felt most understood took place inside electronics shops as I browsed for air purifiers: whirring, filtered fans that claimed to reduce the concentration of PM2.5 and other pollutants to safe, single-digit levels.Relatively new on the Indian market, most of the devices are still prohibitively expensive, and so in their advertisements, cannot afford to mince words. ※You think only smoking causes lung cancer?§ one poster read. ※Breathing at home can too.§I hope that awareness of the perils of pollution in Delhi grows. I want my reporting to help spur international attention. But I also understand why it has proved so difficult to stoke popular outrage.Delhi is in many respects a city of rolling crises: September saw deadly outbreaks of dengue fever and ; in October, a new war with Pakistan loomed. This month, more than  with four-hours＊ notice. Perhaps, in this vast city of 18 million people, air pollution simply takes its place in the queue behind more tangible problems. People are resilient. We adapt to our surroundings. I arrived in Delhi with illusions of living inside a purified bubble.Instead, I find the Delhi spirit of essentially, ※shit happens§  rubbing off on me.On clearer days, autumn is a beautiful season in Delhi. The temperature is cool, the mosquitoes are gone, the festival season slows the city＊s pulse and rooftop parties beckon.My obsession with avoiding bouts of bad air, itself unhealthy and unsustainable, is subsiding. I no longer scan rooms for gaps in the insulation. On Saturday I was halfway down my street when I realised I had left my pollution mask at home. I didn＊t go back for it. It was only an orange day 每 ※poor air quality§ 每 after all."																																																			
																																																			
"Four of the world＊s biggest cities are to ban diesel vehicles from their centres within the next decade, as a means of tackling air pollution, with campaigners urging other city leaders to follow suit.The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Athens and  City announced plans on Friday to take diesel cars and vans off their roads by 2025.Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, led the initiative at the  on climate change, taking place in Mexico this week. She said: ※Mayors have already stood up to say that climate change is one of the greatest challenges we face. Today, we also stand up to say we no longer tolerate air pollution and the health problems and deaths it causes, particularly for our most vulnerable citizens.§※Soot from diesel vehicles is among the big contributors to ill health and global warming,§ added Helena Molin Vald谷s, head of the United Nations＊ climate and clean air coalition, noting that more than .Miguel ?ngel Mancera, mayor of Mexico City, said increasing investments in public transport would also help clean the city＊s air, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Giorgos Kaminis, mayor of Athens, said his goal was to remove all cars from the city centre. The city authorities will also work with national governments and manufacturers, and promote electric vehicles and cleaner transport.Recent research has uncovered the scale of the problem, with , as well as millions of other illnesses, .Green campaigners welcomed the announcement, saying it showed that it was possible to clean up big cities. Alan Andrews, lawyer at the NGO ClientEarth, whose legal victory has , said: ※This shows political leaders across the world are waking up to the damage diesel is doing to our health. But 2025 is a long time away when you consider the 467,000 premature deaths caused by air pollution in Europe [alone] every year.§He called on other leaders to ※go further and faster [with] bold new measures§.Jenny Bates, of Friends of the Earth, added: ※This bold move to get rid of diesels, the most polluting vehicles, is exactly what is needed. We need cleaner vehicles and fewer of them. Getting rid of diesel is essential and we must also give people genuine alternatives to driving.§She also called on London＊s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to phase out diesel vehicles from the city by 2025, and for new clean air zones in all of the UK＊s cities and major towns, with funding taken away from roads to promote sustainable alternative transport.Diesel fuel use is a key cause of air pollution in cities, as the engines produce , a harmful gas, and tiny particulates that can lodge in the lungs. These forms of pollution can also interact with other substances to create, in some conditions, a toxic soup.Yet diesel use has been rising in many countries, partly for economic reasons and partly as a consequence of measures to combat climate change 每 diesel vehicles burn fuel more efficiently than conventional petrol engines, reducing carbon dioxide emissions.It is not clear whether diesel vehicles in the four cities will be subject to a total ban, or what areas of the cities will be covered. Some cities already have measures in place intended to reduce congestion and clean up the air, such as low-emission zones that involve traffic restrictions.Last year, the  when it was discovered that some of its diesel cars contained technology to disguise the true level of their harmful emissions."																																																			
"Princess Cruise Lines will pay a US$40m penalty after pleading guilty to seven federal charges in an illegal ocean pollution case that involved one ship＊s use of a so-called magic pipe to divert oily waste into the waters.Miami US attorney Wifredo Ferrer told a news conference the penalty was the largest ever of its kind. A plea agreement filed in federal court also requires , the UK and US-listed parent company of the Princess line, to submit 78 cruise ships across its eight brands to a five-year environmental compliance programme overseen by a judge.Ferrer said the illegal practices came to light when an engineer aboard the Caribbean Princess discovered the ※magic pipe§ in 2013 off the coast of Britain and told investigators about it.Authorities later learned the 952ft ship had been illegally discharging oily water into the ocean since 2005.※Our open seas are not dumping grounds for waste,§ Ferrer said. ※One thing we must never do is take our clear blue oceans for granted.§A single illegal discharge dumped 4,227 gallons of oil-contaminated waste about 20 miles off the coast of England on 26 August 2013, according to court documents.The documents also show illegal practices were found on four other Princess ships, including use of clean ocean water to fool onboard sensors that would otherwise detect dumping of improperly contaminated bilge water. Authorities say cost savings was the motive and that the ship＊s officers and crew conspired to cover up what was going on.John Cruden, assistant attorney general for the US justice department＊s environmental division, said the Caribbean Princess ※violated the law, they covered it up and then they lied about it§.※We＊re sending a strong message in this case to the entire industry.§In a statement Princess said it was ※extremely disappointed§ that employees had violated company policy and federal law regarding discharge of pollutants.

"Experts have challenged a claim by Bj?rn Lomborg＊s Copenhagen Consensus Centre that holding global temperature rises to 2C is a poor investment.In 2015 the education department abandoned plans for Lomborg to set up an Australian Consensus Centre, but gave  to support its Smarter  Development Goals project. The project assessed dozens of development goals and found investment in keeping global temperature rises below 2C would return less than $1 for every $1 spent, which it rated ※poor§ compared with other possible investments.The claim was based on . The finding on the 2C limit was one of the project＊s most controversial, and has been cited in the political debate about whether such targets are worthwhile, as .The report said the 2C target was ※relatively ineffective or there is large uncertainty in the benefit-cost ratio§ because it was ※extremely costly due to a lack of low-carbon energy sources§.But academics have now said Galiana＊s assessment underestimated the harm caused if atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeded 450 parts per million, and has been superseded by advances in renewable energy technology and the .And Galiana herself has conceded ※the paper does not explicitly undertake a benefit/cost analysis of keeping climate change to two degrees§ and that a 2C target might be justified if ※tipping points§ of accelerated environmental damage were considered.Climate economist Peter Howard, the economics director at New York University＊s Institute for Policy Integrity, said the assessment paper provided ※insufficient reasons for abandoning a 2∼C limit§.Howard said the assessment ※misinterprets the main papers that it cites in its defence 每 which actually demonstrate that immediate climate action is critical and that 450ppm is optimal under realistic scenarios§.One such paper, by Derek Lemoine and Haewon McJeon in 2013, used a break-even point based on economic damage estimates in work by Richard Tol in 2009 that have since been revised upwards in 2015 to ※nearly double the value§, according to Howard.In particular, it ※omits various climate impacts including tipping points 每 [which] implies an underestimation of the benefits of the 450ppm goal§.Howard said this and other papers cited concluded the 450ppm target was cost-benefit justified.Lemoine said his paper 每 relied on by the CCC＊s assessment 每 did not seek to estimate the benefits of reaching a 450ppm target, but rather the ※sensitivity to assumptions about these benefits§. Overall, Howard said, the 2C limit was ※a wise investment when combined with investment in energy R&D and adaptation§.※Despite much media attention and repeated negotiations within the [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] framework, if measured by performance, global climate policy has failed,§ the Galiana assessment paper said.The paper argued that meeting the 2C target would require ※immediate and globally coordinated action§ and warned that ※delayed or fragmented action§ would increase the cost of meeting the target.Jessica O＊Reilly, an expert in environmental management and governance, said the assessment paper, dated October 2014, was produced before the Paris agreement ※and therefore makes incorrect claims that international climate diplomacy has ＆failed＊§.The Paris agreement, , bringing together nearly 200 countries under a legal agreement that sets ambitious goals to limit temperature rises.In the agreement,  global temperature rise to well below 2C, and to strive for 1.5C. O＊Reilly noted that the CCC＊s assessment paper ※opens with an introduction that states climate isn＊t one of the millennium development goals§.※Those goals have now expired, replaced by the UN＊s sustainable development goals, one of which, .§※Since 2010, coal-fired electricity generation growth has increased more rapidly than non-fossil sources combined,§ the Galiana assessment paper said.Assumptions about the availability of low-carbon technology ※determine the estimates of the world＊s ability to cost-effectively achieve given atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases,§ it said.Kylie Catchpole, an engineering academic with expertise in solar cells at the Australian National University, said the outlook for renewables was ※rapidly changing§. Her colleague Matthew Stocks said the availability of low-emissions technology was ※no longer an issue§.※More renewable electricity capacity was installed in the last three years than fossil fuels. Renewables are rapidly growing and fossil fuels are slowing,§ Stocks said. ※This is not the result of major breakthroughs, just continued scale and competition driving down the costs of wind and [photovoltaics] in particular.※These costs are coming down much more rapidly than anyone has predicted. New-build wind and [photovoltaics] is now cheaper than fossils fuels.§Catchpole said: ※New generation capacity for photovoltaics (with an extra 50-60GW from wind), while new coal decreased from 71GW in 2015 to 50GW in 2016.§Catchpole, who said a 2C target was ※challenging but achievable§, pointed to dramatic reductions in the cost of photovoltaics, down from US$0.70 a watt in 2014 to about $0.45 in 2016, and of batteries ※by about a factor of two over the last five years§ 每 both trends that are expected to continue. ※Putting all of these trends together, the cost of transitioning to a low emissions electricity system does not have to be high.§Stocks attributed development of low-emissions technologies to ※artificial markets§ 每 such as pricing greenhouse gas emissions or mandating a renewable energy target 每 and said ※research and development alone would not have done this§.Galiana told Guardian Australia her paper had not explicitly undertaken a ※cost-benefit analysis of keeping climate change to two degrees§. ※The two degree goal is not particularly useful in developing policy except as an aspirational goal.§Galiana said achieving the 2C target in the next 50 years ※requires an unprecedented reduction in emissions to well below current levels§. ※It is true that if we are near a tipping point, and we may be, that even with very high costs of reducing emissions to meet the two degree goal may pass a benefit cost analysis.§She said that despite rapid growth in low-carbon technologies, ※they still represent a small share of global energy use ... And, we have yet to develop enabling technologies that deal with the intermittency of large scale integration of these low-carbon technologies,§ she said, a point disputed by Catchpole.※The current state of technology implies that a steep reduction in emissions is equivalent to a reduction in energy use and consequently a reduction in economic output (ie recession).§ Galiana proposed ※moderate emission reduction policies that ramp up as technologies become available ... Strong support for low-carbon innovation and enabling technologies will be key.§ A spokesman for the Copenhagen Consensus Centre responded to questions about the Galiana assessment paper exclusively by referring to other academic works.One  by Richard Tol for the CCC in 2010 found that keeping temperatures to 2.4C ※would generate just $0.02 of climate benefits for each dollar spent,§ the spokesman said, though Tol revised damage estimates upwards in 2015 and the 2010 paper predates advances in renewable technologies.A second  surveyed the literature of cost-benefit analyses of greenhouse gas abatement and found that it was ※not in our collective best interest to stabilise concentrations unless there happens to a cheap, large-scale, carbon-free energy source§. No response was provided by the CCC to claims that low carbon technologies were now available.The spokesman said a third  by William Nordhaus concluded the 2C target was ※infeasible§ and that even reaching a 2.5C target would require a $184 a tonne carbon tax compare with the estimated social cost of carbon of $31 a tonne.※This roughly means paying $184 for a benefit worth $31, or a benefit-cost ratio of 0.17. This, once again, confirms that the 2C target has a benefit-cost ratio of much less than one.§However, the Nordhaus paper measured a ※hard§ limit, which did not account for the ability to overshoot the target and then reduce emissions to reach the 2C target in the long term.

Fortunately, the meltwater did not reach the vault itself, the ice has been hacked out, and the precious seeds remain safe for now at the required storage temperature of -18C.But the breach has questioned the ability of the vault to survive as a lifeline for humanity if catastrophe strikes. ※It was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day,§ Aschim said. ※We must see what we can do to minimise all the risks and make sure the seed bank can take care of itself.§The vault＊s managers are now waiting to see if the extreme heat of this winter was a one-off or will be repeated or even exceeded as climate change heats the planet.

"he Komi Republic in northern  is renowned for its many lakes, but sites contaminated by oil are almost just as easy to find in the Usinsk oilfields. From pumps dripping oil and huge ponds of black sludge to dying trees and undergrowth 〞 a likely sign of an underground pipeline leak 〞 these spills are relatively small and rarely garner media attention.But they add up quickly, threatening fish stocks, pasture land and drinking water. According to the natural resources and environment minister, Sergei Donskoi, 1.5m tonnes of oil are spilled in Russia each year. That＊s more than twice the amount released by the record-breaking Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.The main problem, according to the natural resources ministry, is that 60% of pipeline infrastructure is deteriorated. And with fines inexpensive and oversight lax, oil companies find it more profitable to patch up holes and pour sand on spills 〞 or do nothing at all 〞 than invest in quality infrastructure and comprehensive cleanups, according to activists.※The pipelines are very worn out, they＊re left over from the USSR,§ said Greenpeace research projects coordinator, Vasily Yablokov. ※The oil companies have realised they＊re losing a lot of oil and are starting to replace them, but it＊s laughable. They need to do much more.§While Russia＊s oil and gas production provides more than half the state budget every year, it exacts a huge price on the environment and local residents. A  told Greenpeace it had registered 11,709 pipeline breaks in Russia in 2014. In contrast, Canada  five pipeline accidents (involving human injury) and 133 incidents involving natural gas and oil pipelines in 2014.The Komi Republic is where Russia＊s first oil production facility opened in 1745, and the Soviet Union started developing the country＊s modern oil industry here in the 1960s and 70s. Usinsk, a sleepy town of 39,000 people, is the regional oil hub. The Usinsk oil field is licensed largely to Lukoil, which bought its Komi oil drilling assets from Komitek in 1999 and began expanding production.※More Usinsk oil to the motherland!§ giant letters proclaim on top of one prefab flat block. Just south of the Arctic Circle, the sun doesn＊t even set in Usinsk in the summer, and it＊s reachable by car only when rivers freeze to make ※winter roads§. Komi＊s aging oil infrastructure has been prone to accidents. In 1994, a pipeline break in Usinsk gushed up more than 60,000 tonnes of oil (many estimates put that figure at twice as much), one of the biggest spills ever on land. Spills in 2013, 2014 and 2015 released hundreds of tonnes of oil on to the snow and river ice.Greenpeace says that in 2014, a 10-day ※oil patrol§ by its volunteers discovered 201 contaminated sites (mostly from pipeline breaks) in the Usinsk oilfield, which is licensed largely to Lukoil, and filed official complaints for each. A trip organised by Greenpeace and the local news site 7x7 in July reported that at least six of these sites were still filled with oil.At a meeting with journalists and Greenpeace, Lukoil-Komi representatives said the 201 sites had been investigated and no oil spill was found at 67 of them.However, Greenpeace has photographs of violations at every site. Representatives admitted the subcontractor that checked the sites could have mistaken the coordinates of some of them. According to Lukoil spokesman Sergei Makarov, a new programme by the company has liquidated more than 50 pools of leaked oil.But since satellite imagery has shown likely spills in areas of the Usinsk oilfields that Greenpeace cannot access, the actual number of contaminated sites is likely far higher than 201, Yablokov believes.※It＊s like a train that they＊re laying rails under as it goes, it goes further and they lay more rail, and that train is oil extraction in the regions,§ Yablokov said.Besides the six known sites, Greenpeace said the July visit also found three new oil spills along the way, including one near a site that Greenpeace volunteers removed 20 tonnes of oil from in 2014.At the site of one pipeline break, the Guardian saw that a large amount of oil had been removed by Lukoil workers and the site considered ※reclaimed§. But the haphazard canals criss-crossing it were still full of thick, unctuous water with a rainbow film on top, and white paint on the birch tree trunks could not cover the black trace of oil, Greenpeace says.Locals in the villages around Usinsk complain that the frequent oil spills pollute their drinking water, contaminate the river fish and reindeer they depend on for food and cause chronic health conditions. Statistics obtained in 2010 by local activists from the hospital in Ust-Usa, a village of 1,300 on the Pechora river that has suffered from many of the large spills,  in almost every kind of illness. Nervous system illnesses in adults, for instance, grew from 26 in 1995 to 70 in 2009. In patients under 18 years of age, they skyrocketed from 72 to 254. Spokesman Sergei Makarov said Lukoil-Komi was investing 20bn roubles (?230m) in environmental measures and would change 370km of old pipeline in 2016, out of a 7,000km-long pipeline network in the region. The company reported only six oil spills in 2015, although Makarov admitted ※some of our employees don＊t want to report (spills) because a leak means poor quality work§. In late May, more than 50 residents of Ust-Usa  the effects of oil drilling and plans for a new oil well near the village. Lukoil Komi plans to  its production from 15.8m tonnes of oil in 2014 to 21.5m tonnes in 2019.※We＊re not telling oil companies to leave, we are saying drill in a way so that we can live with clean air and water,§ local biology teacher and activist Yekaterina Dyachkova said. ※Of course we depend on oil companies because there is no other work.§The aftermath of oil spills isn＊t limited to Komi. Northern rivers such as the Pechora carry 500,000 tonnes of oil into the Arctic Ocean every year, the state hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring service  in 2011. More than 11,000 people have signed a Greenpeace  demanding oil companies be required to replace by 2022 all oil pipelines more than 25 years old.Without stricter enforcement, the situation is unlikely to change. The average return on assets for oil companies in Russia was twice as high as in other countries, according to a recent Greenpeace . That＊s thanks to huge government tax breaks and subsidies, as well as ※conditions in which oil companies are able to avoid full financial responsibility for oil spills§ and not replace pipelines, it said.※We need the cost of oil drilling to include protecting nature,§ Yablokov said. ※It won＊t be quite as profitable a business, but we will be able to preserve the environment.§"																																																			
"Eight years ago . Beijing had to spend tens of millions of dollars closing factories, banning cars and trying to engineer the weather. Air pollution was thrust on to the world stage and has stayed there ever since.Now it＊s Rio＊s turn to host the Games and attention has turned to water and basic sanitation. Parts of Guanabara Bay, which will host aquatic events, are , threatening the athletes as well as the 350,000 spectators who may want a dip in the sea.Rio has the image of a rich, beautiful city, but its  testify to the nightmare of its sanitation for people who must live with urban pollution every day. One in three of the more than 10 million inhabitants of the greater metropolitan area live in places that have no connection to a sewerage system, and only about half of the city＊s waste is treated before entering waterways and eventually the ocean.Not surprisingly, diarrheal diseases and childhood sickness are rife. The many rivers that flow through Rio＊s sprawling urban areas into Guanabara Bay were declared biologically dead by scientists years ago and tonnes of raw sewage pour into the sea every day. There are high levels of viruses and algal blooms in the water, as well as industrial contamination and floating debris. A succession of city authorities has promised, tried and failed to clean it up. In Beijing, a wealthy, authoritarian government could simply ban cars and close down factories for the few weeks of the Games and restart them when people went home. But sorting out basic sanitation and hygiene in crowded, chaotic Rio with its many favelas, steep slopes and a cash-strapped administration is far harder. It involves cultural change, huge costs, many different technologies and immense disruption. To widespread community anger, only one waste treatment plant is fully in operation instead of the seven pledged by the city when it bid for the Olympics in 2007. Instead of sanitation being extended to 80% of people, as promised, vast money has been spent on highly visible cable cars, beautification and facilities for tourists and athletes rather than on basic services like waste collection and sewers. Unsurprisingly .There should be no excuses because Rio won its bid to host the Olympics in 2009, giving it years to make good its promises. Nevertheless, some progress has been made. When, a few years ago, the city began to realise it was falling well behind on its Olympic pledges, consultants were called in, and a myriad of solutions proposed. The World Bank, the Dutch development bank and many others all contributed ideas and money, and more than 20 separate major proposals to deal with Rio＊s water pollution and solid waste challenges were accepted. A million more people are now connected to the sewers than 10 years ago and this will increase over the next decade.But Rio is like 1,000 other cities grappling to improve its infrastructure. Rapid industrialisation, population growth and lack of money have overwhelmed local authorities all over the world. About  facilities, and the target in the millennium development goals to halve the proportion of the population without basic sanitation . This week, Eduardo Paes, the mayor of Rio who also chairs the  of global mayors trying to improve the environment of their cities, accepted that Guanabara Bay is not in the pristine state envisaged in 2007. But he said the city is in a far better state than 10 years ago. Gramacho, , has been closed down, public transport extended and improved, 450km of cycle track built, CO2 emissions reduced, old neighbourhoods improved and . ※For every one real we have spent on the Games, we have invested five on ensuring a legacy for the city, through sustainable infrastructure, improved public transport and accessible facilities for our citizens,§ he said.Paes welcomes the international scrutiny of the city. ※The process of preparing for the Games has brought attention to the issues of pollution, waste management and water usage, triggering a discussion within the city and at the state and national level,§ he said.※The Olympics are just the beginning. Politicians, journalists and citizens within Rio and across  have begun to address these environmental issues in a way they never have before.§"																																																			
"here can be few more beautiful city sights in the world than that from the Marina da Gloria, where the  Olympic sailing events will be launched this weekend.Look out from the quayside across Guanabara Bay and the panorama takes in Sugarloaf mountain, the Niteroi bridge and the distant hills of the Serra dos Org?os national park, while behind you are the palm trees of Flamengo Park and the statue of Christ the Redeemer.But this treat for the eyes 每 which will make it the perfect backdrop for TV sports broadcasts 每 is sometimes so polluted with untreated human waste that it can also be an assault on the nose and the immune system, prompting a recommendation from the United Nations that competitors and spectators should spend as little time in the water as possible.In , the World Health Organisation said: ※It is suggested that all athletes should cover cuts and grazes with waterproof plasters prior to exposure, try to avoid swallowing the water, wash/shower as soon as possible after exposure and, as far as possible, minimise their time in the water and avoid going in the water after heavy rainfall if possible.§Many locals, however, ask why it has taken hosting the Olympics for city authorities take notice of a problem that they have had to live with for more than a decade.※The water quality is shit because the sewage flushes in untreated. We all know that. No local would swim in it because we know we would get a disease,§ said Alex Batista, a skateboard instructor who teaches on the Aterro do Flamengo, an area of reclaimed land between the bay and the city centre.That popular wisdom has been reinforced by a series of studies in the past year, which suggest that Guanabara Bay 每 and other aquatic venues the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoa (rowing and canoeing) and Copacabana beach (triathlon and open water swimming) 每 are teeming with pathogens.The Associated Press reported levels of bacteria and viruses so high that swallowing just three teaspoons of water from the bay was likely to lead to . Concentrations of adenoviruses were said to be thousands of times higher than the levels considered safe in the US or Europe.Leading UK medical journal the Lancet has warned that the risk to the health of athletes was ※of concern§.  it said: ※Nearly 1,400 of the more than 10,000 athletes competing at the Games will be directly exposed to the contaminants in this water. Amid a slew of alarming headlines, some athletes have been pre-emptively taking antibiotics, bleaching their oars and training in protective suits.But Maria Neira, the WHO＊s director of Public Health and Environment, which has been advising the Olympic committee , played down , saying the risk of illness has been minimised ※as far as possible§.※If there is a risk, it will be for mild intestinal problems leading to diarrhoea. The athletes will be healthy, so for them the risk may be less than for normal populations,§ she told the Guardian.Nonetheless, UN monitoring has revealed water quality in Guanabara bay and the marina area that WHO guidelines categorise as poor or very poor. Cycling along the bayside on Tuesday, it was not hard to see why. Channels near Botafogo and Flamengo discharged foul-smelling murky waters that were supposed to have been treated. On the beach, there were hundreds of people sunbathing, playing volleyball, drinking beer and chatting 每 but very few who ventured into the waters.※It＊s very dirty,§ said Tais Montero, a student who lives nearby. ※I only have a dip in extreme circumstances 每 if it is very hot and the shower is not working.§ Further along the coast, retiree Anibal Rodrigues was fishing on some rocks and lamenting his poor luck. He had caught just one small fish in an hour, but he said 20 years ago it would have been six or seven. ※The pollution has got worse. The fish don＊t like that.§ Nonetheless, in this part of the bay, the water looked and smelled much cleaner and there was little floating rubbish beyond a couple of plastic bottles. Certainly, the wildlife had not yet given up, proven by a small turtle that swam by.The worst affected areas are further to the north of the city, where low-income favela communities are concentrated and government investment in water systems and sewage treatment is inadequate.As part of its Olympic bid, the state of Rio de Janeiro committed to expand and upgrade the system so that 80% of sewage is treated. There has been progress but it has fallen far short of this goal.Since 2009, the state-run water company CEDAE claims to have spent more than ?500m on tripling sewage treatment in the bay, but still less covers less than half of residents.The city mayor, Eduardo Paes, has lamented the state government＊s failure to clean up Guanabara Bay, but he said the Olympics had brought improvements in some areas.※Our pollution reduction efforts have been successful in that Olympic sailing events will take place on the bay, close to the mouth where it is cleanest. The process of preparing for the Games has brought attention to the issues of pollution, waste management and water usage.§Alberto Chebabo, an expert on infectious diseases at Rio＊s Federal University hospital, agreed that the risks varied around the bay. At the northern end, he said waters were not remotely suitable for swimming, but nearer the mouth 每 where the sailing events will be concentrated 每 he said the bay was relatively clean. In any case, he said sailors who have been training here over the past year are likely to have built up antibodies against many of the viruses in the water. However, he and other experts caution that weather is also a key factor. If it rains, far more sewage and rubbish flows into the bay and a much wider area is polluted.At the marina on Tuesday, competitors appeared to have resigned themselves to the situation and would rather focus on the event. ※We sailors don＊t talk about this among ourselves. It＊s not a big issue for us. I think the problems have been exaggerated in the media,§ said Sofian Bouvet, a member of the French sailing team.※This bay is a great place to sail. I have trained here 11 times and I have never become sick. It＊s a fact that the water isn＊t clean, but it is not surprising for a city of this size. These problems existed for many years. Why is it only now that people talk about them?§Neira said water quality varied from one site to another. ※The data we are seeing suggests that water quality is within WHO guidelines off Copacabana beach where athletes will be swimming and highly exposed. The risk of illness at sites near theMarina da Gl車ria and Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon where they are not swimming is very limited§.In new advice, the UN said that monitoring showed that some sites failed to meet Brazilian water quality standards and would be classed under WHO guidelines as poor or very poor. ※In Guanabara Bay and the marina areas there have been poor quality results but they are starting to come into compliance,§ said Neira. quality is likely to vary throughout the day depending on sunshine and rainfall, but organisers will inspect tall sites and receive data allowing them to cancel competitions if pollution levels are too high.Athletes competing in aquatic events should be familiar with the risks of water-borne infections: only five years ago former British Olympic rower Andy Holmes died from Weil＊s syndrome caused by infection with leptospira caught from the fresh water of Lincolnshire in England.Mayor Paes said the water pollution had improved. ※I welcome this scrutiny because it is generating a debate that will benefit the city 每 and the country 每 for decades to come. Guanabara Bay is not yet the pristine body of water we hope it will be one day, [but] it is far cleaner today than at the start of the bid process.§As part of its Olympic bid, the state of Rio de Janeiro committed to install sewers and water treatment facilities in 80% of communities ahead of the Games. But progress has been very slow and this goal is not even coming close to being achieved.According to the city authorities, nearly 70% of the residents living in the Guanabara Bay watershed still lack basic sewage treatment and the large number of people living in favelas (※slums§) makes it extremely difficult to bring in sewer lines."																																																			
																																																			
"California＊s governor, Jerry Brown, officially declared an end to the state＊s historic drought Friday, but warned that it must be prepared for the future. ※This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,§ Brown said in a statement. ※Conservation must remain a way of life.§ The governor lifted the drought emergency in all  counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where emergency drinking water projects will continue to help address diminished groundwater supplies.The governor＊s order, which came as a springtime storm bears down on the waterlogged state, keeps in place some conservation measures. conservation will become a way of life in the nation＊s most populous state, said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the state water resources control board, who led conservation planning. Officials already have started charting long-term rules to make California more resilient as climate change makes weather patterns more severe.  ※There＊s a greater appreciation of just how precious water is,§ she said. ※We＊ve got to plan for longer droughts.§ Cities and water districts throughout the state will be required to continue reporting their water use each month, said the governor＊s order, which also bans wasteful practices, such as hosing off sidewalks and running sprinklers when it rains. New rules are expected to make such bans permanent. Officials say they will work aggressively to stop leaks that waste water.The drought strained native fish that migrate up rivers, , and forced farmers in the country＊s leading agricultural state to rely heavily on groundwater, with some tearing out orchards. It also dried up wells, forcing hundreds of families in rural areas to drink bottled water and bathe from buckets.Brown declared the drought emergency in 2014, and officials later ordered mandatory conservation for the first time in state history. Regulators last year relaxed the rules after a rainfall was close to normal. But monster storms this winter erased nearly all signs of drought, blanketing the Sierra Nevada with deep snow, California＊s key water source, and boosting reservoirs. Susan Atkins of the charity Self-Help Enterprises said the drought was not over for more than 900 families who have large water tanks in their yards because their wells dried up during the years-long drought. Most of them are in Tulare County, a farming powerhouse in central California＊s San Joaquin Valley. Atkins said she still received calls from people whose wells were running dry and needed a tank and bottled water. ※In no way is it over,§ she said of the drought. ※We will run out of money before we run out of people that need help.§ "

"Experts have argued against subsidising insurance premiums for people in cyclone or flood-prone areas as the multi-million dollar cleanup continues after , saying that will only provide short-term relief.The insurance bill for damage caused by the cyclone, which  before causing widespread damage in northern Queensland and  and  flooding in the state＊s south-east and northern New South Wales, reached $410m on Thursday and is predicted to top $1bn.A number of homes and businesses, particularly in the NSW town of Lismore, were reportedly uninsured or without flood insurance, because premiums for flood insurance had climbed as high as $30,000 a year.It has sparked renewed calls for a review of the insurance regulations covering natural disasters.But Justine Bell-James, an expert in environmental and insurance law from the University of , said moving to reduce premiums just pushed the cost of recovery on to government and would not reduce the scale of the damage.※If we are just covering the cost of the premium that isn＊t going to improve anything in the future,§ Bell-James told Guardian Australia. ※All the other costs 每 loss of income, loss of residence, psychological damage, are still going to occur. We are going to have the same problems in the future with insurance premiums going higher and higher.§Bell-James said funding should instead go toward mitigation measures such as flood levees and ensuring houses are built to a cyclone standard.That was the conclusion of a Productivity Commission report following , which recommended the federal government increase disaster mitigation funding to $200m a year, and also the conclusion drawn by the northern Australia insurance premiums taskforce in 2016.Bell-James said existing mitigation measures 每 such as the flood levee in Lismore, which was breached when flood waters reached the town last week 每 should also be reviewed to ensure they can withstand more severe flood and storm events under climate change.※We use the language of a one-in-100-year flood, but what that really means is there＊s a 1% chance of that flood happening any given year,§ she said. ※Under climate change, that could increase to a 5% or even 10% chance.§ Insurance Council of Australia spokesman Campbell Fuller said government intervention in the insurance market ※would have little impact on affordability, would risk encouraging inappropriate development, and would expose taxpayers to billions of dollars of losses§.Fuller said the industry was pushing for a greater government spend in permanent mitigation measures, including a stricter land use planning and building codes. He also defended the availability of flood insurance, saying 96% of all household policies included flood insurance, up from 3% prior to the 2011 floods. ※The premium charged reflects the flood or other natural hazard risk to each property based on the latest available government data and the insurer＊s underwriting criteria,§ he said. Insurance premiums in northern Queensland increased by 80% between 2005/2006 and 2012/2013, the period covering Cyclone Larry, the Mackay storm, , and the Brisbane floods, according to a 2014 report by Australian government actuary Peter Martin. Premiums for Brisbane in the same period increased by 45%, while premiums in Sydney and Melbourne increased 12%.Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said the price increase was unsustainable and left many people in the highest-risk areas unable to afford insurance. ※When homeowners can＊t afford insurance in disaster prone areas, there＊s clearly a big problem with the market,§ he said.Susan Quinn, insurance policy expert from the Consumer Action Law Centre, said there was currently no requirement that coverage offered by insurance companies is appropriate for the person seeking insurance, so long as the limits of the policy were clearly set out in the policy documents, which 80% of people do not read. ※Ultimately that assumption is that you buy insurance and automatically assume that is going to cover you for the things that might happen to your house, but that＊s not guaranteed under law,§ she said.Quinn said updating the minimum standard cover definition, which was set in 1984, and requiring insurance companies to explicitly state when they are offering less than standard cover, would make things fairer for consumers."

Why? Because the UK＊s membership of the EU has been a virtually unalloyed good for the environment.

But the Common Agricultural Policy was improving its approach to the environment and supports the farmers who put food on our tables every day. They are now in an agonising limbo.

"The government＊s killing targets for the controversial badger cull in England are ※deliberately being biased down§, according to a leading animal population expert.The badger cull, now , is part of efforts to reduce the scourge of tuberculosis in cattle but has been . Farmers failed to meet the targets for badgers shot in the first culls and the lower targets have been easier to achieve. But scientists warn that lower targets run the risk of actually increasing TB in cattle, because the remaining badgers roam more widely and can spread the disease further afield.※The targets are being based on poor estimates of [badger] population size and are deliberately being biased downwards,§ said Prof Tim Coulson, at the University of Oxford, who was a member of the government＊s  that scrutinised the first year of culling in 2013 before being disbanded.This less accurate method produces a population estimate with very wide error bars and, rather than using the central estimate to calculate the cull target, the government is using the very lowest figure at the bottom of the range of uncertainty. This leads to a cull target likely to be much lower than needed to remove a high proportion of the badgers. ※The tools are out there to do this properly,§ Coulson said. The ※gold standard§ method, he said, was to capture and identify badgers and then recapture them to calculate a good estimate of the population before and after culling, but that this was discontinued after the first year of culling: ※The reason for that was primarily financial.§Badger populations are now estimated using sett numbers and other landscape features which Coulson said was not very accurate. Furthermore, the government was setting the killing target at the lowest end of these estimates, he said. Nigel Gibbens, the UK＊s chief veterinary officer and also attending a , defended the approach. He said the government had moved from a ※research methodology§ in the first year to a more ※practically deliverable§ approach, which was adjusted as data from culling came in.※We are applying a practical opening position to set a figure, then using the reality of what happens when culling takes place to understand what is actually happening on the ground,§ he said. ※I think that is a sensible and defensible methodology.§Prof Sheila Bird, a statistician and member of the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs＊ , said: ※That sounds a bit like moving the goalposts.§ In 2013, then environment secretary Owen Paterson explained the failure of the cull to meet its killing targets by saying ※§. Bird said using a ※fiddle factor§ did not ※do the culling any service§.The  but experts said the expansion ※§. TB is a serious problem for farmers, with  at a cost to the taxpayer of about ?100m. The government is also implementing stricter cattle testing and movement rules to tackle the problem and researching both badger and cattle vaccines.※No-one wants the long term solution to be culling in perpetuity,§ Gibbens said. ※We are where we are with regret, not because it is the place we want to be.§ He said cattle-to-cattle transmission was a crucial factor to tackle, but that badger-to-cattle transmission was also important. ※If we don＊t deal with both, we won＊t get rid of the disease.§ Wales has seen a decline in cattle TB in recent years, after stricter testing and other measures were implemented. But Christianne Glossop, Wales＊s chief vet, said culling was set to be used this year to target farms with longstanding TB infections.Scientists have warned that small-scale culls also run the risk of making TB worse overall by dispersing badgers. But Glossop said: ※I know there is a risk attached to this approach but I think it is proportionate.§In the Republic of Ireland, about 6,000 badgers have been culled each year since 2000. This and other measures has seen TB in cattle fall. But James O＊Keeffe, head of the Department of Agriculture＊s  Unit, said that, following successful trials, the nation would switch to mostly badger vaccination in 2018. He said culling was not sustainable in the long term: ※We need to eliminate TB, but also make sure we don＊t eliminate badgers.§Badger vaccination projects in England have been postponed due to a global shortage of TB vaccine. But O＊Keeffe said: ※If you pay for it, you get it. We have had no problem getting it.§Ireland has a much lower density of badgers than England and zoologist Prof John Krebs warned: ※What worked in Ireland might not work in England.§ In 2012, Krebs described the .

The cause is increasing ocean temperatures.※Is the Great Barrier Reef dying due to climate change caused by man＊s selfishness and greed?§ asks Delingpole, before giving a long list of people and groups who he thinks will answer yes, including ※the Guardian§ and ※any marine biologist§.※Have they been out there personally 每 as I have 每 to check. No of course not,§ says Delingpole.Yes. James Delingpole has been out there ※personally§ to check, but all those other people haven＊t. He doesn＊t say when he went but he has . It was back in late April 2012. Everything , he said, based on that one visit. I can＊t find any times when he has mentioned another trip since. So here＊s the rhetorical question 每 one that I can barely believe I＊m asking, even rhetorically.Why should there not be equivalence between Delingpole＊s single trip to the reef (apparently taken 10 years after a previous severe case of bleaching and four years before the one that followed) at one spot on a reef system that spans the size of Italy [takes breath] and the  traversing the entire length of the reef?I mean, come on? Why can those two things 每 Delingpole making a boat trip with mates and a coordinated and exhaustive scientific monitoring and data-gathering exercise 每 not be the same? So it seems we are now at a stage where absolutely nothing is real unless you have seen it for yourself, so you can dismiss all of the photographs and video footage of bleached and dead coral, the testimony of countless marine biologists (who, we apparently also have to point out, have been to the reef ) and the observations made by the government agency that manages the reef.Senator Pauline Hanson and her One Nation climate science-denying colleagues  by taking a dive on a part of the reef that had escaped bleaching and then claiming this as proof that everything was OK everywhere else.This is like trying to disprove to a doctor that you have two broken legs by showing him an MRI scan of your head (which may or not reveal the presence of a brain), and then being annoyed when he doesn＊t accept your evidence.It＊s as though we＊ve reached peak denial.Last year＊s bleaching on the reef was the worst episode recorded to date. The current fourth mass bleaching has scientists again taking to the field.This month a study , and co-authored by 46 scientists, found these three episodes had impacted reefs ※across almost the entire Great Barrier Reef marine park§. Only southern offshore reefs had escaped.Corals bleach when they are exposed to abnormally high ocean temperatures for too long. Under stress, the corals expel the algae that give them their colour and more of their nutrients. Corals can recover but, as the study explains, even the fastest growing and most vigorous colonisers in the coral family need between 10 and 15 years to recover.After the 2016 bleaching, a quarter of all corals on the reef, mostly located in the once ※pristine§ northern section, died before there was a chance for recovery.In a further blow, the study looked at factors such as improving water quality or reducing fishing pressure and asked if these had helped corals to resist bleaching. In each case, they found they did not (although they do give reefs that survive a better chance to recover).Essentially, the study found the only measure that would give corals on the reef a fighting chance was to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The lead author of the study, Prof Terry Hughes of James Cook University (who is this week carrying out aerial surveys of the current bleaching episode), told my  podcast:Some commentators have suggested a key cause of the 2016 bleaching was the El Ni?o weather pattern that tends to deliver warmer global temperatures.But Hughes says that before 1998, the Great Barrier Reef went through countless El Ni?os without suffering the extensive mass bleaching episodes that are being seen, photographed, filmed and documented now.Dr Mark Eakin, head of  Reef Watch at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the cause of the modern-day mass bleaching episodes on reefs across the world was the rise in ocean temperatures.This, says Eakin, is ※being driven largely by humans and our burning of fossil fuels§.Government ministers at federal and state levels, of both political stripes, claim they want to protect the reef.They are running this protection racket, somehow, by continuing to support plans for .That＊s some more hubris right there."																																																			
"mall tweaks to flight paths could reduce the effects that aircraft have on climate by as much as 10%, a new study shows. For a roughly 1% increase in operating costs, airlines could make significant climate change cuts by optimising their routes according to the weather, time of day and time of year.Aircraft affect Earth＊s climate by emitting greenhouse gases, and creating contrails, which alter the way radiation is reflected back to space. An estimated 5% of manmade climate change is caused by global aviation, and this number is expected to rise. But Keith Shine, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, and his colleagues show this could be reduced if flights were routed to avoid the regions where their emissions have the greatest effect on climate.The scientists modelled routings for 800 daily transatlantic flights, under typical winter and summer weather patterns. Using a chemistry climate model, they investigated 85 flight path variations, and worked out which were most ＆climate-friendly＊.Their results, which are published in , found that some routes had a much larger effect on climate than others. For example, contrails (which usually cause warming by trapping radiation) could be reduced by avoiding regions where the atmosphere is saturated with ice crystals, because these conditions encourage the formation of contrails. The increased fuel and staff costs (associated with rerouting) would add about 1% to operating costs, the scientists calculate. ※Climate-friendly routing of aircraft has an exciting potential to decrease the climate impact of aviation, without the need for costly redesign of aircraft, their engines and airports. With more targeted research, it could become a reality in the next 10 years,§ says Shine."

"Michael McCarthy (, 1 April) highlighted my idea of developing a GCSE in natural history. It is heartening that so many people agree. In response to those who see problems, ranging from the lack of suitably qualified teachers to natural history being just a subset of biology, I would like to stress that the situation for nature in the UK is so serious there is now no room for negativity. The  showed that Britain ※is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world§. Our children are growing up in a land that has seen a thinning out of the mass of nature by more than 50% in the past 40 years. There is less of everything 每 less song, less colour, less abundance. We must put nature back into the heart of the education system, and take it out of the realms of eccentric hobbies and into mainstream thinking.Developing a nature qualification will be challenging, but it will be worth every furrowed brow if we encourage future generations of young people to be more attuned to the world around them and have the knowledge to protect it. See . Michael McCarthy is spot-on to recognise that screens have contributed to a nature deficit. Unfortunately, this also includes many adults 每 even farmers and landowners.In the classroom, biology lost its connection with nature with the exploration of cellular activity and chemical pathways. Zoology and botany became one, all concentrated at the end of an electron microscope. There was then no time for observing nature, so children lost their nature tables and their outdoor classrooms.There may be no time for nature on the GCSE syllabus (although why the school day is not at least an hour longer is a mystery to me), but nature study should certainly become part of infant and junior education. Some of us oldies might even teach it. At my country school in Buckinghamshire we had regular nature walks from the earliest years. West Wycombe hill opposite the school was our break and lunchtime playground, where we roamed in all directions, collecting ※eating grass§, whacking fungus off trees and decapitating toadstools. I spent half my time in the woods, making camps, riding ※bogies§ made with old pram wheels, climbing trees, and following birds and squirrels. I am sure those 11 years in easy contact with nature gave me autonomy and self-assurance.I was told in 1996 that the school no longer used the hill as a playground, ※because of dogs§, though I suspect that stranger danger had a bigger part to play.As for a GCSE in natural history 每 start in primary school."																																																			
"With more and more of the world＊s population living in cities, we need to get urban transport right. That means making sure that people and goods can move around easily and cheaply. It also means ensuring that city transport systems don＊t damage people＊s health, as diesel and to a lesser extent petrol are currently doing in London and other UK cities.Air pollution in our cities regularly contravenes EU limits. London breached its annual air pollution limit for 2017 in just five days. Decreasing vehicle emissions while maintaining or improving commuter journeys is a complex challenge and decisions made today about our transport systems will influence generations to come. The government set out its plans to tackle the problem last week. The main plank of its strategy is a commitment to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040. The ambition to switch to electric vehicles is a signal for real change and is the direction we need to go, despite the associated upheaval and challenges in the form of extending battery range and life, ensuring adequate and conveniently positioned charging stations, generating enough clean electricity and overcoming the general lack of knowledge about the cost and convenience of owning an electric vehicle.The government＊s plan, however, does not go nearly far enough. Our cities need fewer cars, not just cleaner cars. One issue is that electric vehicles will not sufficiently reduce particulate matter (PM), the other toxic pollutant emitted by road transport. This is because PM components include not only engine emissions, but also a contribution from brake and tyre wear and road surface abrasion. Governments don＊t currently pay much attention to PM, but it is in fact highly polluting, with strong links to cardiopulmonary toxicity.As London continues to grow in size and population, even zero-emission vehicles are not the complete answer to poor air quality. The capital＊s population grew at twice the rate of the UK as a whole between 2011 and 2015. The safe and efficient movement of people around the city can only be achieved through a clean and expanded mass transit system served by buses, overground trains and the underground system - and as much active transport in the form of walking and cycling as is feasibly possible. We need to give people more and easier options to get about without necessarily owning a car and using it for short journeys. Encouragingly, attitudes toward car ownership do appear to be changing. Younger Londoners are increasingly replacing little-used vehicles with car club membership and ride-sharing apps. But moving toward such an overhaul in our capital＊s transport system and public mindset depends on continued and exacting scientific research and its translation into realistic and effective policies. We must also champion the value of exercise and continue to make public transport the convenient option.Nearly two-thirds of the world＊s population will live in urban areas by 2050. How we manage and plan for growing urbanisation will be key to so many global aspirations from improving air quality and human health, maintaining economic success and combatting climate change. If cities everywhere should be promoting healthier and non-polluting transport policies, it is particularly important that London does. The city is hugely influential. Where it leads, others will follow. "																																																			
" on the Antarctic seabed is likely to be far more affected by global warming than previously thought, say scientists who have conducted the most sophisticated study to date of heating impacts in the species-rich environment.Growth rates of some fauna doubled 每 including colonising moss animals and undersea worms 每 following a 1C increase in temperature, making them more dominant, pushing out other species and reducing overall levels of biodiversity, according to the study published on Thursday in The researchers who conducted the nine-month experiment in the Bellingshuan Sea say this could have alarming implications for marine life across the globe as temperatures rise over the coming decades as a result of manmade greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. of the British Antarctic Survey and Smithsonian Environmental Research Center said she was not expecting such a significant difference. ※The loss of biodiversity is very concerning. This is an indication of what may happen elsewhere with greater warning.§Sub-zero conditions near the south pole mean there are comparatively few species on the usually frozen land, but below the ice, the relative lack of pollution, traffic and fishing has left an abundance of marine life that divers and biologists compare to coral reefs.Previous studies of warming impacts have focused on single species, but the latest research examines an assemblage of creatures.Twelve identical 15cm sq heat plates were set in concrete on the seabed. Four were warmed by 1C, four by 2C and four left at ambient temperature as a control. At 1C, a species of bryozoan moss () became utterly dominant on the four plates. Within two months it reduced the evenness and diversity of the species spread. The researchers also found the marine worm  grew an average 70% larger than those under ambient conditions.At 2C, the results from different plates varied with different growth rates of different species. The researchers speculate that this may be because the higher increase in temperature had a greater shock impact.Ashton said further longer-term studies should be conducted but the overall trend was already clear. ※The indication of change being more than anticipated is fairly reliable. This is the best data we have to date.§Until recently, most of the coverage of temperature rises has focused on the north pole, where the shrinking of arctic ice has been most visibly dramatic. But concerns are growing about the impact of global warming on the far bigger southern ice cap.Earlier this year, the United Nations weather agency announced that temperatures in the Antarctic recently hit a record high. An Argentine research base near the northern tip of the continent recorded a balmy 17.5C in March 2015, the World Meteorological Organisation revealed. The vast continent contains 90% of the world＊s fresh water, most of it locked in ice that is several kilometres thick. The effects of climate change are not uniform, but concerns grew in July when a trillion tonne block of the Larsen C ice shelf .The region is also steadily turning greener due to the increased growth of surface moss. UK-based scientists published showing that growth rates of moss have accelerated more than fourfold since 1950.The latest study suggests the trend could become more evident on the sea bed as well as the land surface."																																																			
"Another 1,000 badgers are set to be killed this autumn and winter in the two UK counties where the controversial cull began four years ago. Natural England confirmed on Wednesday that  in Gloucestershire and Somerset.  The original culls were authorised for four years and critics argue the move to introduce supplementary culling shows the policy is not working.  In the coming days new culling areas are expected to be announced as far north as Cheshire and as far east as Wiltshire that could see as many as 10,000 badgers killed in the next few months. So far almost 15,000 badgers have been culled since 2013.  Activists are preparing to disrupt culls in Somerset, Gloucestershire and any other areas that are revealed. New tactics include saboteurs investing in detectors for the radios that marksmen and women are known to carry and the use of drones fitted with infra-red cameras to help them pick up shooters and badgers caught in traps.  Natural England said supplementary culling would take place annually for the next five years in Gloucestershire and Somerset. It said start dates would be decided by the companies licensed to carry out the culling.  A letter to the company authorised to carry out the cull in Gloucestershire said the minimum number of badgers it should aim to kill was 160 and the maximum allowed was 580. The minimum in Somerset has been set at 140 and the maximum 610.  The cull in England is part of the government＊s attempt to reduce tuberculosis in cattle.  But Jay Tiernan, of direct action group Stop the Cull, said: ※Natural England＊s authorisation of continued culling in both Somerset and Gloucestershire can only be viewed as an admission of a complete failure of the culls to address bovine TB in cattle.§ He added: ※The culls in both areas will continue to be disrupted. It makes no difference how many new zones are rolled out; there will now always be locals in all areas going out and doing their best to stop the pointless killing of badgers.§The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said supplementary culling was being carried out following  Nigel Gibbens, that keeping badger populations low would help manage the disease risk. A Defra spokesman said: ※Earlier this year we announced plans to license supplementary badger control in areas that have successfully completed intensive culls, allowing them to maintain disease control benefits for many years to come in line with plans set out in the TB strategy. Licences for supplementary badger control have been issued for two areas.§ Last week the Guardian revealed that hundreds of thousands of taxpayers＊ pounds  linking them directly with police.Police have advised the government to invest in the same communications system they use to make it easier for officers to get to conflicts with cull saboteurs in remote areas where mobile phone signal is poor."																																																			
"While I have the greatest sympathy for those who have lost friends, family, pets or property in the Texas floods (, 30 August), I am disgusted at the relative number of column inches and amounts of airtime devoted to its coverage. During precisely the same period huge areas of Bangladesh, Nepal and India are suffering an even greater catastrophe, with 1,200 plus lives lost and millions made homeless. Let＊s get some balance here. America is a rich country and will cope, despite inept leadership. Or are we saying that American lives are worth more?. The contrast between the coverage of floods in Texas and floods in South Asia is stark. Live updating of trivia as well as important events from Houston; the odd report from India, Nepal,  and elsewhere. There are probably many more people of South Asian heritage in this country than American. The implicit message is that they, and their relatives, are far less important than a pet in Houston. I don＊t want Texas coverage reduced, but please take more notice of the rest of the world. The probability of these extreme weather events has increased as a result of global warming. Focusing on America might have been justified if  had used his visit to Texas to announce the US＊s return to the Paris climate accord. In the absence such good news, can we assume that the UK media values an American life at 80 times that of an Asian one? ※Houston, Texas, after being deluged by over 76cm (30 inches) of rain§; ※By yesterday the region had been hit by up to 9tn US gallons of rainfall 每 as much in two days as it normally receives in a year and the equivalent of a cube of water two miles high§ (, 29 August). The services in Houston and your reporters struggle to give ordinary understanding to the volume of water involved. Metrication can assist. One millimetre of rain is one litre of water on every square metre of ground. 76cm of rain is 760 litres (or if we wish to mix larger imperial volumes, 150 gallons) of water on every square metre of ground.

"Australian states and territories are powering ahead, developing policies that will meet the federal government＊s internationally agreed greenhouse gas emission targets, with , the ACT and Tasmania leading the race., South Australia is leading the race, with the ACT and Tasmania not far behind, according to a report by the Climate Council.Compared on a series of measures including penetration of renewable energy, the percentage of households with solar, as well as emissions and renewable energy targets, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and New South Wales are at the back of the pack, with Victoria and Queensland in the middle.Australia＊s greenhouse gas emissions have been rising ever since the Coalition government repealed the carbon tax in 2014. The federal government＊s own projections show their policies will cause emissions to continue to rise for decades to come.But in the midst of the ongoing federal policy vacuum, every state and territory besides Western Australia has ※gone it alone§ and developed strong renewable energy and emissions reduction policies.South Australia leads the country with 47% of its electricity sourced from renewable sources, followed by the ACT at 22%.  sourced 92% of its electricity from renewable sources, but that was dominated by large-scale hydro electricity.The Northern Territory sourced just 2% of its electricity from renewable sources, sitting behind Western Australia and Queensland at 7%. Victoria sourced 12% from renewables while NSW sat at 17%.Queensland led the country when it comes to solar households, with 32% of homes having solar panels. That just pipped South Australia, which had 31%.While both Western Australia and the Northern Territory scored poorly on most measures, there appeared to be grassroots momentum there for solar rooftops, with the biggest increases in solar penetration over the past year happening in those states. Western Australia jumped almost three percentage points to more than 25% penetration, and the Northern Territory jumped 2.7 percentage points to 11.4% 每 a figure that was still the lowest in the country.The ACT and Tasmania had the strongest renewable energy targets, with the former aiming to implement a 100% target by 2020 and the latter by 2022. The ACT＊s aggressive and bipartisan renewable energy policies delivered the lowest energy costs in the country for consumers.Every state except Western Australia and the Northern Territory had targets to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.Those policies, combined with a surge in grassroots activity and market-driven closure of coal power plants, look set to easily cut Australia＊s emissions by more 28% below 2005 levels, as Australia committed to following the Paris Agreement in 2015. That was the conclusion of  earlier in the year, which concluded: ※The commonwealth government will receive credit for state renewable policies that contribute to meeting the 2030 emissions target, while admonishing them for any energy security issues that may result.※Every state and territory, with the exception of Western Australia, is taking energy and climate policy into their own hands, with strong renewable energy targets or net zero emissions targets in place,§ said Climate Council councillor and energy expert Andrew Stock.※States and territories previously lagging (NT, NSW and WA), are now stepping up the pace, joining the enormous progress we＊re seeing across the nation,§ he said.Climate Council member and former president of BP Australasia, Greg Bourne, said Australians are embracing solar energy in droves, with more than 5.6GW generated on the rooftops of 1.7 million homes.※Australia is one of the sunniest countries in the world, so it＊s no surprise we＊ve already rolled out enough solar to power the lights at the MCG every day for 20,000 years,§ he said.States leading the way without federal coordination was described as a ※a messy dog＊s breakfast§ by the Grattan Institute＊s Tony Wood, who went on to say the unilateral state action was ※understandable with federal ?climate change inaction§."

"On 4 September 2015 I received a text message that turned my life upside down.It was from the Department of Primary Industries stating that Fullerton Cove, a bay of water near Williamtown airforce base in New South Wales, where I have made my living as a third-generation fisherman for decades, was closed immediately to commercial fishing due to an unknown contaminate.These four lines meant my ability to earn an income was substantially altered, and made parts of my business worthless overnight. I＊d spent the last few months preparing for the season to open. Until now, the weather conditions meant it was predicted to be one of the biggest seasons in years. Now we were looking at financial ruin with no redundancy payment, no compensation, no notice period and simply no answers.We now know that the Department of Defence and the NSW Environmental ProtectionAuthority were aware that dangerous chemicals from firefighting foam used on the Williamtown airforce base had been leaching into surrounding properties and waterways for years. However, for at least two years it ※studied§ the flow of material without seeing any reason to inform us that the water we were drinking and washing in, the food that we were eating, the very soil under our feet, may well be killing us slowly.The first community meeting was the biggest buck-passing event I＊ve ever witnessed. A room full of authorities and agencies 每 from the health department to the water department and defence 每 and no one wanted to talk, they just kept passing the questions on to each other. This set the ongoing pattern as we were stonewalled and provided no way forward. Within hours of my first text, there were media reports that our property, which my family and I had lived on for decades, was within the ※red zone§ of contamination. This meant that my entire family may have been exposed to potentially life-threatening chemicals called perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). At the time, I was uncertain of the medical concerns we could be facing or the long-term implications that PFOA and PFOS would have. I＊d worked and lived with this chemical for over 35 years and the worry about its impact on my family and friends made me feel physically sick and led to many sleepless nights. In the absence of information, speculation started about cover ups, feeding our fury, anger, distrust and disappointment about this unfolding event.But as weeks passed, a new announcement was made that the fishing grounds would be closed for a further month, then the next announcement was a closure of nine months. That was the entire season gone. We were fast approaching Christmas and bills were mounting as we were unable to work. Being unable to earn a normal income was a humiliating and degrading event after being self-sufficient my whole life. The only action from the government 每 which had caused the problem 每 was to offer a small amount to maintain our idle business and some access to Centrelink payments. The Salvation Army offered support at this extremely stressful time of our lives, which we were grateful for. And it hasn＊t been getting better. The contaminate continued to flow from the base into the surrounding drains and ultimately to the waterways. At every step, the Department of Defence seems to address the contamination it has caused by downplaying the situation, providing information slowly, secretively and determinedly refusing to take responsibility. For example, rather than the department keeping us informed about the latest efforts to clean up the mess, it is only through our own research that the community discovered it had been listed on the dangerous chemical registrar many years before. So why was this chemical allowed to remain stored in an unsealed storage pond slowly seeping into the drains? Defence staff are constantly rotated, perhaps to ensure that no personal connection is formed to the community. Information is always minimal and based on the assumption that these proven dangerous chemicals are actually safe.However, as we have researched US studies where the science is more advanced or less covered up, we have become more worried. Many residents have become so concerned, particularly for their children, that they have packed up and left their homes. Although we were advised heavily against blood testing by the defence department we are now discovering that many of us have very high levels of PFOS and PFOA. I am furious at how the Department of Defence ※manages§ us as a problem it seems determined to pass on to someone else and not accept responsibility. Adding to that, they now want to expand the Williamtown RAAF base to lengthen the runway for their latest fighter planes. At a time when those of us living in the red zone are facing financial uncertainty and an inability to sell or mortgage properties, the polluter has no problem getting approval to expand as far as it needs. Works have continued on the base, adding insult to the losses sustained to community businesses and homes. We are repeatedly told the NSW Environmental Protection Authority has no jurisdiction over the defence department. This has left us feeling like we have no one to stand up for us; that the defence department is more important than us. We are not a wealthy community at Williamtown and Salt Ash, but we are a strong community. We understand that we are up against a vast and inflexible bureaucracy in the defence department. However, we have no choice. We live and work here in the red zone and we will fight until we get the defence department to clean up the mess it created.

"Just below the surface of the turquoise sea, coral flutters majestically amid schools of puffed up porcupinefish and fluorescent blue and yellow angelfish.The gangly staghorn and fanning elkhorn corals are thriving in swimming distance of Laughing Bird Caye, a tiny Caribbean sandy islet in southern , thanks to a restoration project that is yielding striking results.More than 90,000 corals grown in sea nurseries have been planted in shallow reefs, increasing coral cover in these southern warm waters by 35%. Marine creatures are reproducing, and about 90% have survived natural and manmade pressures for almost a decade.Hailed as the most impressive coral reef restoration effort in the Caribbean, its success is linked to a grassroots movement uniting fisherman, tour guides, scientists and environmentalists working to conserve the 700-mile Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) 每 the second largest barrier reef in the world.

At more than 300 sites in Mexico, , Honduras and Guatemala, scientists measure coral cover, fish stocks and fleshy macroalgae 每 a nuisance seaweed which competes for space with coral.And despite the huge threats posed by pollution and climate change, a forthcoming HRI report will reveal steady improvements in the overall health of the MAR.  cover has risen from 10% to 17.5% since 2006 每 far from great, but much healthier than many other reefs.※This is a David versus Goliath battle in which we haven＊t yet been squashed,§ said HRI founder Melanie McField with the Smithsonian Institution. ※Working at a targeted local and regional level has helped the MAR hold its own and withstand major threats outside our control.§But the HRI report, to be published next month, also reveals challenges threatening the reef. In particular, fleshy macroalgae is flourishing at the expense of coral due to rising contamination and dwindling fish stocks.In Belize 每 once regarded as a visionary in marine management 每 the reef is threatened by hotel resorts, inadequate law enforcement and oil extraction.Unesco declared Belize＊s barrier reef system a World Heritage site in 1996. Its diverse ecosystem hosts more than a thousand low-lying islands, the Blue Hole 每  每 and 1,400 species of flora and fauna.Conservation is crucial for this tiny central American country, as around half the population, or 180,000 people, depend on tourism from diving, snorkelling and fishing. The reef generates around 15% of Belize＊s GDP.But the unbridled sell-off of cayes within so-called marine protected areas, the destruction of mangroves, overfishing and agricultural runoffs have seriously damaged the Belize reef, which has been on the world heritage danger list since 2009.Laughing Bird Caye lies 12 miles from the southern tip of the scenic Placencia Peninsula, a long land strip which snakes between the sea and a huge lagoon. The vistas, however, are blighted by densely packed hotels, holiday homes, and half-built lodgings abandoned when foreign investment ran dry. Visitor numbers have surged in recent years, and the toilets on Laughing Bird Caye cannot always cope, so human waste spills into the sea.※In a marine protected area in a world heritage site; surely waste management should be a priority,§ said marine biologist Lisa Carne from Fragments of Hope, which leads the coral restoration project.A couple of miles south of the peninsula is Harvest Caye, an island sold to a Norwegian cruise line company which drops off thousands of passengers every month.The sale went through despite the government＊s own guidelines warning against megaprojects in the area. . The supreme court ruled that the environmental impact assessment was flawed and community consultations inadequate. The ruling set an important legal precedent 每 but came too late to stop the cruise island. According to Nadia Bood, the World  Fund＊s reef scientist in Belize, too many tourism projects are approved contrary to environmental regulations.※We＊ve got some good laws, which aren＊t implemented, and some very outdated ones, where fines for infractions are too low, and there is too much self-monitoring ＃to protect the Belize reef system the current development pattern has to change,§ she said.Non-compliance is a recurring theme: in 2009, Belize was praised for laws designed to tackle overfishing. These created no-take and no-fishing zones in biodiversity hot spots and a complete ban on fishing grazers like the brilliantly coloured parrotfish. Grazers eat the fleshy macroalgae, so when numbers decline, so does coral cover.But the law is not universally enforced.The central section of the Belize reef is the only MAR zone rated ※critical§ by HRI, largely on account of dangerously low fish stocks. In the southern reef, which includes Laughing Bird Caye, commercial and grazer fish stocks are twice the regional average as no-fishing rules are better enforced.But environmentalists fear that Placencia Peninsula is repeating mistakes made on San Pedro town on Ambergris Caye 每 widely regarded as an example of how not to develop.Reached by ferry from Belize City, San Pedro has morphed from a sleepy fishing village into the country＊s most popular tourist destination where holidaymakers descend to dive, snorkel, fly fish and party. There are no cars on the island, but the grumble of golf buggies is loud and constant.Visitors produce too much rubbish and waste for the island＊s inadequate infrastructure to handle. Consequently, a third of the reef here is covered in fleshy macroalgae 每 the worst rate in the MAR; cover coral is only 12%.San Pedro also illustrates another dangerous consequence of unchecked development: mangrove destruction.Mangroves, coastline woody shrubs and miniature trees, are complex ecosystems in their own right and vital for healthy reefs. The long snaky roots support and buffer sandy shores, and act as giant nurseries for young fish.Almost no mangroves remain around San Pedro as developers cull the amphibious forests to leave sandy beaches. The island is fenced by artificial sea walls, rebuilt increasingly higher to try shield it from big waves.New regulations promised in March to restrict mangrove clearance on private and public lands promised have yet to appear.※Development has gone way beyond the island＊s capacity,§ said Billy Leslie, president of national tour guides association. ※The government either doesn＊t have the right experts, or the experts are telling them what they want to hear.§The MAR last suffered a major bleaching event in 1998, but it remains a constant threat. In addition, a new, potentially catastrophic threat hovers over Belize: oil.In 2015, leaked documents revealed that offshore oil exploration licences affecting several marine protected areas were secretly issued a few years earlier.The government subsequently promised to introduce a ban protecting the Unesco site and a 1km buffer around the reef, a proposal widely derided as unworkable given it would only cover a seventh of the sea. The closest clean-up equipment in Jamaica would take three days to reach an oil spill here.But even this half-hearted ban hasn＊t been implemented; the temporary moratorium could be lifted at any moment.※Oil and healthy reefs are not compatible,§ said McField from HRI. ※A spill would be an onslaught on conservation and restoration efforts, the risk is so not worth it.§ "																																																			
																																																			
"In our village, we have seen both the potential and the limitations of people-led efforts to tackle litter (, 13 July). The parish council and the local transition village group have worked together to both inform people about the wider environmental problems of litter, especially plastic, and to develop a network of individuals who have undertaken to keep specific roads or areas free of litter. Volunteers were provided with good-quality litter pickers (available from the Keep Britain Tidy campaign) and gloves, and a map was put up in the parish office showing the areas covered.The results have been fantastic: lots of volunteers mean that most of the village is litter-free most of the time. I am sure that Wendy Harvey＊s hope that the sight of people picking up litter raises awareness and discourages (but doesn＊t stop) others from dropping litter. A campaign at the local secondary school, has undoubtedly contributed as well.However, the village has two major arteries running through its outskirts 每 the tidal River Avon near its meeting with the Severn, and the A369 between Bristol and Portishead. Both bring in huge amounts of litter which our campaign hasn＊t really touched, despite organised litter picks by groups of local people, and the huge popularity of a local nature reserve that borders a significant section of the A369. I＊m convinced that more communities could follow our example, with great benefits in so many ways. But let＊s not pretend that it would crack the problem: we need action by the government (eg a deposit system for plastic bottles) and by retailers, who should be doing much more to reduce the vast and unnecessary amounts of packaging 每 mainly plastic and not all recyclable 每 they use. A campaign called ※§ already exists as a network and was started in Marseilles in 2015 by Edmund Platt, a Leeds-born man. His idea was to encourage everyone to pick up at least one piece of rubbish every day and put it into the nearest bin.Since January 2016, I have been following his example. Using my free bus pass, I travel all over England and , of the rubbish I＊ve collected, in an attempt to encourage others to follow suit. Picking up a piece of rubbish is an activity that costs nothing, it＊s in the fresh air, it＊s a little bit of exercise and it＊s guaranteed to make you feel empowered to make a difference! Like your letter writer Wendy Harvey, I feel sure that, with more publicity (maybe the Guardian could champion this cause?) and the sharing of information, this campaign could flourish into a national habit and make a hugely positive impact on our environment. United, together we can make our country beautiful again. I actively pick up litter on my daily dog walks (including other people＊s dogs＊ poo) around the streets and parks where I live. However, I strongly believe that as a society someone needs to take a policy lead in our attitudes to the environment in which we all live. I have no doubt I was influenced by the Keep Britain Tidy campaigns in the 1960s and 70s. Now more than ever we need quirky, funny public information campaigns to counter the selfish throwaway culture. Environmental NGOs need to be encouraged to take on government and big business on plastic bottles and cans fouling our parks and rivers. How about emulating a lot of states in the US who charge a tiny deposit (say 5p)? Wendy Harvey＊s suggestion that we all commit to doing our own little bit to tackle the current deluge of litter deserves our support, but perhaps a sensible start would be to re-employ and pay a decent wage to the thousands of road sweepers and litter pickers laid off in the name of austerity in recent years. I like the idea of a campaign to promote litter-collecting. But please, no stickers or badges. The world is suffocating under a sea of pointless plastic toys and ※promotional§ freebies made in China that probably don＊t even get recycled but end up in landfill. For the same reason, can we ban children＊s party bags? Well said, Wendy Harvey. Here in my?home town I have been doing exactly that every day for several years on my short walk around the corner to collect my Guardian. Add other initiatives such?as hedge- and verge-trimming, snow-clearance and path-sweeping, and we may begin to restore the concept of civic pride once far more prevalent in our communities. When asked why I do it, my usual response is to quote Voltaire 每 ※pour encourager les autres§. I am pleased to report that it is beginning to have some effect. I totally agree with Wendy Harvey that there should be a sensible national programme to eliminate litter from our streets by people being encouraged to always pick up and bin one piece of litter every time they go out. She asked for a slogan to spearhead the campaign. How about: ※This is your country, why make it a mess?§ The problem in the past has been that previous campaigns have been too lily-livered about emphasising the personal involvement in one＊s own environment which is required to get rid of litter. Nowadays one has to shout to make people take notice, even in their own interest."																																																			
" was in fine fettle last week. The last of its population of puffins had departed for the winter a few weeks earlier, while its thousands of young gannets were still being cared for by their parents on the chalk cliffs of the East Yorkshire nature site. For good measure, kittiwakes, cormorants and fulmars were also bathing in the sunshine.It was a comforting sight for any birdwatcher but this benign picture was in stark contrast to many other bird reserves in Britain. Our populations of seabirds 每 arctic skuas, arctic terns and kittiwakes 每 are in freefall. And, in some cases, the numbers are dire.※For reasons that are not entirely clear 每 though they are almost certainly concerned with climate change 每  has not suffered from the precipitous declines in seabird numbers that we see elsewhere,§ said Euan Dunn, a principal policy officer for the RSPB.※Our seabird colonies, especially those in northern Scotland, are withering away. At the same time, the government has displayed a complete dereliction of duty in failing to properly track this calamity. In particular, it has ignored calls to carry out its statutory duty to organise a comprehensive national census of our seabirds, even though one is long overdue. That would at least reveal the extent of the crisis and help highlight possible solutions.§One example of the devastating losses is found on , one of the most significant seabird colonies in the North Atlantic. On this rocky outpost, there has been a 99% reduction in kittiwake nests since 1990. Last year only one pair bred in all the monitored sites on the island, and that single chick died. Yet in the middle of the last century these distinctive dark-eyed gulls thrived across the island. In addition, the kittiwake colony at Marwick Head on Orkney was once a noisy, bustling home to thousands of kittiwakes but is today deserted.Similarly, Fair Isle puffins, with their large pale cheeks and brightly-coloured bills, have dropped in numbers from 20,000 to 10,000 over the past 30 years, while on Orkney and Shetland guillemots have also halved in number with several colonies disappearing. Fulmars, arctic skuas and arctic terns have also suffered massive losses. Added together, these statistics indicate that, in the past 25 years, Scotland may have lost almost half its breeding seabird population.A catastrophe is unfolding. The UK is an internationally important site for seabirds, is home to most of the world＊s Manx shearwaters, gannets and great skuas, and has significant colonies of many other key seabirds such as the Atlantic puffin. Yet the government has resolutely declined to fund a new national census in the wake of those organised in 1970, 1985 and 2000 and which it is supposed to instigate every 15 years.※It＊s a lamentable failure of government not to have given its statutory nature conservation agencies the resources necessary to carry out a coordinated comprehensive national census of our seabird colonies,§ said Dunn.When the first national census 每known as  at the time 每 was completed in 1970, populations of seabirds appeared fairly healthy, as did those that were counted for the second national census in 1989. However, the census of 2000 produced worrying evidence that declines were taking place. ※Things have got much worse since then. We are supposed to have a national census every 15 years but now that is slipping towards 20 years 每 just at a time when populations of so many seabirds are clearly in freefall,§ said Dunn.※We desperately need to have an accurate assessment of what is going on, a census that will pinpoint the varying fortunes of all our colonies and which will tell us where we may need to bolster particular sites and build resilience.※We may need to establish marine protected areas offshore or take action to rid an island of rats. But until we have the whole picture, which only a comprehensive census can provide, we cannot work out where to deploy our resources.§As to the possible causes of the dramatic decline in seabird populations, most experts point to the waters around the  thanks to global warming caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions. In the wake of this change, seas have also seen a dramatic loss of zooplankton while, further up the food chain, sand eels 每 a critically important source of food for many birds 每 have disappeared from many parts of the Atlantic and the North Sea. As a result, seabirds such as terns and kittiwakes 每 which only take sand eels from the sea surface 每 are doing far worse than birds such as razorbills, which take fish from greater depths.※The trouble is that climate change is only going to worsen,§ said Dunn. ※We desperately need to do something to give our seabirds a fighting chance of survival in future. The very least we can expect to achieve that is a proper census every 15 years.§"																																																			
"It＊s great to see that you are highlighting plastic waste. I have developed an engineering day for schoolchildren in which they learn about the life cycle of a bottle of shampoo, which I deliver to schools throughout the north-east of England. It demonstrates where plastic comes from (crude oil), and also considers how it is disposed of.I raise a major concern with students that, for their future, they need to: ensure they recycle and reuse as much as possible; look for alternatives to using plastic packaging etc; and consider careers in science and engineering which will allow them to work on issues caused by overuse of plastic that will arise in their lifetime.It is so important to educate young people on this. I know a lot of campaigns are aimed at adults, and they should continue. But I would like to see more work in schools.I live in Campinas, Brazil where drinking water is readily available and of good quality until it leaves the various plants. The pipes in the delivery system are in bad shape and most people buy water for drinking and use tap water for other tasks.In many developing countries, we are well provided with recyclers who collect and then sell everything they garner from the street as an income. The best and most illustrative example of recycling plastic bottles was the year the city council collected undamaged bottles, and separated them by colour. They then made Christmas decorations for the whole city. Many, many bottles were used and it worked 每 20-metre-tall Christmas trees were built, and parks and squares throughout the city were decorated.This hasn＊t, however, been repeated. I think many of the wealthy in the city were far from happy having garbage decorating the streets.The Guardian is doing a good job bringing the issue of plastic bottles to more public attention. Many don＊t give it any thought, thinking that disposing of the odd bottle carelessly does not matter. Far more widespread public information and campaigning is needed. As well as recycling my own bottles, I have added my name to campaigns by 38 Degrees, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. In addition to lobbying governments, we need to pressure manufacturers to use alternatives. These might include: Refill packs. Waxed card [packaging] could be used extensively, from which consumers can refill their plastic bottles at home. This would cover many products from detergents to shampoo. In fact, many products would be fine in these anyway. Using the type with a plastic screw top would still be a big improvement, and easier to open. Waxed packaging can also be recycled. A related issue is the pump-action trigger pack. A screw-on assembly would make refills possible. The moulded-on assembly used by many manufacturers prevents such refills. It also makes recycling very difficult because plastic bottles going to recycling should be rinsed out. Manufacturers should be legally obliged to put a large notice on the front of their bottles to say what proportion of recycled plastic has been used. Many commenters on the Bottling It articles have highlighted the widespread use of recycling machines in continental supermarkets, which should be adopted in the UK. You put your empty bottle in, and get a money-off coupon for your next purchase. We should have separate public litter bins for glass and plastics. No doubt cash-strapped local authorities would struggle to afford them; an enlightened government would pay for the actual bins. An international clean-up is needed. There should be a compulsory levy on large manufacturers. Some types of machinery to collect from the surface of open oceans have already been proposed.I belong to a group of mostly retired people called the  who volunteer in association with the David Suzuki Foundation in Vancouver, Canada. We are concerned about living in a sustainable fashion and protecting our environment from further degradation. Most of us were born before plastic became widely available, and yes, life was just as satisfying when we didn＊t throw millions of tons of plastic into our oceans each year. The Suzuki Elders support limiting the purchase and use of disposable plastics, and one of our educational programmes 每 directed at children and called ※Playing without Plastic§ 每 is another step in the right direction.The majority of plastic bottles are binned fully formed, taking up a huge amount of space: the volume of a typical plastic bottle is 500ml and a flattened one only 70ml. An empty plastic bottle can be reduced in volume in a number of ways: flattened, twisted, crushed and mechanically chewed to pieces. The technology for doing all of these things is basic and familiar engineering and I am sure that there would be a place for portable devices. Reducing the volume of bottles would make the gathering, transport and processing of plastic detritus much more efficient.On a final note: why not have a design competition and see what solutions are offered? I think the Bottling It initiative is great. In developed countries which can afford and enforce regulation, I believe the approach adopted for plastic bags and incandescent lightbulbs should be considered for water and drinks plastic bottles. This might mean, for instance, putting a fixed fee on all plastic bottles (unless they＊re recycled), and gradually forbidding by law all plastic bottles smaller than 1.5 litres.From a consumer＊s perspective we should stop buying bottled water! Tap water is safe in developed countries, and drinking water treatment plants aren＊t less regulated and controlled than bottled water companies. If you live in a place where you know for sure tap water isn＊t safe, like the Democratic Republic of the Congo where I live, consumers should buy large bottles of water (eg 5 litres and above), or go for a water cooler/dispenser.Could a solution be a Cost to the Community Tax (CCT) on all plastics? The CCT would be pretty hefty if the costs of plastic pollution are as great as you and Greenpeace state. This would both bring in big revenues to pay for long overdue clean-up operations and also start to suppress demand for plastic packaging, which would become more expensive than less environmentally damaging types of packaging.As long as plastic is cheap to use and neither producers nor consumers pay for post-consumption costs to the community, including damage to the ecosystem, I cannot see how or why people will change their behaviour. Here in Germany all liquids sold in plastic bottles include extra for the bottle. At the next visit all plastic bottles are returned as is the deposit. As a consequence, there are no plastic bottles lying around as all are reused/recycled.We should adopt a Robin Hood approach to plastic bottles:The 5p charge on plastic shopping bags saw usage plummet. Cost is a great driver.I have worked in relief and development for many years and the Bottling It series struck a chord. One of the most difficult aspects of relief work is supplying clean water to affected communities rapidly. In the past, bottled water has been used extensively and to a large extent it still is.It has a number of advantages:However, the drawbacks are not insignificant:To get around this, organisations such as Unicef and the World Food Programme (and NGOs and others) try to move in water purification equipment as soon as possible. Some programmes who front-load bottled water will accept the bottles for refilling from the purification equipment, but this is only haphazardly implemented.I＊m just back from Norway where I saw a chilling exhibition in Bergen＊s Cultural History Museum  that was found dying in a fjord at Sotra. When scientists opened the whale＊s stomach, they found it full of plastic debris that had blocked its digestive system: bags, bottles, and more. There has been a huge campaign to recycle promoted at all the fisheries museums in Norway, but most of the plastic bags found in the whale＊s stomach had English text on them.And then I was given two plastic cups on the flight home ..."																																																			
																																																			
"That was  when  revealed that while it was at the forefront of climate science research in the 1970s and 1980s, Harvard scientists  and  decided to take up Exxon＊s challenge, and have  in the journal Environmental Research Letters. They used a method known as  to analyze 187 public and internal Exxon documents. The results are striking:As Oreskes documented with Erik Conway in , tobacco companies and several other industries that profited from harmful products engaged in decades-long campaigns to sow doubt about the scientific evidence of their hazards. As one R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company  read:The results of this new paper show that Exxon followed this same playbook. While the company＊s internal communications and peer-reviewed research were clear about human-caused global warming, its public communications focused heavily on sowing doubt about those scientific conclusions.For example, Exxon scientist Brian Flannery co-authored a chapter of a  with NYU professor Martin Hoffert concluding that in a ※Low CO2§ emissions scenario, humans would cause about 2∼C global surface warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100, and about 5∼C in a ※High CO2§ scenario. These projections were in close agreement with  nearly 30 years later.Yet in  in the New York Times opposing , Exxon argued:The advertorial included a misleading graph showing that human activities only account for 3每4% of global carbon dioxide emissions 每 misleading because the . Earth naturally releases a lot of carbon, but absorbs just as much. Human emissions disrupt that balance and hence are responsible for the entire increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels:In  to raise doubts about a National Research Council climate report, Exxon talked about:That advertorial included  often used by climate deniers because it gives the appearance that current temperatures are lower than they have been over most of the past millennium. The chart is misleading for two reasons:  is one isolated geographic area that doesn＊t accurately represent the entire planet, and the data shown on the graph ends roughly a century ago, excluding most human-caused global warming.Crucially, Exxon＊s own climate science research answered these questions 10每20 years before the company published the misleading advertorials. The scientific evidence clearly indicated that by burning fossil fuels like those sold by Exxon, humans were increasing carbon dioxide levels, which were causing global warming, and that this would continue until we stop adding more carbon pollution to the atmosphere.These were the conclusions of 80% of Exxon＊s peer-reviewed research and internal communications, and yet 80% of its advertorials aimed at the public were filled with expressions of doubt and misleading statements and charts that would make today＊s climate deniers proud. Doubt was their product, and .This study comes as ExxonMobil already faces numerous investigations by state attorneys general and class action lawsuits. One lawsuit  and inflating its stock value by making false statements about the value of its oil reserves (much of which ), and about how climate policies will impact the company＊s finances.The  for potentially violating the territory＊s anti-racketeering law.  whether Exxon lied to the public and its shareholders about the risks of climate change and the potential effects on the company＊s finances. Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey is  to determine whether Exxon deceived the public and investors about climate change risks.By showing that Exxon systematically misled the public by following the tobacco industry playbook, the new Harvard study will undoubtedly bolster these cases.In its defense, Exxon spokespeople have asserted that the company didn＊t  or  its climate science research. While that＊s generally true, it＊s also true that Exxon＊s public statements painted a very different picture about our understanding of human-caused global warming than the company＊s scientific research and internal communications. The vast majority of those paid statements were aimed at manufacturing doubt, and often included the same misleading myths and charts that can be found on any run-of-the-mill climate denial blog.Exxon＊s scientists published some valuable climate research. Company officials discussed those findings internally. But in its public communications, Exxon officials decided to follow the tobacco industry playbook 每 claim that the science remains unsettled in order to undermine regulations and prevent a decline in public consumption of their dangerous products.The tobacco industry was eventually . Considering the findings of this new study, ExxonMobil may face a similar fate."																																																			
																																																			
"Greater emissions reductions and delivering on the  are now ※the only opportunity§ to save coral reefs the world over from decline, with local responses no longer sufficient, a report by Unesco has found.The of the impacts of climate change on the 29 world heritage-listed coral reefs, published on Saturday, found that the frequency, intensity and duration of heat-stress events had worsened with increasing global warming, with massive consequences for the 29 world heritage sites.Analysis of recent studies and newly-developed data from the US national ocean and atmospheric administration (NOAA) coral-reef watch showed that 13 of the 29 listed reefs had been exposed to levels of heat stress that cause coral bleaching, on average more than twice per decade from 1985 to 2013.Bleaching had occurred more frequently in recent years than in decades prior, with coral mortality during the third global bleaching event from mid-2014 to mid-2017 ※among the worst ever recorded§. Twenty-one listed sites had suffered severe and/or repeated heat stress in the last three years.Compounding the devastating impact of bleaching 每 which can take coral communities at least 15 to 25 years to recover from 每 were more frequent and more severe extreme weather events, increasing ocean acidification, and pollution.The , ※one of the world＊s most iconic coral reef systems§ and among four of the total 29 listed located in Australia, had been ※seriously affected§ by back-to-back severe bleaching events this year and last, despite considerable investment in efforts to build resilience.Professor Terry Hughes, director of the Australian Research Council centre of excellence for coral reef studies in Townsville, provided an analysis of bleaching records for the report. ※It basically makes the point that everywhere is bleaching,§ he said. ※It＊s certainly not a phenomenon only on the Great Barrier Reef.§Australia＊s scientific community had appealed to the UN world heritage committee to list the Great Barrier Reef . Hughes said this was ※not on the current agenda§, as the committee awaited the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority＊s third outlook report due in 2019.The Unesco report found that local efforts to increase reefs＊ resilience ※remain necessary but are no longer sufficient§ without complementary national and international efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels 每 the most ambitious target set by the Paris agreement, and understood to be the maximum possible to secure coral reefs＊ long-term survival.※We need all of the above,§ said Jon Day, a former director with the Great Barrier marine park authority, now at James Cook University. ※We can＊t just assume local responses are enough, and they must be augmented by global＊s efforts too.§He said while the world heritage convention aimed to ※transmit the world heritage values§ of listed sites for future generations, a natural system would inevitably change with time. ※The question is what is acceptable change, and the reported levels of coral bleaching and coral mortality can hardly be considered by anyone to be acceptable.§The report found that, if emissions were to follow their current trajectory and not decline 每 similar to a ※business-as-usual scenario§ 每 25 of the 29 world heritage reefs (68%) would suffer severe bleaching twice per decade by 2040, rapidly killing most corals present and preventing successful reproduction necessary for their recovery.Reducing emissions so that they peak around 2040 and then decline would reduce that number of affected sites to 14 (48%), and allow an extra 12 years, on average, for them to recover. Hughes said the prospects of coral reefs＊ long-term survival was at a crossroads, with the worst-case scenario able to be avoided only ※if we quickly adopt the 1.5C target§. ※1.5C or 2C degrees won＊t be a particularly comfortable place for reefs 每 they will still see quite regular bleaching and they will be different to how they were 15 or 20 years ago 每 but they will be able to survive.§He said he was optimistic about reefs＊ prospects, given that the business-as-usual path was looking ※increasingly unlikely§ as cities and states the world over moved to exceed federal or commonwealth commitments to curbing emissions.A draft decision prepared by Unesco, to be addressed by the world heritage committee at its meeting in Krakow in Poland from 2 to 12 July,  were of ※utmost concern§.But Day said it was ※very disappointing§ that the draft decision only committed to further studies at this stage: ※How much evidence do they need?§"																																																			
"For Beijing＊s residents, this winter brought a sense of deja vu: flights grounded by smog, air quality ※red alerts§ and pronouncements on the city＊s latest efforts to fight air pollution.In January and February the average amount of PM2.5 每 fine particles small enough to pass from the lungs to other organs 每 was  95 micrograms per cubic metre: up 70% from the same period in 2016.Walking the capital＊s streets it doesn＊t feel, or smell, like the  that China declared in 2014 is being won.Yet environmental academics say data taken over a wider time scale shows air quality is improving over the longer-term 每 partly thanks to tougher action on polluting business, particularly factories and construction sites.In February the Beijing government announced a year on year 23% hike to its environmental protection and energy efficiency budget, taking it to 33.8bn yuan (?4bn). Of this, more than half is earmarked for improving air quality.The city＊s environmental protection bureau handed out fines totalling 183m yuan (?21.5m) for pollution law violations in 2015, . Beijing＊s municipal government has also stepped up spot checks on polluters, with 170 companies on a watch list requiring them to have daily inspections, according to  at the end of last year.The ramp-up in part reflects the greater teeth given to environment officials by China＊s updated environmental protection law,  for the first time in a quarter of a century in 2014.The law gives them power to detain company bosses who don＊t complete environmental impact assessments and removes limits on fines for firms that breach pollution quotas. Earlier this month, Chinese media  the detention of a Beijing-based heating company worker for allowing pollutants to be released from his workplace.※The penalties are harsh and implementation [in Beijing] isn＊t as hard to do as it is elsewhere,§ says Angel Hsu, assistant professor of environmental studies at Yale-NUS College. Away from the capital, and the heart of state power, officials are more likely to prioritise local development over national policy directives on the environment, she says.The capital＊s pollution figures support the view that the business crackdowns, along with measures such as removing coal-fired power plants from the city and , are driving up air quality.In 2016 the average density of PM2.5 was around 73 micrograms per cubic metre in Beijing, according to municipal government figures  by state media. That marked a 9.9% improvement on 2015 PM2.5 figures, themselves down on 2014, officials said.Convincing Beijingers that they are breathing cleaner air is not easy, however, not least because official Chinese statistics on air pollution should be . Beijing＊s ※airpocalypse§ year of 2013, which saw the  (the top end of the scale is supposed to be 500), caused a spike in public awareness of the issue 每 reinforced by the recent red alerts.※Improvement is hard to see when your kids are walking around in smog,§ says Anthony Liu, a former Beijing resident now working as assistant professor at Indiana University Bloomington＊s School of Environmental and Public Affairs. ※But, actually, over the past decade Beijing pollution has cleaned up a lot [...] things are turning around slowly, like a battleship.※While all of us would all like to see clear skies in Beijing immediately, it＊s important to be patient as  tightens up its environmental policy,§ adds Liu.Beijing＊s mayor Cai Qi has  for average PM2.5 levels of 60 micrograms per cubic metre for the year, down from 2016＊s figure of around 73. However, that PM2.5 figure needs to fall below 50 micrograms for Beijing＊s air quality to be recognised as ※good§ by the ministry of environmental protection.※The pollution level will gradually improve, as the overall average figures show,§ insists Dabo Guan, professor in climate change economics at the University of East Anglia, who believes Beijing will be one of the first large Chinese cities to tackle air pollution thoroughly. However, Guan believes Beijing＊s eventual success may come at a cost for other parts of China as they take up more of the industrial strain. ※Other places in China will suffer air pollution much longer than Beijing does,§ he says. ※I always say to my wife: ＆If you want to go back to China one day, it＊s Beijing＊.§"																																																			
"t could have been the edge of the Sahara or even Death Valley, but it was the remains of a large orchard in the hills above the city of  in southern Spain last year. The soil had broken down into fine white, lifeless sand, and a landscape of rock and dying orange and lemon trees stretched into the distance.A long drought, the second in a few years, had devastated the harvest after city authorities had  and farmers were protesting in the street. It was a foretaste of what may happen if temperatures in the Mediterranean basin continue to rise and desertification grows.All round the world, farmers, city authorities and scientists have observed changing patterns of rainfall, temperature rises and floods. Fifteen of the 16 hottest years have been recorded since 2000. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions steadily climb. Oceans are warming and glaciers, ice caps and sea ice are melting faster than expected. Meanwhile, heat and rainfall records tumble. The evidence for the onset of climate change is compelling. But who and where is it hitting the hardest? How fast will it come to , or the US? What will be its impact on tropical cities, forests or farming? On the poor, or the old? When it comes to details, much is uncertain.Mapping the world＊s climate hotspots and identifying where the impacts will be the greatest is increasingly important for governments, advocacy groups and others who need to prioritise resources, set goals and adapt to a warming world.But lack of data and different priorities make it hard. Should scientists pinpoint the places most likely to see faster than average warming or wetter winters, or should they combine expected physical changes with countries＊ vulnerability? Some hot-spot models use population data. Others seek to portray the impacts of a warming world on water resources or megacities. Global bodies want to know how climate might exacerbate natural hazards like floods and droughts. Economists want to know its impacts on resources. Charities want to know how it will affect women or the poorest. What follows is a subjective appraisal of the seven most important climate hotspots, based on analysis of numerous scientific models and personal experience of observing climate change in a variety of places. Delta regions, semi-arid countries, and glacier- and snowpack-dependent river basins are all in the frontline. But so, too, are tropical coastal regions and some of the world＊s greatest forests and cities. For Wolfgang Cramer, scientific director of the Mediterranean Institute for Biodiversity and Ecology in Aix-en-Provence, France, climate change impacts are already visible not only in the vicinity of Murcia, but across much of the Mediterranean basin. If pledges to cut emissions are not met, catastrophe looms. He and his colleague Joel Guiot, a paleoclimatologist, last year  over the past 10,000 years and compared them with projections about climate and vegetation from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If warming is allowed to rise to 2C, the scientists concluded, much of southern  and the Mediterranean basin could become desert. Their paper, published in Science, was shocking because it showed that even a small temperature increase could be enough to create ecological havoc in a very heavily populated region with relatively wealthy countries.They warned that North African countries would see increased temperatures and drought that would drive the southern deserts further north; that deserts would expand in the Middle East, pushing temperate forests higher into the mountains; and that ecosystems not seen in the Mediterranean basin in more than 10,000 years could develop.※We are more certain of the drying trend in the region than almost anywhere else on the planet. Temperatures have risen 1C globally but 1.4C in the Mediterranean region. The trend is for it to become ever warmer,§ says Cramer.Increasing temperature, he says, drives droughts. ※More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means rising temperatures, less precipitation and then more drying that leads to desertification.§Meanwhile, water stress, heat waves and an extended drought linked to climate change in the eastern Mediterranean has been widely implicated in the long Syrian war and an underlying driver of conflict in Middle East and North African countries. The World Resources Institute concurred in 2015 that the Mediterranean basin was a climate hotspot when it placed 14 of the world＊s 33 most . ※Drought and water shortages in Syria likely contributed to the unrest that stoked the country＊s 2011 civil war. Dwindling water resources and chronic mismanagement forced 1.5 million people, primarily farmers and herders, to lose their livelihoods and leave their land, move to urban areas, and magnify Syria＊s general destabilisation,§ it said. The fast-growing, heavily populated region is climatically vulnerable, it concluded. The food supplies and the social balance of places like Palestine, , Algeria, Lebanon and Jordan are all highly sensitive to even a small change in water supplies. As climate change intensifies, communities face grave threats from both droughts and floods. The combined impact of many more people, higher temperatures and changing weather patterns on the region＊s already scarce freshwater resources poses further potential for conflict. But optimists hope it could force compromise between competing states and water users. Rural areas already have no option but to switch to more efficient irrigation systems and drought tolerant crops, and urban areas are learning to conserve water. I met Honufa soon after she arrived in Dhaka 10 years ago. Erosion and saltwater intrusion on her family＊s land on one of the low-lying islands in the mouth of the Ganges River had forced the young Bangladeshi woman to leave her village for the capital. She had taken a boat and then an overnight bus and ended up in a slum called Beribadh.Honufa is a climate refugee, one of thousands who have struggled to grow their crops. Millions are likely to follow her if current trends continue.※In the next 20 years we would expect five to 10 million people to have to move from the coastal areas,§ says Saleemul Huq, director of the Bangladesh-based . ※The whole country is a climate hotspot, but the most vulnerable area is the coast. Dhaka is the place where people head to,§ he says. Huq, who has advised the Bangladesh government at successive UN climate summits, says there is strong evidence that climate change is now impacting Dhaka. ※Temperatures have already gone up by 1C. We can see that the weather patterns have changed. Ask anyone in the street, and they will say the frequency of floods has changed. Bangladesh has a long history of floods, but what used to be a one-in-20-year event now happens one year in five. It is what we would expect with climate change models.§Huq and other Bangladeshi climate scientists expect to see more extremes. ※Changing rain patterns suggest we will not get more rain over the coming years but it will be distributed differently, with less in the dry season and more during the monsoons. Paradoxically, this will lead to more floods and droughts, and heavier monsoons,§ he says. ※We are beginning to see sea levels rising and increased salinity in coastal areas. It is a slow onset, which will get worse. It is a climate change phenomenon and not something we had before.§Huq leads research into how Bangladesh can adapt to climate change. ※We＊ve done a lot of research looking at the most vulnerable hotspots. We are learning by doing,§ he says. ※Government has now invested in a major climate change action plan. To counter coastal salinity there is a big program of rainwater harvesting and coastal protection. Scientists are developing saline-tolerant rice. People and government are proactive. ※The trouble is that we are always catching up with the problem. There is a limit to what we can grow. At some point we will run out of options, then people will have to move. We know that if we don＊t take action people will all end up in Dhaka, so [we] need to invest in other towns and cities.§Late last year, the temperature in southern Malawi in southern Africa rose to more than 46C. A long regional drought crossing Zimbabwe, Zambia, Madagascar and Tanzania had scorched and killed the staple maize crop and  depended on food aid. Long-term climate data in southern Africa is sparse, but studies backed by oral evidence from villagers confirm the region is a climate hotspot where , and the dry spells and floods are lasting longer. With more than 90% of Malawi and the region depending on rain-fed agriculture, it does not need scientists to tell people that the climate is changing. I sat down with villagers near Nsanje in the south of Malawi.※I know what it is to go hungry,§ says Elvas Munthali, a Malawian aid worker. ※My family depended on farming. The climate is changing. Now we plant maize at the end of December or even January; we used to do that in November.§ Patrick Kamzitu, a health worker in Nambuma, says: ※It is much warmer now. The rains come and we plant but then there is a dry spell. The dry spells and the rains are heavier but shorter.§One of best studies comes from the Chiwawa district near Nsanje, close to the Mozambique border.  by the University of Malawi, backed by 50 years of rainfall and temperature data, established that rains, floods, strong winds, high temperatures and droughts were all becoming more common.The story is more or less repeated across southern Africa and backed by governments and scientific modeling. USAid, the African Development Bank, the World Bank and IPCC assessments suggest  between 1960 and 2006.Looking ahead, scientists expect average annual temperatures across southern Africa to soar, possibly as much as 3C by the 2060s, to 5C by the 2090s 每 a temperature that would render most human life nearly impossible. But estimates vary greatly. Rainfall, says USAid, could decrease in some places by 13% and increase in others by 32%.All African countries know that they must adapt their farming, restore their forests, improve their water supplies and grow their economies quickly to have any chance of surviving climate change. But the adaptation money pledged to these, the world＊s poorest countries, by the rich at successive UN climate summits has barely started to trickle through.Changes could be catastrophic. In North Africa, Egypt could lose 15% of its wheat crop if temperatures increase 2C 每 36% if they rise 4C. Morocco expects crop yields to remain stable up to about 2030, but then to drop quickly afterward.Conversely, a  from the International Food Policy Research Institute expects some farmers to be able to grow more food as temperatures rise and rainfall increases. Climate change may mean Nigeria, Ghana and Togo can grow and export more sorghum, raised for grain.But most African countries are extremely vulnerable to climate change and have no reason to expect it will improve their lot. Instead of waiting for western money, they are pressing ahead where they can with water conservation, tree planting and small-scale irrigation schemes.  and flood resistant crops are being adopted by the few, but the odds of more severe droughts and floods are high and the resources to resist them are slim.The temperature in Longyearbyen on the Svalbard archipelago about 650 miles from the North Pole, averaged about  in April. If that sounds cold, consider that it was nearly 8C warmer than the 30-year average for the time of year, and that April was no outlier. The average temperature for the whole of 2016 in Longyearbyen was . Usually it is 每10C.※No region on the planet is experiencing more dramatic climate change than ,§ says Kim Holm谷n, international director of the , who has lived on and off in Svalbard for 30 years. Although he is unsure precisely why temperatures are rising so fast there, he says, ※make no mistake, there has never been a run of temperatures like this ever recorded.§ Holm谷n works at the Zeppelin research station at Ny-?lesund, where 11 countries study climate change, air quality and ice. ※Water temperatures on Svalbard have increased 10C or more in my time here,§ he says. The fjord, which used to be covered with ice one-metre thick in winter, no longer freezes over. ※We see temperatures changing, snow melting earlier, new species of fish. We are seeing big unexpected changes.§Longyearbyen, home to some 2,100 people, is on borrowed time, Holm谷n says. ※There have been two avalanches there in the last year, both defined as 1,000-year events. These are the types of events we expect to see increasing. A whole part of Longyearbyen may have to be abandoned. ※The changes taking place now will influence [many other places]. The global climate is clearly influenced by the Arctic. There will be ramifications everywhere. We already see more precipitation in northern Scandinavia and low pressure weather systems taking a more northerly route.§Holm谷n is backed by Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation at University College London. I first met her in 2012 on a Greenpeace ship which steamed north from Longyearbyen to within 300 miles of the pole across a sea that would normally be iced over. She spoke from Cambridge Bay in the Canadian high Arctic.※2017 is already setting records,§ she says. ※There was a record low [ice cover] for March this year, so that makes six months in a row with record [or near record] low ice conditions. There are many ways the Arctic is changing. You see it in melt season starting earlier than it used to and taking longer to freeze up, in the melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the Arctic glaciers, the warming of permafrost temperatures, in increased coastal erosion, the northward migration of the tree line and species, and in how local communities can no longer keep their food in the ground because the thaw increased.§ Both Stroeve and Holm谷n are by nature cautious scientists, not given to dramatic statements. But both say they are astonished, even scared, by the speed at which the Arctic changes are happening. ※Given our current emission rates of 35 to 40 gigatons [of carbon dioxide] per year we should see ice-free conditions in September in about 20 years,§ says Stroeve. Longyearbyen residents are getting used to more extreme weather and coming to terms with what it means for them. The town has created a new risk assessment map and an avalanche warning system. Some parts of the town may be deemed unsafe and will have to be moved. Others may be protected by snow fences or walls.※What is happening here is a very obvious case of climate change with consequences for animals, plants and humans,§ says Holm谷n. It is happening across the Arctic much faster than we thought possible, and I expect now to see an ice-free Arctic in 20 or so years.§ When Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil＊s leading climatologists, lived in Manaus in the 1970s, the population was a few hundred thousand and the highest temperature ever recorded in the city had been 33.5C. The city was surrounded by cool, dense forest and the greatest river on Earth. Heat waves were rare and floods regular but manageable. Today Manaus has more than 2 million people, and it and the wider Amazon region are changing fast. In 2015, Nobre says, the temperature in Manaus soared to 38.8C. ※The Amazon is tropical and very hot, but when I lived there the hot spells were rare,§ he says. ※Now we see many more of them.§ Not only that, he says, but dry seasons are longer by a week than they were a decade ago and weather is more erratic. Nobre notes that tree loss is exacerbating the effects of climate change. ※In many parts of continental South America one sees about 1C warming in the Amazon, which can [be] mostly attributed to global warming. In areas like Rond?nia, where there has been widespread deforestation, we see an additional 1C warming due to replacement of forest 每 which is a high-evaporating vegetation 每 to pasture, which is less evaporating.§Hot spells in such a humid climate are a real hazard to health. Yet adaptation to climate change in a teeming, poor city like Manaus is non-existent for the many people who must struggle just to survive. For the middle classes, air conditioning is now essential. The most city authorities can do is plant trees to cool the streets and protect the river banks from flooding.The great uncertainty is how far the drying of the Amazon could affect the rest of the world. ※If you change the rainfall in the Amazon, you could transport the impacts very far away,§ Nobre says. ※According to my calculations, there will be a lot of impacts in southeastern Brazil and also over equatorial Africa and the US. But we cannot pinpoint what will happen.§ Perhaps most ominous is the fact that a positive feedback loop appears to be in play. As the Amazon dries, Nobre says, tropical forest will gradually shift to savanna, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and further adding to global warming.※When we see a dry season of over four months, or deforestation of more than 40%, then there is no way back. Trees will slowly decay, and in 50 years we would see a degraded savanna. It would take 100每200 years to see a fully fledged savanna.§The Amazon then would be unrecognizable, along with much of Earth. New York state may seem an unlikely climate hotspot, but research confirms its status in the top league of potential change. Drawing on the  and research by leading federal agencies and academics, it calculates that temperatures statewide have risen about 1.3C since 1970, spring begins a week sooner than it did just a few decades ago, there is less winter snow and more intense downpours. Meanwhile, sea levels are rising at nearly twice the global rate and birds and fish populations are all moving north.Even more dramatically, the latest scientific projections suggest trouble ahead. By the 2050s, , sea levels could rise nearly 76cm (30 inches), storm surges and flooding will be more common in coastal areas, and West Nile virus and many other diseases could be prevalent.But, says Carl Pope, climate advisor to the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, if climate change is to be addressed, it must be led by big cities like New York, which release nearly 70% of the global emissions but also have the capacity to create solutions.※Cities will always trump countries when it comes to climate change,§ he says. ※Cities are where emissions are. They are mostly consumers of fossil fuels, so they would like to use them as little as possible; they have a natural instinct to save on fossil fuels. Also, they are not very ideological. Improving quality of life is seen as a good.§Mayors, Pope says, are now well ahead of most governments, leading attempts to reduce air pollution which contributes heavily to climate change, and eager to introduce electric cars and renewable energy. ※There is a great public will to improve the quality of life in cities,§ he says. Pope identifies three groups of cities which he thinks will lead others on climate: ※Cities in Nordic countries that will be meticulous about everything. Then there are a few in Latin America and Africa, which will be unbelievably creative. A third group is in east Asia and China, which will do things on a massive scale.§When  struck the city of Tacloban in November 2013, Yeb Sano was the Philippines＊ climate commissioner. He was distraught when I met him. He believed that his brother who lived there had been killed along with many thousands of others. One hour later Sano broke down as he addressed the world＊s diplomats. It was the third super typhoon to hit the Philippines in three years, and five of the 10 strongest typhoons had come in the previous eight years. ※Climate change is real and now,§ he .The Philippines is regularly ranked in lists of the  most affected by climate change. ※We are already experiencing climate change impacts, including sea-level rise, hotter temperatures, extreme weather events and changes in precipitation,§ says Sano, who has now left government to direct Greenpeace SE Asia. ※These in turn, result in human rights impacts, such as loss of homes and livelihoods, water contamination, food scarcity, displacement of whole communities, disease outbreaks, and even the loss of life.§Scientists widely agree that the country, along with nearby Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia, is a hotspot. Analysis of 70 years＊ of government data, , shows a small decrease in the number of smaller typhoons that hit the Philippines each year, but more intense ones. It is not conclusive evidence, but previous studies have suggested the increase may be due to rising sea-surface temperatures since the 1970s.There is no doubt temperatures are rising on land. In Manila and the surrounding metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 12m, the tropical storms are more intense, the floods are more frequent, the nights are hotter and there are fewer cool days, says the state meteorological office, .※There has been a significant increase [in the last 30 years] in the number of hot days and warm nights and a decreasing trend in the number of cold days and cold nights,§ Alicia Ilaga, head of climate change in the government＊s agriculture department, told me in 2015. ※Both maximum and minimum temperatures are getting warmer. Extreme rainfall events are becoming more frequent. In most parts ... the intensity of rainfall is increasing.§It＊s not just Manila feeling the heat. In its latest , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it expects life in major Asian and African coastal cities like Manila, Guangzhou, Lagos, Ho Chi Minh City, Kolkata and Shanghai to worsen as temperatures rise. ※Urban climate change每related risks are increasing (including rising sea levels and storm surges, heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, drought, increased aridity, water scarcity, and air pollution) with widespread negative impacts on people (and their health, livelihoods, and assets) and on local and national economies and ecosystems,§ it says. ※These risks are amplified for those who live in informal settlements and in hazardous areas and either lack essential infrastructure and services or where there is inadequate provision for adaptation.§ Food supplies are also threatened. I visited the  (IRRI) outside Manila. This research centre, funded by the world＊s richest nations to develop better strains of the crop that feeds nearly half the world, has seen temperatures soar.A few years ago, IRRI＊s deputy director general, Bruce Tolentino, called climate change the greatest global challenge in 50 years. ※The challenge now is to rapidly adapt farming to climate change with modern varieties and feed a fast-growing global population, half of which depends on rice as a staple food. One billion people go hungry every day. In the 1990s, rice yields were growing 2% a year; now they are just 1%. Temperatures here have risen 2每4C.  will reduce productivity. Rainfall is unpredictable and rice is grown in areas like deltas that are prone to sea level rises. We have to gear up for more challenging agro-ecological conditions, we need to be able to use swampy areas and develop varieties that can be grown in salty or flooded areas.§IRRI has been working to develop rice varieties that can withstand extreme climatic conditions such as droughts, floods, heat and cold, and soil problems such as high salt and iron content.  that can produce up to 1.2 metric tons more per hectare [0.54 tons per acre] than varieties that perform poorly under drought conditions have been introduced to India, Nepal and elsewhere.※Every city and every sector of society in the region is at risk,§ says Sano. ※The IPCC tells us it will probably get 4C warmer. That means everything will be compromised, from food and energy to settlements. We are not ready. The challenge is too huge. We are very vulnerable.§Whether it＊s faster than average warming, more vulnerable than average populations, or more severe than average drought, floods and storms, it＊s clear that some places are being hit harder than others by Earth＊s altered climate, and so face extra urgency when it comes to adapting to a new reality.But the bottom line is that climate hotspots intersect, and nowhere will we escape the changes taking place. What happens in the Amazon affects West Africa; the North American growing season may depend on the melting of Arctic ice; flooding in Asian cities affected by warming on the high Tibetan plateau. And urban areas ultimately depend on the countryside. We＊re all in a hot spot now. "																																																			
"Western consumers who buy cheap imported toys, clothes and mobile phones are indirectly contributing to tens of thousands of pollution-related deaths in the countries where the goods are produced, according to a landmark study.Nearly 3.5 million people die prematurely each year due to air pollution, the research estimates, and about 22% of these deaths are associated with goods and services that were produced in one region for consumption in another.The analysis provides the first detailed picture of the extent to which consumer demand in the US and western Europe contributes to pollution in developing countries, with profound health consequences.※If the cost of imported products is lower because of less stringent air pollution controls in the regions where they are produced, then the consumer savings may come at the expense of lives lost elsewhere,§ the authors conclude.The study also reveals how emissions from industrial hotspots affect the health of people in neighbouring countries and, to a lesser extent, more distant regions, as pollutants circulate on global air currents. About 12% (411,100) of early deaths globally were related to air pollutants emitted in a different region of the world, the research found.The study focused on the emission of fine particulate matter pollution (PM 2.5) from power stations, factories, aeroplanes and shipping in 13 regions, taking in data from 228 countries. Particulates are thought to account for more than 90% of the global mortality from outdoor air pollution, raising the number of deaths from heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and asthma.The tiny particles can trigger asthma attacks in the lungs and can cross from the air sacs in the lung into the bloodstream, where they can cause inflammation, alter the way blood clots, and make blood vessels more permeable. Particulates have also been shown to migrate into other tissues, such as the liver, kidneys and brain, although it is less clear what the health consequences are in these organs, and the effects also depend on the chemical makeup of the particulates.※In general, air pollution links to general ill health,§ said Matthew Loxham, a toxicologist at Southampton University who was not involved in the study. ※It＊s a range of different conditions.§The scientists used a combination of air pollution data, emissions measurements and models of global air currents to tally up where pollution was emitted and where it ended up in 2007. An economic model, based on data from the , was then used to attribute air pollution to the demand of consumers for finished goods, although the results were not broken down by product type. caused more than twice the number of deaths worldwide than the emissions of any other region, followed by emissions produced in India and the rest of the Asia region. The scientists calculated that PM 2.5pollution produced in China is linked to more than 64,800 premature deaths in other regions, including more than 3,000 deaths in western Europe and the US.However, this figure was significantly outweighed by the 108,600 premature deaths in China linked to consumption in western Europe and the US.Steven Davis, a co-author based at the University of California, Irvine, said that the paper simply aimed to lay out the evidence for the benefit of policymakers. ※It＊s not really up to us to say what＊s fair or not,§ he said. In a press briefing this week, his co-authors called for international action on the issue. ※For greenhouse gas emissions we have a global agreement. People can argue about whether its been effective or not 每 but at least we have a global framework,§ said Dabo Guan, a professor in climate change economics at the University of East Anglia and the paper＊s senior author. ※People have thought air pollution was a local issue.§Guan cites the example of mobile phones made in China, which might be sold for $200, around 70% of which goes to the company that designed the product and just $5-6 to the Chinese manufacturer.※On average every six months we change our phone,§ he said. ※It has a health cost on the other side of the world.§For countries like China, whose economies are dependent on exporting cheaply-made goods, improving environmental standards has to be balanced against potential negative economic impacts.※Some other country would step up and say hey, we＊re willing to let our people die to have that business,§ said Davis.Improving  in China, India and elsewhere in Asia would have a disproportionately large health benefit in those regions and worldwide, according to the analysis in the journal .Qiang Zhang, another author from Tsinghua University, Beijing, said that consumers in Europe and the US who buy cheap imported toys and clothes also bear a responsibility.※We need to move our lifestyles away from cheap and wasteful,§ he said.Oliver Hayes, a pollution campaigner for Friends of the Earth air pollution, said: ※No-one should be denied the right to breathe clean air, whether they live in Beijing or Barking. But air pollution doesn＊t recognise borders, and it＊s clear that the devastating impacts of polluters can be felt many miles from their activities."																																																			
"We welcome your excellent coverage of President Trump＊s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement (). However, there are references to the US joining Syria and Nicaragua in rejecting the agreement. Presented out of context, this comparison is flawed. Syria didn＊t sign because of the catastrophic civil war. Nicaragua refused to sign because it believes the agreement is too weak to address the enormity of the consequences of climate change, particularly in vulnerable developing countries.Paul Oquist, Nicaraguan representative to the Paris talks, pointed out that the Paris carbon reduction targets are non-binding and even if fully met would lead to a catastrophic three-degree temperature rise. Oquist also highlighted the lack of political will and ambition on the part of the largest polluters, their failure to accept historical responsibility for global warming, and the lack of financial resources for technological transfer, adaptation, and compensation for losses and damages. He went on to say: ※The Paris Agreement will not solve global warming problems but merely postpone them.§Meanwhile, Nicaragua, a country responsible for only 0.3% of global emissions, has a renewable energy target of 90% by 2020. This programme has been praised by the Inter-America Development Bank as ※a model for the world on the shift to green energy§. It is misleading to report, out of context, that the US joins Syria and  on climate change: on this and an increasingly long list of other issues the US stands alone. I am a 73-year-old American citizen, a progressive independent unaffiliated with any major US political party. I read about the controversy regarding Donald Trump＊s state visit to the UK this fall. Like so many Americans, I am incredibly embarrassed and concerned by Mr Trump＊s behaviour at home and on the world stage. Not only his boorishness at the G7 but his reluctance to reaffirm article 5 and the withdrawal from the Paris climate accord have many Americans like me anguished. His governance-by-tweet is egomaniacal and dangerous. These actions lead one to suspect a personality disorder. I therefore write to urge the UK to reconsider this invitation. To reward his policies and behaviour with a state visit is akin to enabling it. "																																																			
"Of course the unacceptable levels of air pollution in our cities is an issue that central and local government must urgently tackle (). However, the elephant in the room is that millions of city dwellers routinely make unnecessary car journeys and they need to accept their responsibility and switch to alternative means of transport. Ironically, those children at London schools and nurseries you highlight are often being poisoned by their own parents＊ vehicles and those of their classmates＊ parents on the school run. I walk my children the mile to their school, while most of their friends are driven through the traffic-choked streets. It takes about the same time, but those families have contributed to the toxicity of the air and have done no exercise."																																																			
"Americans are ※under siege§ from disinformation designed to confuse the public about the threat of climate change, Nasa＊s former chief scientist has said.Speaking to the Guardian, Ellen Stofan, who left the US space agency in December, said that a constant barrage of half-truths had left many Americans oblivious to the potentially dire consequences of continued carbon emissions, despite the science being unequivocal.※We are under siege by fake information that＊s being put forward by people who have a profit motive,§ she said, citing oil and coal companies as culprits. ※Fake news is so harmful because once people take on a concept it＊s very hard to dislodge it.§During the past six months, the US science community has woken up to this threat, according to Stofan, and responded by ratcheting up efforts to communicate with the public at the grassroots level as well as in the mainstream press.※The harder part is this active disinformation campaign,§ she said before her appearance at  this week. ※I＊m always wondering if these people honestly believe the nonsense they put forward. When they say ＆It could be volcanoes＊ or ＆the climate always changes＊＃ to obfuscate and to confuse people, it frankly makes me angry.§Stofan added that while  is frequently characterised as a problem in the right-leaning media, she saw evidence of an ※erosion of people＊s ability to scrutinise information§ across the political spectrum. ※All of us have a responsibility,§ she said. ※There＊s this attitude of ＆I read it on the internet therefore it must be true＊.§Stofan resigned from her post at the top of  in December, but said she had decided to do so before the US election results. ※It wasn＊t anything to do with it, but I＊m glad I＊m not there now,§ she said.However, she welcomed the continued commitment to Nasa＊s  program in the most recent budget and was relieved that cuts to the agency＊s Earth observation program, which contributes to climate and environment monitoring, were relatively small, at $167m (the total Earth science budget is now $1.754bn).Throughout her career, Stofan has highlighted the role of planetary science in understanding the Earth＊s environment and said it provided some of the most inarguable proof that atmospheric carbon dioxide leads to a warmer climate. She draws parallels between carbon emissions on Earth and the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus, a planet which once had oceans but is now a  with surface temperatures approaching 500C.The Earth is not destined for such an extreme scenario 每 even if all the CO2 were burned its oceans would not boil off completely 每 but  demonstrates the dramatic changes that can unfold when the fine balance of planet＊s atmosphere is tipped.※We won＊t go all the way to Venus, but the consequences of putting more and more CO2 into the atmosphere are really dire,§ she said. ※There are models that suggest if we burn off all our fossil fuels, the Earth would become uninhabitable for humans.§The quest to find ※habitable zones§ beyond the Earth has been a major motivation throughout Stofan＊s scientific career and she said that the answer to the question of the existence of extraterrestrial life-forms suddenly seems within reach. Missions to capture water coming from the plumes of Europa and , could yield the first indications. The search is requiring scientists to be imaginative and open-minded about what alien life might look like 每 it might involve complex molecules, but be DNA-free, for instance. The uncertainty over what hypothetical alien life would even look like means that any initial discovery could be ambiguous and a source of scientific dispute, Stofan predicts. ※It would be great if when we found life it was easy and we image a droplet of liquid and something goes swimming across it, no one＊s going to disagree with that,§ she said. A more realistic scenario is that it would take decades for confirmation, and this reasoning is why Stofan is a strong advocate of a manned Mars mission, arguing that a robotic rover would not be capable of reliably confirming the existence of life, past or present, that might be lurking beneath the surface.Human explorers could operate drills designed to extract soil samples from far deeper than the few inches achieved by Nasa＊s Curiosity rover, or the two metres limit anticipated for Esa＊s upcoming ExoMars mission, and could perform more sophisticated scientific analysis. She predicts humans could orbit the red planet within 20 years and reach the surface in 30.※I still feel that to settle the question and to have agreement it＊s going to have a lot of samples and a lot of analysis and to me that means humans,§ she said.However, she dismissed the idea, popularised by Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, that  to avoid self-annihilation. ※I don＊t see a mass transfer of humanity to Mars, ever,§ she said, adding that she had been concerned recently when a teacher told her that her pupils thought the climate ※doesn＊t matter as we＊ll all go and live on Mars§.※Job one is to keep this planet habitable. I＊d hate us to lose focus on that,§ she said. This article was amended on 12 June 2017. An earlier version said Stofan resigned ※in December, before the US election results§. To clarify: she resigned in December, but made the decision before the election results."

Brighton is not normally as warm as Barcelona. Comparing particle pollution,  was worse than  for four smoggy days, from 20 to 23 January, but over the whole month London＊s particle pollution was around a quarter of that in the Chinese capital.However, January＊s smog did break recent records.

Traffic and wood-burning on the evening of Sunday 21 January led to the worst pollution peak since 2011. The smog was not just in London. Index level 10 was measured across south-east England, level nine in Northern Ireland and eight over the Midlands and Bristol.Smogs catapult air pollution into the news and potentially up the political agenda. The deaths of an  in the 1952 smog led to the Clean Air Act and an end to coal pollution in our cities. Images of Beijing smogs led to a change in environmental direction in China.

"or the past three years, Alexander Nolte and Oliver Spies, surfing buddies and co-owners of Langbrett, a German retailer with four stores that sells surf gear and outdoor apparel, have been haunted by news reports connecting many of the products they sell to an emerging but serious environmental threat: microfiber pollution. Synthetic textiles, such as fleece jackets, send tiny plastic fibers into wastewater after washing. These bits eventually make their way into rivers, lakes and our oceans, where they pose health threats to plants and animals. The two men knew they had to act.※We said, ＆either we have to stop selling fleece [apparel] or we have to think of a solution＊,§ explains Nolte. ※So we went out to our beer garden and said ＆what can we do?＊§The beer-filled brainstorming session eventually led to Guppy Friend, a mesh laundry bag, that goes into the washing machine. The bag captures shedding fibers as clothes are tossed and spun, preventing the fibers from escaping. It＊s roomy enough for a couple of fleece jackets or other apparel made of synthetic fabric. In two weeks, Langbrett, in partnership with outdoor clothing company Patagonia, will start shipping the Guppy Friend to the backers of their Kickstarter campaign. Patagonia will then begin selling the bag to customers.The  is the first device designed and marketed specifically to prevent microfiber pollution. Microfibers are tiny, so they can easily move through sewage treatment plants. Natural fibers, such as cotton or wool, biodegrade over time. But synthetic fibers are problematic because they do not biodegrade, and tend to bind with molecules of harmful chemical pollutants found in wastewater, such as pesticides or flame retardants. Plus, fibers from apparel are often coated with chemicals to achieve performance attributes such as water resistance. Studies have shown  among plankton and other small organisms that eat microfibers, which then make their way up the food chain. Researchers have found high numbers of  and shellfish sold at markets.To date, no studies have shown that microfibers cause health problems in humans. But that＊s cold comfort to Nolte: ※Scientific research is slow, so it might take another generation to find out what harm [these pollutants] will do. I don＊t want to wait that long.§Nolte and Spies worked with German research institute to test and vet the bag＊s design and material. They settled on polyamide, also known as nylon, that doesn＊t shed fibers easily. It＊s made with a 50-micron mesh, a width that allows soapy water to enter the bag without allowing fibers to leave. When the bag is removed from the washer at the end of a cycle, the fiber 每 visible against the white mesh 每 can be removed by hand and disposed of. Tests show that the bag remains functional and intact after hundreds of washings.The duo isn＊t alone in tackling the problem in the laundry room. A startup called the Rozalia Project is developing a microfiber-catching device, but it is not yet available. Devices called after-market filters are already available 每 these are designed to reduce the amount of lint that enters septic systems. But unless you have some plumbing skills, hiring a plumber to install the $130 filters can be expensive.Guppy Friend attracted the attention of Patagonia last summer when word about the project reached Phil Graves, managing director of Tin Shed Ventures, Patagonia＊s investment fund. Patagonia already had a relationship with Langbrett, which sells Patagonia clothing.Patagonia is interested in reducing microfiber pollution, based on the results of  it commissioned at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2015. Researchers calculated the microfibers shed from Patagonia outerwear during laundry, and found that a single fleece jacket sheds as many as 250,000 synthetic fibers. Using sales numbers, the researchers extrapolated that about 100,000 jackets are in use worldwide each year, and washing them would produce enough plastic to make 11,900 grocery bags.※We received early prototypes [of the bag] and tested them with the UCSB researchers we had worked with on our fiber loss study. They confirmed that the bag trapped anywhere from 90-95% of fibers,§ Graves says. ※We brought in our material engineers and gave [Nolte and Spies] feedback on construction.§ Nolte says design improvements have boosted the bag＊s ability to capture fibers to 99%.Patagonia gave Nolte and Spies financial support 每 a 100,000 ($108,000) grant 每 to develop the mesh bag and a supply chain for it. The duo also launched the Kickstarter campaign that ran from last October to December and raised 28,640 ($30,604) from 668 backers.In exchange for the grant, Nolte and Spies agreed to let Patagonia be the first retailer, aside from Langbrett, to sell Guppy Friend.Patagonia plans to sell Guppy Friend at the cost of buying and shipping it from Nolte and Spies 每 the California company won＊t be making a profit. It hasn＊t settled on a retail price yet, but it will likely be between $20-$30.Since sales of synthetic fabric, Guppy Friend will need to be a big seller to make a dent in microfiber pollution. So how likely is that?It will require some convincing. Nik Sawe, a Stanford University researcher who uses neuroscience to study how consumers make decisions on environmental issues, says the key is to use emotion to influence behavior. ※If Guppy Friend can appeal to consumers＊ feelings around the negative impacts of microfiber pollution, it might be able to elicit them to spend $20 or $30 for the bag,§ he says. In the meantime, Nolte says he＊s gotten a lot of interest from retailers. So far, he and Nolte have 30,000 pre-orders for Guppy Friend, from Patagonia and other retailers he could not yet name.Next up: Nolte and Spies are also working on reducing microfiber losses before the fabric reaches the laundry room. They are working with Deutsche Textilforschungszentrum, a German standards body, to create a metric that will show the rate/amount of fiber losses of a given textile. They hope clothing designers will choose fabrics that aren＊t prone to shedding.※We know that higher quality fabrics shed fewer fibers,§ he says. He hopes the testing standard will make that clear to brands and consumers. But eventually it might take government regulation to curb the sale of high-shed synthetics, he says.But with Guppy Friend, he says: ※We can act now. We do not need to wait for anyone.§"																																																			
"Downing Street has defended  not signing up to a joint declaration by Germany, France and Italy in opposition to Donald Trump＊s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord by stressing that other countries also chose a different path.A source pointed out that Japan and Canada had not signed up to the letter and said the prime minister＊s approach was ※consistent as to how we approach dealings with international leaders§. They said May first wanted to speak to the US president and claimed she was robust in her disappointment during a phone call.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, earlier accused May of a  for failing to issue a stronger condemnation.He told an election rally in York: ※Given the chance to present a united front with our international partners, she has instead opted for silence and subservience to .§A Downing Street spokesperson said Trump had called May to discuss the decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement and said the door remained open to future US involvement in the deal.※She [May] said the Paris agreement provides the right global framework for protecting the prosperity and security of future generations, while keeping energy affordable and secure for our citizens and businesses,§ the spokesperson said.※The president made clear that the door remains open to future US involvement in the agreement.§They said the pair had also agreed on the importance of continued cooperation on wider energy issues. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband said BBC Radio＊s World at One that May was being ※weak and feeble and spineless§ for not being willing to condemn the US president.When it was put to him that May has said she expressed disappointment about Trump＊s decision, Miliband replied: ※Disappointment is when your football team loses a match. It is not when somebody makes a devastating decision like this. America is one of the two largest emitters in the world, along with China. This decision was backed by every country in the world apart from Syria, which is in the middle of a civil war, and Nicaragua, which wanted us to go further. American leadership was so important to this.§"																																																			
"London＊s that motorists should be given up to ?3,500 to persuade them to scrap their old diesel cars and vans and replace them with cleaner vehicles, according to the capital＊s mayor, Sadiq Khan.The nitrogen dioxide emitted by diesel cars is a key contributor to London＊s poor air quality, which is so bad that City Hall on the worst-affected days.Khan is urging the government to introduce a scrappage scheme, costing an estimated ?500m, that would offer incentives to low-income households and businesses to get rid of their older vehicles. He would also like to see the car tax redesigned so that it no longer gives drivers an incentive to choose a diesel car. ※The toxic state of our air leaves us with no choice but to rid our city of the most polluting diesel vehicles. It is shocking that nearly half of new car sales in the UK are still diesel vehicles and the national system of vehicle excise duty still incentivises motorists to buy these polluting cars,§ Khan said.※I＊m urging government to immediately review this policy, and today I＊ve delivered a detailed report on how it can deliver an effective national diesel scrappage fund. One that both fairly compensates motorists and rapidly helps clean up our filthy air.Air pollution causesand ?27.5bn in costs every year, according to the government＊s estimates, and was called a ※public health emergency§ by MPs in April.Policies, including those on vehicle excise duty, were tailored to incentivise drivers to choose diesel cars, when the carbon dioxide emitted by petrol cars was deemed the most dangerous pollutant because of its contribution to global warming.But policymakers have become increasingly concerned about emissions of nitrogen oxides from diesels.Under the mayor＊s proposed scrappage scheme, van drivers in  would be given ?3,500 towards the cost of a cleaner model, and low-income households could receive a credit worth ?2,000 that they could use on alternative transport, such as joining a car pool, or on a new vehicle. Khan said that he had delivered the proposals to relevant ministers, including the chancellor Philip Hammond.The package of measures could cost the Treasury more than ?500m in London alone, but the government has made clear that it is considering taking tougher action to improve the capital＊s air quality, and it has lost two recent court cases about the issue.Ministers are also concerned about other sources of pollution, including from wood-burning stoves in homes.Asked about air pollution in the capital by London MP Ruth Cadbury earlier this month, Theresa May said: ※This government takes the issue of air quality very seriously. A lot of work has been done. Since 2011 more than ?2bn has been committed to enable, for example, bus operators to upgrade their fleets, and to ensure that changes are made to reduce pollution from vehicles such as refuse trucks and fire engines. We do recognise, however, that more needs to be done§.The prime minister added: ※We will bring forward proposals to ensure that we can maintain the air quality that we all want to see.§Khan said he had drawn up a series of policies to try to cut pollution in London, including plans for an ultra-low emission zone that he hopes to extend out as far as the north and south circular peripheral roads, and charges for the most polluting vehicles. But he said he does not have the powers to take more radical action. ※The government needs to help us clean up the dangerous air in London,§ he said.City Hall believes a scrappage scheme could eventually be rolled out nationally, to help other cities tackle pollution problems. The Treasury introduced a nationwide car scrappage scheme during the 2009 recession, to prevent demand for cars drying up as consumer confidence?plunged.Gerry Keaney, chief executive of the British Vehicle Rental Leasing Association, said: ※There is an urgent need to address pollution in our cities, which requires a change in the way we travel and the vehicles we use. We believe the mayor＊s proposal for a national vehicle scrappage fund could make a significant contribution in reducing emissions by removing some of the oldest, most polluting vans and cars from our streets.§The scheme, drawn up by  for London with the help of an economic consultancy, is designed to allow the government to fulfil its obligations under European law to clean up air quality."																																																			
"f you＊ve ever visited the , or are one of the 70,000 people whose job relies upon it, you know why it＊s considered one of the seven natural wonders of the world.Yet it faces more pressure than ever before, from global warming, water quality, industrialisation of the coastline, and ever more extreme weather.Earlier this decade, the coal bonanza coming out of  saw proposals for six new or expanded ports and thousands more coal ships, fed by multiple proposed mega mines. It was this industrialisation of the reef with mass dredging and offshore dumping of sludge that first saw the world heritage committee warn Australia that the reef could be placed on the ※in-danger§ list.The community and scientists were outraged, and in parliament the  moved Senate inquiries and private members＊ bills to stop the onslaught the reef was facing. Faced with an international shame listing of ※in danger§ that would jeopardise this $6bn tourism icon, port proposals were marginally scaled back and both state and federal governments finally backflipped and ended offshore dumping of sludge into the reef＊s waters from capital dredging. The reef was placed on the watch list for in-danger listing and governments said pretty words about doing more to save it.Then 2016 happened.A combination of fossil-fuel-driven global warming and El Ni?o saw the reef＊s water temperatures skyrocket, which caused the worst mass coral bleaching the reef had ever faced. There was no temperature respite for that coral to bounce back after the bleaching, and almost one quarter of the reef＊s corals died, including two-thirds of the corals in the 700km northern section of the reef.On Friday,  on what they were doing about those earlier concerns and this mass bleaching event.It was a dog-ate-my-homework moment.What we saw was re-announcement of old plans and no new funding. The government is risking a fail on their reef homework by underfunding their Reef Plan, delaying water quality targets, spruiking new coal and ignoring global warming after the worst coral bleaching the reef has ever seen. The federal government＊s response plan to the worst-ever bleaching event on the reef says global warming was the cause but doesn＊t include any action or new funding to address it.Worse still, the Australian and Queensland governments are still desperately pushing to open up the Adani mega coalmine which would put the Great Barrier Reef in grave peril.The Greens are worried that our governments＊ inaction and their capitulation to big coal companies will tempt  to put the reef back on the world heritage in-danger list.Global warming is the biggest long-term threat to the reef, but we must also urgently fix water pollution from land clearing and agriculture. We have ambitious water quality targets, including an 80% cut to nitrogen pollution by 2025, but report after report shows we＊re nowhere near on track to meet them. The experts in the Queensland government＊s own Great Barrier Reef water science taskforce called for a massive funding boost up to $8.2bn, but our governments have simply dismissed them. Just this week, the Queensland government decided to keep using the reef＊s waters as a rubbish tip for dumping one million cubic metres of sludge from maintenance dredging, in their long overdue but nearly toothless.Elsewhere in Queensland, more than 300,000 hectares of native woodland is being cleared every year, sending rivers of sediment flowing into the reef. Despite promising to stop this clearing frenzy, the Queensland Labor government waited too long to act, and tree-clearing protections were recently voted down in the parliament.Earlier this year, I visited the worst-hit area of the reef at Lizard Island along with some of Australia＊s leading reef scientists and saw the destruction first-hand. The devastation was horrifying. Our leading scientists have told us of weeping into their dive masks as they witnessed the destruction.The have told us that if the current trajectory of global warming continues, even if we do fix water pollution, the reef will suffer terrible bleaching every two years by the 2030s. To save the reef and avoid an in-danger listing, both levels of government need a response to global warming that includes scrapping the Adani coalmine and banning all new coalmines, moving to 100% clean energy, finally banning all dredge sludge dumping including maintenance dredging, and strong land clearing laws.It＊s not too late, but time is running out to save our reef＊s future and secure a bright future for all Queenslanders. It＊s time for our leaders to step up."																																																			
																																																			
"Air quality alerts have been issued at bus stops, tube stations and roadsides across London because of high pollution levels, said a spokeswoman for the mayor of London, .The alerts will notify Londoners on Thursday evening during their commute home from work.People in  who suffer from lung or heart problems have been warned to avoid strenuous exercise. The risks from heightened levels of air pollution enveloping the city have been exacerbated by settled and cold conditions, which have prevented pollutants from being dispersed.Individuals at risk have been warned to particularly avoid outdoor exercise, while those with asthma may need to use their inhaler more often, according to the , based at King＊s College University.Anyone from the wider population who experiences sore eyes, a cough or sore throat should also consider reducing their physical activity, particularly outdoors, the pollution monitoring service said.Air pollution campaigners called on the government and city authorities to restrict traffic during smog episodes.※When pollution episodes are high, the mayor should introduce emergency traffic restrictions to bring pollution levels down quickly,§ said a spokeswoman for Friends of the Earth. ※The solutions proposed for dealing with the latest smog have things backwards: the first step should be restricting traffic not people.※It＊s outrageous that those with vulnerable lungs, including children and the elderly, are told to stay at home when the air is bad. Everyone should be able to go about their business, without being afraid of the air they breathe.§According to the London Air Quality Network, winter smogs are formed when pollutants from traffic and industry are trapped at ground level because of a temperature inversion. The pollution is a mix of ultra-fine particulates of unburned carbon, known as PM2.5s, and the toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which is largely created by diesel cars, lorries and buses.Thursday＊s pollution episode took place on the same day as Nice, the government＊s independent health advisers, proposed that councils in England should be given powers to set up clean-air zones. This would allow them to restrict certain vehicles entering some areas. About 9,500 people die early each year in London due to long-term exposure to air pollution, more than twice as many as previously thought, according to new research. Air pollution is now Britain＊s most lethal environmental risk, killing about 40,000 people prematurely each year.Air pollution monitors showed high or very high pollution along all major London roads, with extremely high pollution recorded in the city centre. On Thursday, a Defra pollution monitor on Marylebone Road also registered very high levels.Khan made tackling London＊s air pollution a priority issue in his election campaign. This summer he announced his intention to issue alerts for high pollution. However, there have been no incidents of particularly high pollution until now.Khan said: ※Londoners need to know when the city is suffering from high pollution levels so they can take any necessary appropriate measures to protect themselves from poor air quality. This is particularly crucial for Londoners who are vulnerable, such as asthma sufferers.§"																																																			
"ince day one as a contender for the Oval Office, current US President Donald Trump has pushed a dominant narrative: he＊s a businessman. He gets economics. He knows the art of the deal. This week, with his decision to , the president has given the world strong reason to reject that narrative.His rationale 每 that it＊s a choice of economy over environment, and a fossil fuel economy is the top priority 每 is outdated and false. States and nations around the world have harvested the fruits of clean energy, and are redefining their economies and energy sources accordingly. Yet under false pretenses that ※clean coal§, natural gas and other fossil fuel fixes are better than energy conservation and clean energy, the US forges its own, lonely path.The idea that clean, renewable energy will generate power for our planet for generations to come is not rhetoric. The extent of human-caused climate change 每 and the rapidly improving economics driving the proliferation of renewable energy sources 每 make it fact.If the US administration isn＊t ready to move forward, hundreds of individual states and other countries will. California is already a world leader on climate policy. Texas is rapidly expanding its wind energy capacity. In Germany, clean energy has become a movement itself, focused on thousands of small-scale projects under the Energiewende program. In Scotland, wind generation has increased by 81% over the past year, and in March this year, it produced enough energy to satisfy 136 % of the country＊s household energy needs. These are just a few examples.The US＊s withdrawal doesn＊t mean Americans and US investors will sit still, either. There is substantial economic opportunity in renewables. The US solar industry alone creates . Worldwide, nearly 10 million people already work in renewable energy. Global clean technology exports doubled between 2008 and 2015, surpassing $1.15tn per year. Even America＊s corporate giants 每 from Apple and Google to Walmart, and even oil giant Exxon Mobil 每 support the Paris agreement.The economics are clear. So what about the political implications of the decision?By withdrawing from this historical agreement, Trump will make more enemies than friends.Polling results from Yale University＊s Climate Change in the American Mind survey (conducted after the US election) show thatwant the US to use more renewable energy. (His own supporters!) As recently as May 7, a small but increasingly vocal group of Republicans has embraced the reality of global warming, taking steps to press the issue in Congress.Elsewhere in the world, 195 countries and the European Union have signed the Paris Agreement, 147 of which have ratified it. Only Nicaragua and Syria have not signed on. When news of the potential withdrawal reached the United Nations, the organization＊s Twitter page read: ※Climate change is undeniable.  is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.§A Globe and Mail report showed that even fossil fuel companies 每 the likes of ExxonMobil, BP and Shell 每 think the US should stick with Paris.This withdrawal is an ugly decision, made by a country that ought to be leading the transition to a cleaner future 每 not only because of its stature as an international economic powerhouse, but also because of its less-than-desirable environmental track record.After China, the US is the world＊s second-largest greenhouse gas polluter. In response, China has been become a leading producer of solar energy technology and is slowing its coal power construction.The US, meanwhile, hangs on to a coal industry that should have been dissolved decades ago.Just north of the border in Canada, where I live, the situation is delicate. We have been plagued by recent missteps such as approval of fossil-fuel-driven pipeline projects, but at least our governments claim a commitment to a sustainable, clean energy future. In my home province of British Columbia, recent election results may even reverse the approval of some of those infrastructure projects. But we＊re far from safe ground. These types of actions by the US administration show that environmental rights 每 for Canada and all countries around the world 每 are vital, now more than ever. Yet, while 110 countries worldwide have environmental rights written into their constitutions, Canada does not. I tend to focus my advice on domestic matters like these. But today, I offer a word to the US president: A global shift to renewable energy is on. There＊s no denying it or turning it around. It＊s good for business. This is not fake news. It＊s real life. And it＊s happening with or without you. You claim you know a good deal when you see one. Well, you just passed on one of the best our planet has ever seen.

"Speed bumps should be redesigned, speed limits made variable on England＊s motorways, sometimes dropping as low as 50mph, and a congestion charge considered in more cities to cut air pollution and save lives, health experts have said.The  (Nice) released a series of recommendations on Thursday which it said would ※promote a smoother driving style§ and help keep emissions down. officials said vehicles created more emissions when they were speeding up and slowing down, as on congested motorways. To keep a more consistent speed, they said, the limit could be temporarily lowered to 50 or 60 mph when traffic is stop-start. That represented a ※more sensible§ approach than having lower fixed limits, Nice＊s Prof Mark Baker said.The officials added that some speed bumps encouraged people to speed up, then slow down. They recommended that, where this was the case, but where such measures were still needed to reduce road injuries, they be designed to ※minimise their impact on air pollution§.They also urged planners to consider using average speed technology on the roads to promote smoother driving.  by the RAC Foundation showed that cameras measuring average speeds were now monitoring drivers on more than 250 miles of Britain＊s roads. Sections covered range in length from a quarter of a mile on London＊s Tower Bridge to 99 miles on the A9 between Dunblane and Inverness in Scotland.On top of that, they want towns and cities with pollution problems to consider implementing clean air zones and look into the possibility of introducing congestion charging zones.The draft guidance for England also contains proposals for ※no-idling§ zones around schools to prevent parents leaving their cars running during school drop-offs. Air pollution is a contributory factor to about 25,000 deaths a year in England, almost 5% of all deaths, Nice said, and road traffic is estimated to contribute to about a third of air pollution in urban sites.Provisional figures show that road usage is at record levels, with an estimated 320bn vehicle miles travelled on Britain＊s roads in the year ending September 2016. Health campaigners welcomed the draft proposals, which were devised for local authority staff and are out for consultation, but environmental groups called for more stringent measures.The British Lung Foundation said it backed the plans because ※air pollution contributes to tens of thousands of early deaths every year§ and the British Heart Foundation called them a ※step in the right direction§.Jenny Bates, a Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, said the proposals were to be welcomed but that ※we must deal with the real crux of the issue and reduce air pollution levels§. She said: ※Action is needed both to ensure vehicles on the road are clean and that there are fewer of them. Diesel vehicles, which are the most polluting, must be phased out and our transport and planning policy needs a radical overhaul.§Nice officials called for a review of trees lining streets in urban areas. ※In some cases, they restrict street ventilation, causing poorer air quality. In others they improve it§. It also warns that solid barriers placed next to roads to mitigate noise can actually lead to a wider dispersal of pollution.Other suggestions by Nice included: Town planners should avoid putting cycle routes on heavily polluted roads but, where this was unavoidable, they should consider using foliage to screen cyclists from vehicles. . Local authorities may want to look into setting a standard for the types of cars used for taxis. Some areas should consider public awareness initiatives such as ※car-free days§. Those could be similar to measures sometimes used in Paris, which only allows drivers with a number plate ending in an odd or even number into the city on given days when pollution reaches high levels. House builders should place living rooms at the back of houses away from roads and hedgerows should be grown to protect cyclists using cycle paths."																																																			
"Delhi has been blanketed in a toxic fog the morning after the Hindu festival of Diwali, when hundreds of thousands of people in the Indian capital celebrate by setting off crackers and fireworks.Air quality in the Indian capital, one of the world＊s most polluted cities, is usually very poor due to road dust, open fires, vehicle exhaust fumes, industrial emissions and the burning of crop residues in neighbouring states.But the density of some harmful particles and droplets in the air spikes for days after Diwali and can reach up to 42 times the safe limit.An air quality station at the US embassy in Chanakyapuri, one of the city＊s greener districts, . India＊s pollution control board sets the safe limit for PM2.5 每 which measures particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometres 每 at 60.By contrast, the highest PM2.5 level recorded in London on Monday morning  at a measuring station in Farringdon.

PM2.5 particles and droplets are considered to be the most harmful kind of air pollution because they are fine enough to evade the body＊s natural filters, penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream.Short-term exposure can trigger coughing and eye and throat irritation, while longer term exposure is strongly associated with reduced lung function, heart disease and lung cancer.  found about half of Delhi＊s 4.4 million schoolchildren had compromised lung capacity and would never completely recover.  also has the world＊s highest rate of death from respiratory disease, according to the World Health Organisation, with 159 deaths per 100,000 people in 2012, about five times that of the UK and twice that of China.※The levels we＊re seeing are really alarming. They are clearly in the severe category,§ said Anumita Roychowdhury, the executive director of the Centre for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based thinktank.※Delhi＊s air remains so polluted throughout the year that it doesn＊t really have room for additional pollution during Diwali.§She said the smog released by the fireworks was worsened by the seasonally cooler temperature and slowing winds, which meant ※the air doesn＊t blow away, and all the pollution that happens inside the city gets trapped at the ground level, very close to our noses§.The city authorities , depending on whether their last registration number was odd or even.The odd-even scheme has been trialled twice and its impact on air quality is being investigated.Unlike in China, where a PM2.5 reading greater than 300 for more than three days triggers a ※red alert§ that closes schools, there are no official government warnings over high levels of air pollution. The capital region＊s high court last year  of successive Delhi and national governments in dealing with the problem and compared the megacity of more than 25 million people to ※a gas chamber§.Roychowdhury said awareness of the problem was slowly growing among Delhi＊s residents. ※Newspapers are writing about it every day, it＊s part of the dinner table conversation,§ she said.※Where we still have a lot more to do is to sensitise people about the solutions to the problem. We need to understand that controlling it needs hard decisions, and to build public support for these hard decisions.§"																																																			
"Small but inevitable rises in sea level will double the frequency of severe coastal flooding in most of the world with dire consequences for major cities that sit on coastlines, according to scientists.The research takes in to account the large waves and storm surges that can tip gradually rising sea levels over the edge of coastal defences. Lower latitudes will be first affected, in a great swath through the tropics from Africa to South America and throughout south-east Asia, with Europe＊s Atlantic coast and the west coast of the US not far behind.The most vulnerable places, including large cities in Brazil and Ivory Coast, and small Pacific islands, are expected to experience the doubling within a decade. ※It is pretty much inevitable that we are going to see increased frequency of extreme water levels 每 there is no way around this,§ said Sean Vitousek, at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who led the research. is causing sea levels to rise at about 4mm per year, as ice caps melt and the oceans warm and expand. This will continue for many years due to the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.The steady rise in sea level is unlikely to cause flooding directly as coastline developments are designed to withstand the larger ebb and flow of the tides. But the rising level gives a higher starting point for the storm surges and big waves that can overwhelm coastal defences.The research, , is the first to analyse these factors, particularly waves, on a global scale. It found that the most at-risk areas were in the low latitudes, where tidal ranges are smaller meaning sea level rise is proportionally more significant. In those locations, just 2.5cm of sea level rise leads to extreme water levels being seen twice as often, while a 5-10cm increase means coastal floods are twice as likely across all the tropics. A rise of 20cm leaves almost every coast with twice the risk.Projections of sea level rise vary, with the UN＊s  an increase between 30cm and 100cm by 2100. But more recent research has suggested the  in a warming world and that oceans levels could rise more rapidly to reach 200-300cm by the end of the century. The rise of 5-10cm, likely to occur within a couple of decades, would mean major cities including San Francisco in the US, Mumbai in India, Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam and Abidjan in Ivory Coast facing a doubled risk of coastal floods. ※The maps of increased flooding potential suggest a dire future,§ write the scientists.※This study shows how even small changes in mean sea level can significantly increase the frequencies with which critical thresholds are exceeded,§ said Thomas Wahl, professor of coastal risks at the University of Central Florida, who was not part of the research team. ※For coastal communities that means they need to adapt in order to prevent flood events from happening much more often,§ Wahl said. ※In the end, however, it still needs more localised studies in order for coastal managers to make important decisions on the ground.§ Previous research estimated the damages from  by 2050.Vitousek said: ※We are going to have to [cut carbon dioxide emissions] and engineer the coastlines to stop a lot of these events from happening. We want Greenland and Antarctica to remain as ice for as long as possible.※One metre of sea level rise is going to be a game-changer for the coastal zone. The next time you are at the beach or down by the water, think about what that area would be like in some of these sea level rise scenarios, half a metre or metre. You＊ll see it＊s a pretty scary proposition.§"																																																			
"ities around the world confront a huge and pressing problem: how do you accommodate growing numbers of people? It is forecast that by 2050,  of the world＊s population will live in urban areas, and transport planners face the daunting task of making sure everyone can move around without too much of a struggle.The UK＊s population is expected to grow by almost 10 million over the next 25 years 每 London＊s population could reach 9.8 million by 2025. Since many of our cities already suffer from overcrowding on trains, congestion on roads and worsening air pollution, there is an urgent need to find new ways to adapt to the demographic changes.How will our transport systems cope? How might we best utilise new technologies to make our journeys more productive and less polluting? The Guardian, supported by Heathrow, recently hosted a roundtable discussion to address some of these issues.While the scale of the challenge is formidable, there is optimism cities can handle peak populations and even be made more liveable, the roundtable heard. ※Transport is a force for change,§ said Susan Claris, associate director at Arup, the engineering, planning and design firm. ※It can help shape better cities, and make them more socially inclusive.§Many of the experts on the panel identified the humble car as holding huge potential for a more efficient transport system. ※Cars are amazingly efficient vehicles when they have four or five people in them, and we should be doing more to encourage more efficient use,§ said Ali Clabburn, CEO of Liftshare, a social enterprise offering commuters the chance to organise shared car journeys. ※At peak hours, every train or bus is full, and there are millions of empty [car] seats on the road. It＊s a crazy situation,§ she added.There is also greater potential for shared ownership of cars, according to Martin Uhlarik, Tata Motors＊ UK head of design. ※The shared economy opens up the potential for people to share the product and use [each car] three or four times as much,§ he said.Uhlarik believes advances in self-driving technology could change the nature of long car commutes. ※Autonomous vehicles will be arriving,§ he said. ※And once they come, we might still spend two hours in traffic, but it＊s a chance to question how you are spending that quality time. Are you working? Are you entertaining yourself? It might be about managing your time better.§Working life in Britain today still revolves, largely, around a nine-to-five schedule. Debra Charles, CEO of smartcard company Novacroft, would like to see business and government get behind a major programme to promote flexible working, leading to fewer peak time journeys. ※We＊ve got flexible working to some degree in the UK, but what if that was better incentivised? The rigidness of the way people work 每 if we could change that it would make a difference.§Shifting the nature of short journeys will also be vital. A recent report by the  found that more than one third of all car trips in the capital are less than 2km, and could be walked in 25 minutes or less. The same report shows 2.7m daily car trips in London could be cycled. Getting people out of their cars and walking or cycling could boost health and reduce congestion.Many cities have made bold moves to encourage active lifestyles. Both New York and Paris have made efforts to repurpose parking spots for walking, biking, and public space. In Copenhagen, pedestrianising shopping streets and raising parking prices has seen the proportion of people driving to work . Claris would like to see more trials run by local authorities in the UK to assess the benefits of pedestrianisation. ※If you make cities more pleasant to walk around in, then even the most reluctant walkers will think, ＆It＊s not actually so bad,＊§ she said.Tom Cohen, deputy director of the UCL  Institute, agreed. ※People are dying because of inactivity. Whatever we might say about the future of transport in cities, it has to incorporate physically active travel.§Some business leaders on the panel believe commuters can be usefully nudged into streamlined routines to cut down on unnecessary road trips. Parcel service Doddle, for instance, offers commuters the chance to pick up their online orders from its stores in train stations, saving delivery vans from making so many repeated trips to customers＊ doors when they＊re out at work. ※If you＊re trying to change behaviour, it＊s about how intuitive and accessible you make things for people,§ said Tim Robinson, Doddle＊s CEO.Rail commuters are already getting their grocery shopping done at major station supermarkets on their way home, and some are also choosing to hold business meetings at station restaurants and cafes. Tim Hedley-Jones, major projects director for Virgin Trains East Coast, said larger train stations are becoming ※the focus of their community§.Hedley-Jones also said the UK could alter planning policy to make better use of the ※huge quantities§ of brownfield land near train stations. ※If you can give people good quality housing next to good quality public transport, then you can start to break the cycle of car dependency for short journeys.§There remains, however, the almighty task of making sure public transport is ready to cope with increased passenger numbers. Despite major infrastructure projects such as HS2, Crossrail 1 and Crossrail 2, Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King＊s College London, said even more capacity was needed in the south east, particularly across south London. ※In London, we have a world class transport system, but it＊s still not good enough,§ he said. ※We need to get more people in our underground systems, we need to think about tram systems, and getting it all joined up with the National Rail network in a much better way.§John Holland-Kaye, CEO of Heathrow, which is waiting for parliamentary approval for its third runway, said his airport is experimenting to make sure increasing passenger numbers does not mean more congestion. There are improved links to public transport, a large staff car-sharing scheme, and driverless pods that carry people to Terminal 5. ※We can pioneer with some of these things, make them happen, and hopefully develop models that can be applied elsewhere,§ said Holland-Kaye.If some major, energy-intensive engineering works are inevitable, there are high hopes new ways of sharing data can make the transport system as sustainable and efficient as possible.In Bristol, the city council has developed a web-based service, the Bristol API, that allows any developer to connect their app to existing transport data: route maps, live train and bus times, and car park occupancy. ※Once you build transport infrastructure, it just gets full again, quickly,§ said Stephen Hilton, Bristol city council＊s futures director. ※So the real challenge is about trying to use every bit of spare capacity within the infrastructure that＊s not being used effectively.§Data might also be better used to give walkers and cyclists the chance to choose the least health-harming journeys. Londoners have become particularly conscious of poor air quality. Almost all of this year＊s mayoral candidates offered measures to tackle air toxicity, and Sadiq Khan has pledged to bring in  in central London in 2019.Researchers at King＊s College London have  for the iPhone, which visualises air pollution levels in the city and allows users to check how much longer a less pollution-choked route might take. ※The technology is there to give people an informed choice,§ said Kelly. ※But we need to do more and we need to do it more quickly.§The experts on the panel agreed government and business need to work together to support innovation. In Bristol, waste-to-energy company GENeco has partnered with Wessex Bus to apply for a government grant to bring 20 ※poo-powered§ bio-buses to the city by 2019 每 the buses will run on biomethane gas generated from sewage and food waste. ※We felt in our wacky way we could demonstrate there＊s a form of transport that reduces noxious emissions,§ explained GENeco＊s managing director Mohammed Saddiq.Uhlarik said the particularly rapid growth of London and the south east presents an opportunity for businesses in the UK to spearhead international solutions. ※The growth of big urban centres is a phenomenon that＊s accelerating,§ said Uhlarik. ※It＊s a global issue, but London could be a test bed because of the higher level of technology here and, potentially, the organisational skill.§"																																																			
"A push from developing countries to force fossil fuel lobbyists taking part in UN climate talks to declare their conflicts of interest has won a significant battle against resistance from the world＊s biggest economies including the European Union, US and Australia.The  (UNFCCC) has agreed to enhance ※openness and transparency§ for outside parties and will accept submissions from any stakeholder 每 which could be any person or group affected by climate change or climate change policy 每 on how it could do so.※The result was pretty good 每 understanding that the world＊s largest economic powers were adamantly opposed to anything to do with integrity or conflict of interest at all,§ said Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability International, which has been running a campaign on the issue.Since May 2016, Ecuador and Venezuela 每 on behalf of the Like Minded Group of Developing Countries that represents that majority of the world＊s population 每 had been fighting to have a conflict of interest policy introduced where groups with ※observer status§ must declare their conflicts.Organisations that have observer status, and can therefore attend meetings and walk the corridors of the conferences, include industry groups that represent all of the world＊s biggest fossil fuel companies such as , Shell, BP and BHP. Many of them have lobbied against policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.In May 2016 at a UNFCCC meeting in Bonn, the Venezuelan delegate said the Paris agreement was an ※instrument between states§ and made a ※moral request§ that lobbyists should have to declare conflicts of interest.The move was successfully opposed by rich nations, with the US, EU, Norway and Australia leading the battle.But the issue was  and continued this month in Bonn where the Australian ambassador for the environment and lead delegate to the UNFCCC, Patrick Suckling, championed the role of fossil fuel companies in helping to craft climate change policy.※Some of the companies being alluded to as the polluters of policy, they will be, some of them, the providers of the biggest and best solutions,§ . ※And you could look at some of the statements coming out of ExxonMobil and Shell recently to underline that point.§ExxonMobil  their knowledge about climate change for decades and  they continue to fund efforts to manipulate public discussions of climate change.On Tuesday, in a closed-door meeting in Bonn, the discussion continued with the US and Australia fighting to remove any language that included the phrase ※conflict of interest§ or ※integrity§. The Guardian understands the US delegate argued that the US and Ecuador had ※divergent views§ on what integrity meant.The US, New Zealand, Australia and the EU also opposed Ecuador＊s moves to call for a reporting process, where stakeholders could submit their views on developing a conflict of interest policy, or on a way of improving the ※integrity§ of the UNFCCC＊s engagement with non-party stakeholders.But on Tuesday in Bonn, Ecuador successfully negotiated an agreement that committed the UNFCCC to enhance the ※openness, transparency and inclusiveness of the UNFCCC process§ and another that called for stakeholders to submit their views on how that could be achieved.As a result, the discussion will continue in a year＊s time, with the input of anyone who submits their views through the UNFCCC website.The discussions appeared to shake-up the fossil fuel lobby, with some organising side events at the Bonn meeting to defend their role at the UNFCCC.Stephen Eule, a climate analyst at the US Chamber of Commerce 每 a group with observer status at the UNFCCC 每  where he spoke of the need to engage the coal industry; described the US commitments under the Paris agreement as ※unrealistically ambitious§; and approvingly described Donald Trump＊s moves to dismantle Barack Obama＊s environmental regulations.Eule said the Paris agreement was ※lopsided and puts the US at a competitive disadvantage§, saying he expects the Trump administration to negotiate ※to get a better deal for the US§.In , Eule defended the role the body plays in the the UNFCCC processes, saying it would continue to ※look after the interests of our members and speak out on the issues that concern us§.According to a Corporate Accountability International , the US Chamber of Commerce has received millions of dollars from ExxonMobil for ※public information campaigns§ and executives from Peabody Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Sempra Energy sit on its board of directors.※As longs as your business model depends on extracting and burning fossil fuels, you have no place helping to craft climate policy,§ Bragg said. ※Your profit incentive is going to keep you from doing the right thing. And, frankly, corporations have a duty to maximise profits 每 so they would be in violation of their shareholders if they were doing anything but.§"																																																			
"Three hundred million of the world＊s children live in areas with extreme air pollution, where toxic fumes are more than six times international guidelines, according to new research by . The study, using satellite data, is the first to make a global estimate of exposure and indicates that almost 90% of the world＊s children - 2 billion - live in places where outdoor air pollution exceeds World  Organisation (WHO) limits.Unicef warned the levels of global air pollution contributed to 600,000 child deaths a year 每 more than are caused by malaria and HIV/Aids combined. Children are far more vulnerable to air pollution, Unicef warned, pointing to enduring damage to health and the development of children＊s brain and urging nations attending a  next month to cut fossil fuel burning rapidly.※The magnitude of the danger air pollution poses is enormous,§ said Anthony Lake, Unicef＊s executive director. ※No society can afford to ignore air pollution. We protect our children when we protect the quality of our air. Both are central to our future.§ Air pollution is , according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), and , with levels of toxic air rising 8% in the last five years. More than 3 million people a year die as a result of outdoor air pollution 每 six every minute on average 每 and this is  as fast growing cities expand. Indoor air pollution, mainly from wood or dung stoves, causes another 3 million deaths a year.Children are especially at risk, the Unicef report says, because they breathe more rapidly than adults and the cell layer in their lungs is more permeable to pollutant particles. The tiny particles can also , which is less resistant in children, permanently harming  and their future prospects. Even the unborn are affected, as the particles inhaled by pregnant women can cross the placental barrier, injuring fetuses.Prof Jos Lelieveld, at the Max Planck Institute in Mainz, Germany, said the report was excellent: ※Air pollution is typically a problem in developing countries, where infants have little resistance due to poor nutrition and where health care is insufficient.§The Unicef study combined particle pollution data from a range of satellites with ground-level monitors to estimate the number of children in polluted areas. Of the 300 million exposed to levels of pollution six times over WHO limits, 220 million live in south Asia, where . Another 70 million children living with very toxic air live in east Asia, mainly in China. But more children are exposed to air pollution levels above the WHO limit in Africa - 520 million - than in east Asia.The air pollution crisis is worst in low and middle income nations, where 98% of cities do not meet WHO guidelines, but over half the cities in rich countries also fail to meet the guidelines. In Europe, 120 million children live in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds international limits, and 20 million suffer levels over double the limit.Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: ※In the UK, we know that children＊s health is being put at risk every day by unsafe levels of pollution in many of our towns and cities. At least 3,000  are located within illegal levels of pollution. Yet very few of these schools . It＊s time for the government to enact a new  to tackle this modern pollution problem and protect all our health.§In the report, Unicef urges all countries to cut air pollution by reducing fossil fuel burning in power plants and vehicles, which also helps tackle climate change. This double benefit has led to  in recent years. Tackling air pollution is also cost-effective: the  are more than $5tn a year.Unicef also recommends minimising children＊s exposure by ensuring sources of pollution such as busy roads and factories are not sited near schools and playgrounds and by the roll-out of cleaner cooking stoves."																																																			
"When the Daldykan river in Norilsk suddenly  recently, its appearance was so unsettling that one user quoted the  about God transforming the Nile into blood.Norilsk Nickel, the main employer in this industrial city 180 miles north of the Arctic Circle, initially denied any spill into the Daldykan 每 but later  that heavy rain had caused a filtration dam to flood into the river. The incident suggested that, despite Norilsk Nickel＊s efforts, environmental concerns are far from resolved in what has long been called Russia＊s most polluted city.As part of plans to clean up Norilsk＊s reputation, in June the  its : a 74-year-old enterprise that emitted 350,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide each year. But other plants in Norilsk have taken on the nickel factory＊s operations, while the final stages of production are being transferred to plants in the Murmansk region, which Norway has long  of sending ※death clouds§ of pollution across its border with Russia.Experts predict that in Norilsk, the health effects could linger for many years to come. ※There can be a lot of built-up harm [to people＊s health] ＃ It＊s naive to think that closing a factory will fix it,§ says Boris Revich, head of environmental quality and public health forecasting laboratory at the Russian Academy of Science＊s economic forecasting institute. ※It certainly will help, but it＊s not a cardinal solution to this problem.§Starting in 1935, thousands of gulag prisoners died building Norilsk 每 also one of the  每 next to mineral deposits in the mostly treeless, Arctic tundra. In February 1942, prisoners fired up the nickel factory＊s furnace for the first time amid temperatures of -47C, to make nickel for tank armour.By 2014, Norilsk Nickel  44% of the world＊s palladium, 14% of its platinum, 13% of its nickel and 2% of its copper 每 elements that end up in everything from cellphones to dishwashers to car radiators. While the copper factory impresses visitors with its immense size 每 huge urns pour molten metal, cranes and railcars rumble along tracks, moulds hiss under cooling water 每 it is a daunting reminder of the environmental risks posed to the city, and the surrounding region.By the end of a tour of the factory, I find I have developed a sudden cough. Locals here talk about the black or red snow, and the ※blue fog§ that causes an itch in the throat. ※When gases are coming out of the pipes, you feel it,§ says restaurant owner Eldar Aliyev. ※From copper it has a sweet taste; from nickel, a different taste. Now, though, you taste it less.§The Arctic branch of Norilsk Nickel emitted , most of it sulphur dioxide, which can harm the respiratory system and kill plants and trees.With the nickel factory located in the southern part of the city, the copper factory just to its north, and the Nadezhda metallurgical plant 12km to the east, Norilsk was caught between heavy industry no matter which way the wind blew. After a 2007 visit, the Blacksmith Institute declared Norilsk one of the .Sulphur dioxide in the air had exceeded the safe threshold limit in 9.3% of samples over the previous five years, Norilsk Nickel revealed at a 2015  of its plans to reduce emissions to within that limit. According to a report by Boris Revich in 2007, sulphur dioxide concentrations had at times been 40 times higher than the limit.According to Gennady Sveshnikov, acting head doctor of Norilsk＊s polyclinic, the city＊s rates of mortality, cancer and lung disease are no higher than in other regions in . He says its healthcare system is better than in other cities, but concedes that Norilsk＊s population is younger on average, with many retired workers leaving for the ※mainland§ and taking any health problems with them.But Revich says any analysis of the health effects of factory emissions is limited by a lack of objective pollution data and longitudinal studies following residents.The Blacksmith Institute reported that children who lived near the copper plant were twice as likely to become ill with ear, nose and throat diseases than those in other districts, and that premature births and late-term pregnancy complications were also frequent in the city. Revich＊s study found that blood illnesses were 44% higher, nervous system illnesses 38% higher, and bone and muscle system illnesses 28% higher among children in Norilsk than in the Krasnoyarsk region as a whole.Although a gas mask was reportedly put on the city＊s Lenin monument sometime in the 1970s, residents have rarely protested environmental conditions. ※Who is there to complain to? All the money comes from Norilsk Nickel,§ says Tatiana, a hairdresser who refused to give her last name.But in 2010, President Vladimir Putin did complain during a visit to Norilsk,  a ※significant increase in environmental fines§ if the plant wasn＊t modernised. By 2013, owner and chairman Vladimir Potanin, one of , had begun investments in environmental measures, including the gradual closure of the nickel factory. In exchange, the Russian government cancelled export customs on the company＊s nickel and copper for 2016. Norilsk Nickel plans to invest  (?3.5bn) in modernising manufacturing by 2020.※The situation is getting better, but it＊s no time to celebrate and not do anything,§ says Denis Koshevoi, a PhD candidate at the Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, who is researching pollution in Norilsk. ※The copper factory is only 2km from the city, and it also emits to the city.§Norilsk Nickel said emissions would be 15% lower after the nickel factory＊s closure and the modernisation of the Talnakh enrichment plant. According to deputy director for reconstruction and environment Viktor Ivanov, the company will install 100bn roubles of equipment to manufacture sulphur from emissions at the copper factory and the Nadezhda plant, reducing sulphur dioxide pollution by 75每80% by 2020. But the company also emits 50,000 to 70,000 tonnes of other pollutants annually, he admitted.Air concentrations of nickel and benzopyrene, both carcinogens, have exceeded annual threshold limits in Norilsk in previous years, as has copper. At Norilsk Nickel＊s 2015 public discussion, it admitted nickel was over the limit in 20.7% of samples, and copper in 45.9%.And as the incident with the red river showed, Norilsk＊s industry also pollutes local fishing grounds. Of 29.8 million cubic metres of waste water Norilsk Nickel emitted in 2015, only 5.18m were cleaned according to government standards, according to its yearly report. All samples taken in the Norilka river showed concentrations of copper, iron and oil products exceeding the threshold limit value, and all samples taken in the Talnakh river showed copper and cobalt concentrations over the limit. Revich says soil pollution is another concern.※It used to be that the smog was overwhelming; now things have gotten cleaner,§ says Mikhail Zabelin, a biologist at the Arctic Agriculture and Environment Institute. ※But no one thinks that everything is rosy. They need to minimise emissions even more.§"																																																			
"s an enforced child soldier, Rodrigue Katembo saw his little brother die and had to carry the news to his mother. Now 41, he remains on the frontline 每 but today he protects the extraordinary wildlife in the national parks of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from armed militias.It is exceptionally dangerous work: 160 park rangers have been killed protecting  in the last 15 years, outnumbered 10 to one by militias and poachers. Around the world, about  over the last decade. But Katembo, who is awarded the prestigious  on Monday, is resolute, despite the attacks he has endured and the risks he continues to run.※It is really worth it to make this sacrifice,§ he told the Guardian. ※I know it is among the most dangerous work in DRC, but I am working for the welfare of future generations.§ His goal is to protect the rainforests and savannahs of Congo＊s parks, and the endangered mountain gorillas, lions and elephants they contain, and build a sustainable way of life for the many thousands of people living there.Katembo has made heavy personal sacrifices in the fight against the corruption that helps fuel the destruction. In 2013, just days after stopping an oil-related development, he was arrested. ※I was tortured and put in jail for 17 days,§ he said, adding that he also suffered mock executions. ※That was a really difficult time for me and my family as we didn＊t know if I was going to die in prison or not.§ Katembo survived and in 2015 the company pursuing oil in Virunga, a Unesco world heritage site, . However, continuing death threats from poachers, armed rebels and illegal miners led to his transfer to Upemba national park, though even there he has to live apart from his family for their safety.The source of Katembo＊s courage and determination began with his love of the natural world: ※Since I was very young, I really wanted to become part of the wildlife authority of Congo.§The best moments in his dangerous job are in the bush, he says: ※Many times as a chief warden, you take your rangers on patrol. You look at tracks and follow the wildlife, but every time you do that you are amazed at the beauty of the wildlife of Congo. Every time you see new things and make new discoveries 每 it＊s marvellous.§Katembo lists his successes with pride: ※We saw the population of hippos in Virunga go from 500 to 1,700 in three to four years 每 that was a really important moment for me. In Upemba in 2015, we only had 54 zebra, we now have 72. We had no elephants inside the park, but now we have 68.§Katembo＊s early love of wildlife and desire to serve his war-torn country was derailed at the age of 14. ※One of the armed groups tricked me and said they were going to bring me to university,§ he says. ※In the end, I started to be a child soldier. Many of the youths that tried to run away were killed. But I stayed there for two years.§※I was then able to go home during some holidays,§ Katembo says. ※I had to tell my mother that my younger brother had been killed in front of my eyes. My mother really fought to try to stop me having to return and I was able to escape. My mother then did everything she could to pay for my schooling and thanks to her I was able to study.§Katembo joined the DRC wildlife authority in 2003, which funded further study, and he has risen fast. He says he takes strength from the teams he works with but also from the responsibility he bears: ※It is really important they trust me and see in me someone whose leadership is bringing them support and who is giving an example.§His work in Upemba is daunting. The park covers 1.75m hectares and contains spectacular wildlife, including leopards and the Katanga impala, found only there. But there are also gold, emeralds and  每 a highly valuable ore used in electronics - which draws illegal mining. Katembo has already closed down eight coltan mines and removed 1,400 small-scale miners.But the murderous Katanga Mai Mai militia have infiltrated the park, making the need for more resources even more urgent. Katembo has just 160 rangers, far short of the 400 needed, and a single patrol truck.Nonetheless, Katembo is not ready to back down from the fight. ※It is not the time to do something else. When we see how many [groups] are trying to destroy our protected areas, we cannot stop now. If I left, that would feel like a betrayal to the protections the wildlife and national parks deserve. I also need to ensure a new generation of young Congolese are there to take up the baton.§"																																																			
																																																			
"As the London Assembly transport committee  what Sadiq Khan and Transport for London (TfL) can do to reduce rising levels of road traffic congestion in London, bear in mind that the price of gridlock is not only paid in frustration and pollution. A  (pdf) of vehicle delays on Greater London＊s roads during 2014-15, published in May, estimated the financial cost of congestion by this measure to be an astonishing ?5.5bn a year.Let＊s wrap some context around that. London＊s economic output is reckoned by the  to be about ?364bn a year. The Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank has put the  at ?10m each. Others think it＊s higher, but even the Federation of Small Businesses＊ huge figure of  is dwarfed by the cost of congestion. In other words, congestion is doing major damage to the city＊s economy. And the frustration and pollution are adding to that cost because they make London less agreeable to function in. Speaking to the transport committee , Grant Davis, chairman of the  spoke of more and more his customers getting out of his taxi before reaching their destinations because his cab has simply stopped moving. Demand for the bus service has started to decline after years of increase, coinciding with slower speeds and worse reliability.Construction works, the proliferation of private hire vehicles and delivery vans, the halving of the congestion charge zone and a long-term loss of road space have all  to the growth of the problem over the past two years following a long period of general stability during which London has seen a big ※modal shift§ away from all forms of private transport, principally cars, towards public transport. Transport for London＊s  records that in 2000 34% of ※journey stages§ - the components of an excursion from one place to another - were undertaken on public transport compared with 43% by private vehicles. By 2014, the public transport figure had risen to 45% and the private transport figure had fallen to 32%.The pattern for ※trips§ - entire excursions within London - has followed a similar trend. Just 28% were taken by public transport in 2000 and 47% by private vehicle. But by 2014 both measures were running at 37%. Nearly all other journey stages and trips were done on foot, plus 2% by bicycle (see ). Car ownership too has been falling, in marked contrast with the rest of England and Wales. So has the volume of motor vehicle traffic in London as a whole according to both Department for Transport estimates of distances travelled in them and TfL＊s own traffic flow data ().

"The final day to ※§ on Sadiq Khan＊s plans for improving London＊s air quality is Friday, 29 July. Submissions can be accepted until one minute to midnight, so there＊s no time lose. Khan＊s main proposals, , are as follows:Khan also wants  for London (TfL) to require all new buses operating in London from 2018 to be hybrid or zero emission vehicles and produce plans for a diesel vehicle scrappage scheme in the hope that national government will take them up. He also favours supplying better information for Londoners about pollution levels in the city.These ideas have received a pretty warm welcome from environmentalists, including the Clean Air in London (CAL) campaign and Russell. They are recognised as representing a big advance on the more cautious and, some say,  Johnson took under  of European Union fines. But how far will Khan go? How far could and should he?CAL has given Khan a ※§ for his initiative, but still says ※it＊s not good enough§. Rather than fining vehicles for emission standard infractions, CAL wants a straight ban on all diesel motors in high pollution areas. ※The so-called ULEZ is nothing of the sort,§ they say and argue that it is ※mathematically impossible§ for London to comply with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels until at least 2025 unless diesel is outlawed.This view is shared in a new  (IPPR), which says ※it is likely that diesel cars will have to be completely phased out on London＊s road over the next decade§ in order to comply with legal and WHO NO2 limits and WHO limits for ※particulate matter§ - microscopic bits of soot and dirt generated by motor vehicles. CAL also calls for a simplification of what could end up as an array of overlapping emission charging schemes into a single, London-wide one.When Khan launched his consultation at Great Ormond Street Hospital earlier this month, I asked him about a diesel ban. Why not just do it and make a really dramatic difference to air quality right away? Or was part of the thinking on the ULEZ scheme that it would bring in some handy cash for TfL? He replied that his plans were ※cost-neutral§ and encouraged me to submit ideas to the consultation. This was touching, though I imagine others will have covered that ground better than I could.As for a fully unified, pan-London emissions charging regime, it＊s understood that Khan＊s officers regard it as a very interesting idea and have been looking at something similar in California. It would be a long-term goal, but still worthy of examination in the mayor＊s consultation. As I write, you have just over 24 hours to help make that happen. Start from .

"Last year  were captured from the wild in Zimbabwe and flown by plane to China. The elephants 每 some reported to be as young as three 每 were dispersed to a number of zoos throughout the country, including the Shanghai Wild Animal Park, the Beijing Wildlife Park and the Hangzhou Safari Park, according to conservationists.But what are their lives like now?This week, 12 of the calves went on show at the Shanghai park. The  for the zoo says their average age is four. The photos there were reviewed by Yolanda Pretorius, vice-chair of the , who commented: ※Overall their body condition seems to be slightly below average but it does not look as if they are starving. One of the elephants has temporal gland secretions and I am not sure whether this is a good or bad sign. In the wild, elephants mostly secrete from their temporal glands when they get excited.§Meanwhile, recent photos and video said to show some of the elephants currently in Hangzhou reveal the animals behind bars and walking on concrete floors. The images were obtained by the animal welfare advocate Chunmei Hu, former secretary general of the Chinese Green Development and Endangered Species Fund.The video has been reviewed by elephant experts, including , co-founder of the Kenya-based  and renowned specialist on elephant behaviour. ※They appear rather listless,§ she says. ※Perhaps waiting for something, but without much attention＃ Their housing is totally unstimulating. They look like sad, locked-up little kids.§Aside from these snippets of evidence, there is little information on the conditions faced by these once-wild elephants. There is no official figures for how many elephants were sent to each zoo, although conservationists believe 17 of the calves ended up in Shanghai, 15 in Beijing and six in Hangzhou.※It is heartwrenching not knowing the current fate of these animals,§ says , wildlife campaign manager at Humane Society International. ※It＊s like knowing that someone 每 or children in this case, since they are baby elephants 每 is in danger or trapped in misery for the rest of their lives but there is nothing you can do about it.§ on elephants in Asia said that 47 zoos in China together hold at least 200 captive elephants 每 but the precise situation is ※unclear§. Owners are supposed to register births, deaths, trade and movements, but the rule isn＊t enforced or enforceable: ※It appears that registration relies on voluntary compliance unless it becomes necessary in the interest of the owner.§In 2012 a shipment of eight elephants was sent to China from Zimbabwe. Distressing  was shot of one of those reportedly sent to Taiyuan zoo. In the video, the sickly-appearing calf seems to be trying to smash his way out of his confines. Named Xiaofei, he still lives alone at the Taiyuan zoo, according to Hu.She believes that the other elephants imported into China that year are dead.Compared with the trade in ivory, which has led to the slaughter of tens of thousands of elephants in Africa, the live trade in elephants receives far less attention. This is probably because it is legal, sanctioned by Cites, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species.A review of the Cites database shows many other wild elephant exports that took place over the last few years. Seven elephants were shipped from Tanzania to China in 2011, and two from Tanzania to South Korea. In 2011 and 2012 Monaco sold a total of 12 elephants, originally from Zimbabwe, to Denmark and the Czech Republic. They were probably performing animals. African elephants are a regular feature of the Monte Carlo International Circus.In 2012, Namibia reported exporting 18 elephants to Mexico (Mexico says that only nine arrived), while in 2013 .In July 2015, 27 wild elephants were shipped to Chinese zoos from Zimbabwe. Hu believes that one of those elephants is dead and that the others aren＊t on public display. In September of the same year,  that 24 of the elephants were at the Changlong Breeding Center of Rare and Endangered Species of Wild Animals and Plants would be used for research.Last year, 17 elephants were sent from Swaziland to three zoos in the US. Initially, there were to be 18, but one  before leaving Swaziland.One of the conservationists＊ concerns about the live trade is that there isn＊t an independent body that adequately oversees these animals once they are captured and ultimately exported.Cites allows live animals to be sent to ※appropriate and acceptable destinations§. But the decision about what is ※appropriate and acceptable§ is left to the importing country＊s scientific authority. It has to be satisfied that the animal is suitably housed and cared for, while the country of export must be satisfied that trade promotes conservation of elephants in the wild. That＊s not good enough for Keith Lindsay, a collaborating researcher with the Amboseli Trust for Elephants in Kenya: ※There currently is under Cites no independent, objective mechanism of oversight or monitoring of the welfare conditions of elephants (or any animals) when they enter the live export chain.§ The minimal welfare standards that do exist are left entirely to the authorities that are already involved in the import and export. ※If both countries say they are happy with the welfare aspects of the trade,§ Lindsay says, ※no matter how genuinely inadequate, there is nothing anyone else can say.§What is needed, Lindsay argues, are Cites resolutions that specify stringent welfare conditions for the entire chain of live trade, including the eventual captivity: ※The latter should replicate in every way the conditions of the native ecosystem, and there should be no impacts on the populations from which the animals are taken.§ There was an effort at the most recent Cites conference in Johannesburg to stop the live trade in elephants, led by the , a group of 29 African nations. But China, the EU, the US and Zimbabwe did not support the resolution and it failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority to pass into law.Meanwhile, rumours continue to circulate that China has a standing order for 100-200 elephant calves from Zimbabwe. And according to Jess Isden of Elephants for Africa, a conservation and research organization based in Botswana, recent captures in Hwange National Park are already damaging elephant behaviour. Large numbers of elephants have begun migrating into Botswana from Hwange, some making it as far as the Botetei river, hundreds of miles from their home range.※The research is not yet conclusive,§ she says, ※but these animals, mostly young males, could be moving out of Hwange in direct response to the violent captures going on in Hwange.§As for the elephants most recently sent to China from Zimbabwe, it is unclear if they will be forced to perform, but it appears likely in some cases.China＊s State Forestry Administration issued a directive in July 2010 to end acts of cruelty in safari parks, including a ban on animal performances. However, Hu claims, in many cases these rules are being ignored. Just weeks ago, she says she photographed elephants, tigers, macaques and bears being forced to perform tricks at the Shanghai Wild Animal Park.Photos of elephants said to have been taken at Hangzhou Safari Park in June 2016 also showed elephants performing tricks, including lifting people with their trunks and standing on stools. For Scott Blais, founder of the , who has worked with elephants for decades, such ※tricks§ are often taught by brutal means: ※Elephant experts and advocates across the globe oppose the horrific training these elephants will endure. These practices are well known to be detrimental, violent and grossly inhumane, causing immeasurable psychological and emotional trauma.§Efforts to ask Zimbabwean and Chinese Cites authorities about the condition of the elephants recently shipped to China met with no response.

"The critically endangered Indochinese tiger has been found to be breeding in a Thai jungle, providing hope for a subspecies whose total population may number only a couple of hundred. authorities in Thailand, along with two international wildlife organisations, released photographs of new tiger cubs in the country＊s east.The images support a scientific survey that confirmed the existence of the world＊s second breeding population. The other breeding ground is in the Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuary in western .The Department of National Parks of Thailand, the anti-trafficking group  and , a wildcat conservation organisation, said only 221 Indochinese tigers were estimated to remain in just two Asian countries, Thailand and neighbouring Myanmar.The group said it had been tracking the tiger population since 1999 and, for the first time last year, camera traps had photographed six cubs from four mothers.※Poaching for the illegal wildlife trade stands as the gravest threat to the survival of the tiger, whose numbers in the wild have dwindled from 100,000 a century ago to 3,900 today,§ the agencies said in a statement.It noted the tigers＊ ※remarkable resilience given wildlife poaching and illegal rosewood logging§ in the eastern jungle.Indochinese tigers are smaller than the better-known Siberian or the Bengal subspecies, which is the most numerous with a total population .Tigers, which once ranged across much of the region, are all but extinct in southern China, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and much of Myanmar. Although there is no evidence of their medicinal effect, tiger bones are used in traditional Asian remedies such as ※health tonics§.Alan Rabinowitz, the chief executive officer of Panthera, said in a video call from New York that Thailand had ※one of the best-protected and best tiger areas left in the world§.※Thailand has shown that you can protect tigers and bring them back. They can do this now in the eastern forest complex as they have done in the western forest complex,§ he added. on its website that only 8% of tiger sites had a confirmed breeding population, meaning the photos were ※a huge 每 and rare 每 win§.It said: ※A breeding population here means that the future of this subspecies is less precarious and could potentially even expand 每 tigers here could disperse and repopulate Cambodia and Laos, where no breeding populations persist.§"																																																			
"The number of animal cruelty investigations by the RSPCA jumped by nearly 5% last year to more than 400 a day, according to figures released by the animal welfare charity.In its annual  the RSPCA said it had investigated almost 150,000 cases in 2016. Calls to its 24-hour cruelty hotline rose by nearly 4%, averaging one every 27 seconds.Dermot Murphy, assistant director of the RSPCA inspectorate, said he thought that rather than the figures representing a rise in cruelty they suggested that more people were sharing abuse images on social media, leading to more investigations.He said: ※I believe that the figures from last year show that we＊re not becoming more cruel, but that people are simply less willing to stand by and do nothing if they think an animal is suffering. People are increasingly likely to share images or footage on their social media accounts of animals they believe are not being cared for properly, while many will see material their friends have shared and then contact us about them.§A total of 149,604 complaints of animal abuse were investigated by the RSPCA in 2016, including the case of Reo, a nine-year-old German shepherd who was whimpering in agony when she was found, suffering from open wounds on her ears, jaw and eye. Her owner was banned from keeping animals for life after being prosecuted by the RSPCA. The charity said the dog was now thriving in her new home.Other cases highlighted in the RSPCA report include:Murphy said: ※It never fails to shock me when I look back on the extreme instances of animal cruelty the RSPCA has been called upon to investigate. It continues to outrage and sadden me that people can be capable of such deliberate brutality towards animals. But equally it drives me on to ensure that perpetrators of animal cruelty are put before the courts.§The majority of complaints received by the RSPCA were about the welfare of dogs (84,994), followed by cats (36,156) and equines (19,530).The highest number of complaints investigated were in Greater London (11,812), West Yorkshire (7,920) and Greater Manchester (7,708). Murphy said: ※People might see these figures as a negative, and I certainly take no satisfaction from knowing that any animal has suffered. What I do take pride in is knowing that because of the RSPCA＊s intervention we have prevented many more animals from suffering at the hands of those whom we have successfully investigated and brought before the courts.§"																																																			
"hen I rafted the Franklin in the 1970s, I knew the campaign to save that spectacular river, despite local support for damming it, would become one to test that generation. In 2017, stopping the Adani coal mine is a campaign to test this generation of Australians.In 40 years time people will be talking about the campaign to stop Adani like they now talk about the Franklin. ※Where were you and what did you do?§ they will ask. This is the environmental issue of our times and, for one, the  is at stake. The Adani corporation＊s dirty coalmine is an impending disaster with effects which will reach far beyond Australia.Everywhere I go people ask me about it. They cannot believe that, at a time when we should be drastically cutting the pollution which drives global warming, Australia＊s authorities would even consider building the world＊s biggest export coalmine.Lending Mr Adani, a billionaire,  to carry this project into reality would be the political mistake of the decade. The Turnbull government would be literally paying Adani to ride roughshod over Indigenous rights, to contaminate the groundwater of the Galilee Basin, to consign threatened species to the dustbin of history and to increase the already disastrous impact of coral death worldwide.Thirteen community groups  at Parliament House in Canberra this week. The alliance is building the biggest movement in Australia＊s environmental history to stop the Adani coalmine in its tracks, to transform Australia to a renewable energy future and to end taxpayer handouts for polluting projects. The mining and burning of coal threatens our way of life and Australians know it. Polls show a big majority understands that burning fossil fuels spurs global warming and its impacts such as heatwaves, bushfires, floods, droughts and more severe and frequent storms. On Monday, the prime minister, , told the House of Representatives about another disastrous threat: rising sea levels around Australia and the Pacific.Coal kills more than just coral. In this country workers are  and in the Adani corporation＊s India more than 100,000 people die of the polluting effects of burning fossil fuels every year. The proposed monster mine in central  would spew 4.6bn tonnes more carbon pollution into Earth＊s atmosphere already overloaded with greenhouse gases. The mine would end up a hole five times larger than Sydney Harbour. It would suck up billions of litres of ground and surface water each year. It would uproot critical habitat and is likely to kill off the beautiful, endangered Black-throated finch. It would accelerate the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef and the 67,000 jobs the reef sustains.The Adani coalmine comes with a domino effect: it would unlock one of the biggest untouched coal reserves left on Earth. There is a clutch of other mines that would use Adani＊s railway infrastructure to get their projects off the ground. Adani is the key to unlocking a global climate catastrophe and all this would be against the wishes of the area＊s traditional owners.Every day, inaction on climate change is making our unique planet less viable. Australia should rapidly cut carbon emissions and transition to clean energy, embracing all the economic and health benefits that transition will bring including more than a million new jobs by mid-century.In promoting the mine, Turnbull is hiding behind the drug dealer＊s defence 每 ※if I don＊t do it, someone else will§. This begs the moral responsibility to the future of Australia which is one of the wealthiest communities in human history. There is no excuse in pointing to other malefactors.The  brings significant people power to oppose the Adani mine. Already the alliance represents 1.5 million Australians. There are millions more people all over this country who oppose this dangerous venture.Just like in the Franklin campaign, this will be a passionate, determined and unstoppable popular movement. This is an issue of conscience. Besides immediate absurdities like the prospect of $1bn of taxpayers＊ money going to fund the mine, Australians are deeply concerned about the world their grandchildren will inherit and view the crisis unfolding for the Great Barrier Reef with escalating trepidation.Adani＊s political backers will continue to underestimate this community feeling at their own peril. Those who say the mine can＊t be stopped have forgotten the unbeatable power of a majority of people standing up for what they believe in."																																																			
"nches above the seafloor of Sydney＊s Cabbage Tree Bay, with the proximity made possible by several millimetres of neoprene and a scuba diving tank, I＊m just about eyeball to eyeball with this creature: an Australian giant cuttlefish.Even allowing for the magnifying effects of the mask snug across my nose, it must be about 60cm (two feet) long, and the peculiarities that abound in the  family, that includes octopuses and squid, are the more striking writ so large.Its body 每 shaped around an internal surfboard-like shell, tailing off into a fistful of tentacles 每 has the shifting colour of velvet in light, and its W-shaped pupils lend it a stern expression. I don＊t think I＊m imagining some recognition on its part. The question is, of what?It was an encounter like this one 每 ※at exactly the same place, actually, to the foot§ 每 that first prompted  to think about these most other of minds. An Australian academic philosopher, he＊d recently been appointed a professor at Harvard.While snorkelling on a visit home to Sydney in about 2007, he came across a giant cuttlefish. The experience had a profound effect on him, establishing an unlikely framework for his own study of philosophy, first at Harvard and then the City University of New York.The cuttlefish hadn＊t been afraid 每 it had seemed as curious about him as he was about it. But to imagine cephalopods＊ experience of the world as some iteration of our own may sell them short, given the many millions of years of separation between us 每 nearly twice as many as with humans and any other vertebrate (mammal, bird or fish).Cephalopods＊ high-resolution camera eyes resemble our own, but we otherwise differ in every way. Octopuses in particular are peculiarly other. The majority of their 500m neurons are in their arms, which can not only touch but smell and taste 每 they quite literally have minds of their own.That it was possible to observe some kind of subjective experience, a sense of self, in cephalopods fascinated Godfrey-Smith. How that might differ to humans＊ is the subject of his book , published this month by HarperCollins.In it Godfrey-Smith charts his path through philosophical problems as guided by cephalopods 每 in one case quite literally, when he recounts an octopus taking his collaborator by hand on a 10-minute tour to its den, ※as if he were being led across the sea floor by a very small eight-legged child§.Charming anecdotes like this abound in Godfrey-Smith＊s book, particularly about captive octopuses frustrating scientists＊ attempts at observation.A 1959 paper detailed an attempt at the Naples Zoological Station to teach three octopuses to pull and release a lever in exchange for food. Albert and Bertram performed in a ※reasonably consistent§ manner, but one named Charles tried to drag a light suspended above the water into the tank; squirted water at anyone who approached; and prematurely ended the experiment when he broke the lever.Most aquariums that have attempted to keep octopuses have tales to tell of their great escapes 每 even their overnight raids of neighbouring tanks for food. Godfrey-Smith writes of animals learning to turn off lights by directing jets of water at them, short-circuiting the power supply. Elsewhere octopuses have plugged their tanks＊ outflow valves, causing them to overflow.This apparent problem-solving ability has led cephalopods (particularly octopuses, because they＊ve been studied more than squid or cuttlefish) to be recognised as intelligent. Half a billion neurons put octopuses close to the range of dogs and their brains are large relative to their size, both of which offer biologists a rough guide to brainpower.In captivity, they have learned to navigate simple mazes, solve puzzles and open screw-top jars, while wild animals have been observed stacking rocks to protect the entrances to their dens, and hiding themselves .But that＊s also reflective of their dexterity: an animal with fewer than eight legs may accomplish less but not necessarily because it is more stupid. There＊s no one metric by which to measure intelligence 每 some markers, such as tool use, were settled on simply because they were evident in humans.※I think it＊s a mistake to look for a single, definitive thing,§ says Godfrey-Smith. ※Octopuses are pretty good at sophisticated kinds of learning, but how good it＊s hard to say, in part because they＊re so hard to experiment on. You get a small amount of animals in the lab and some of them refuse to do anything you want them to do 每 they＊re just too unruly.§He sees that curiosity and opportunism 每 their ※mischief and craft§, as a Roman natural historian put it in the third century AD 每 as characteristic of octopus intelligence.Their great escapes from captivity, too, reflect an awareness of their special circumstances and their ability to adapt to them. A 2010 experiment confirmed anecdotal reports that cephalopods are able to recognise 每 and like or dislike 每 individual humans, even those that are dressed identically.It is no stretch to say they have personalities. But the inconsistencies of their behaviour, combined with their apparent intelligence, presents an obvious trap of anthropomorphism. It＊s ※tempting§, admits Godfrey-Smith, to attribute their many enigmas to ※some clever, human-like explanation§.Opinions of octopus intelligence consequently vary within the scientific community. A fundamental precept of animal psychology, coined by the 19th-century British psychologist C Lloyd Morgan, says no behaviour should be attributed to a sophisticated internal process if it can be explained by a simpler one.That is indicative of a general preference for simplicity of hypotheses in science, says Godfrey-Smith, that as a philosopher he is not convinced by. But scientific research across the board has become more outcome-driven as a result of the cycle of funding and publishing, and he is in the privileged position of being able to ask open-ended questions.※That＊s a great luxury, to be able to roam around year after year, putting pieces together very slowly.§That process, set in motion by his chance encounter with a cuttlefish a decade ago, is ongoing. Now back based in Australia, lecturing at the University of Sydney, Godfrey-Smith says his study of cephalopods is increasingly influencing his professional life (and his personal one: , the 2016 film about first contact with ※cephalopod-esque§ aliens, was a ※good, inventive film§, he says, though the invaders ※were a bit more like jellyfish§).When philosophers ponder the mind-body problem, none poses quite such a challenge as that of the octopus＊s, and the study of cephalopods gives some clues to questions about the origins of our own consciousness.Our last common ancestor existed 600m years ago and was thought to resemble a flattened worm, perhaps only millimetres long. Yet somewhere along the line, cephalopods developed high-resolution, camera eyes 每 as did we, entirely independently. ※A camera eye, with a lens that focuses an image on a retina 每 we＊ve got it, they＊ve got it, and that＊s it,§ says Godfrey-Smith. That it was ※arrived at twice§ in such vastly different animals gives pause for thought about the process of evolution, as does their inexplicably short life spans: most species of cephalopods live only about one to two years.※When I learned that, I was just amazed 每 it was such a surprise,§ says Godfrey-Smith, somewhat sadly. ※I＊d just gotten to know the animals. I thought, ＆I＊ll be visiting these guys for ages.＊ Then I thought, ＆No, I won＊t, they＊ll be dead in a few months.＊§It＊s perhaps the biggest paradox presented by an animal that has no shortage of contradictions: ※A really big brain and a really short life.§ From an evolutionary perspective, Godfrey-Smith explains, it does not give a good return on investment.※It＊s a bit like spending a vast amount of money to do a PhD, and then you＊ve got two years to make use of it ... the accounting is really weird.§One possibility is that an octopus＊s brain needs to be powerful just to preside over such an unwieldy form, in the same way that a computer would need a state-of-the-art processor to perform a large volume of complex tasks.※I mean, the body is so hard to control, with eight arms and every possible inch an elbow.§ But that explanation doesn＊t account for the flair, even playfulness with which they apply it.※They behave smartly, they do all these novel, inventive things 每 that line of reasoning doesn＊t resolve things, by any stretch,§ says Godfrey-Smith. ※There＊s still a somewhat mysterious element there.§"																																																			
"Every year, 18 million hectares of tree cover 每  每 is cut down, releasing millions of tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.

"hen it comes to confronting climate change, the world＊s cities are proving that there＊s strength in unity. The historic climate agreement reached in Paris in December, which was approved by nearly all of the world＊s nations, was made possible in part by the progress that cities have made by working together.Today, the two biggest coalitions of cities in the world 每 the EU-based Covenant of Mayors and the UN-backed Compact of Mayors 每 are forming an alliance to link more than 600 million city dwellers in the fight against climate change.Cities are key to solving the climate change challenge. They account for most of the , and mayors often have control over the largest sources. Just as importantly, mayors have strong incentives to attack those sources because steps that reduce carbon also improve public health and strengthen local economies. Clean air is increasingly a factor business leaders weigh when deciding where to invest. Cities can also act quickly to confront climate change, without the political and bureaucratic hurdles that often hold back national governments.By sharing smart strategies, cities of all sizes have led the way in addressing climate change, and as a result, the UN has given cities an official role in international climate diplomacy for the first time. In the European Union as well, cities are increasingly seen as crucial allies in the transition to a low-carbon economy.Our new alliance, now called the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, will provide unprecedented support for city efforts and accelerate progress against climate change in a number of ways, including: The Global Covenant will link more than 7,100 cities, representing more than 600 million people, in one unified effort to address the causes and impacts of climate change. Cities will speak with one clear, coordinated voice, sending a strong signal to national governments that they are committed to this fight and to assisting one another. It will also help us expand and recruit new members, with a focus on parts of the world where cities are growing most rapidly, including Africa, Latin America and south-east Asia.The Global Covenant will enable cities to collect and report climate data in a standardised, comparable way, allowing them to track their progress and hold one another accountable. It will also allow the UN to identify the contributions that cities are making toward the goals set in Paris, which will underscore how important cities are to meeting them.Modernising infrastructure networks can be costly, and city governments are increasingly turning to private investors to help finance such projects. But, especially in developing nations, many cities lack credit ratings and cannot access international capital markets. To help remedy this, the Global Covenant will feature an advisory group of financial institutions that will offer guidance to cities. The goal is to direct more capital to low-carbon urban infrastructure that will generate economic returns. One of the best steps national governments can take to fight climate change is to empower their cities with the tools and autonomy they need to act. Some cities aren＊t able to borrow money on their own. Others don＊t have the authority to write their own building codes or energy efficiency regulations. Others lack control over mass transit. The more cities are given control over their own operations, the more progress nations will be able to make reducing emissions 每 which will incentivise more national governments to empower their cities.In the fight against climate change, cities are where the action is. The new Global Covenant of Mayors is a historic milestone for the global community of cities, and it will go a long way toward ensuring that the nations of the world are able to meet 每 and exceed 每 the goals they set in Paris."																																																			
"The UK has no policies in place to meet more than half of the carbon emission cuts required by law by 2030, the government＊s official advisers warned on Thursday, the same day . The advisers also warned that the UK＊s Brexit vote had thrown some EU-linked climate policies into doubt.The  said emissions from electricity generation were falling fast, but that pollution from transport was rising and that action on cutting carbon emissions from homes had gone backwards.The alert comes the day after energy secretary Amber Rudd said the UK＊s , which she said is a ※serious long-term risk to our economic and national security§. The energy industry, including the National Grid, has also warned that  for customers and lower energy security for the nation. The CCC said that uncertainty over climate policy had delayed projects and increased costs even before the .The government went some way to reassuring investors by announcing on Thursday that it had accepted the advice of the CCC to cut emissions , compared to 1990. But Matthew Bell, CCC chief executive, said progress to date had been mixed. National carbon emissions have fallen by over 4.5% a year since 2012, but almost entirely due to  and , with virtually no reductions in the rest of the economy.※In those other areas, policy has either changed or gone backwards,§ Bell said. ※Buildings are probably the biggest gap right now, where we called very clearly in 2015 for a new strategy for low-carbon heating and efficiency efficiency. The best way to keep consumers＊ bills low and to tackle climate change is to make sure houses are properly insulated.§However, the CCC found the rate of installing  and the government . ※The last thing we need is to be building homes we know we are going to have to retrofit in 10-15 years time, because that will inevitably be more expensive,§ Bell said. On Wednesday,  it was cutting support for energy efficiency from ?870m to ?640m after 2017.Before the EU referendum,  by the end of 2016 to plug the gaps identified by the CCC and . But the political turmoil following the Brexit vote is set to make this more difficult to deliver.Barry Gardiner, Labour＊s shadow energy and climate change secretary, said: ※Today＊s report sends a red alert that the Tories＊ energy policies are dangerously inadequate and are sending the UK woefully off track to meet our climate targets. The Conservatives＊  over the past year have opened up a 50% shortfall to meet our carbon budgets beyond 2030.§ He said an emissions reduction plan in 2011 had failed to plug gaps identified at that time.A spokeswoman for the Department of  and Climate Change said: ※We have already made great strides towards our target of an 80% reduction by 2050 but there remains work to do. We are investing in innovation to secure cheap and clean energy that our families and businesses can rely on in the long term.§Sue Armstrong Brown, at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: ※Yesterday, Amber Rudd was unequivocal that a tough stance on climate change will be an essential quality in the next Conservative leader. The CCC＊s report today makes clear that a robust emissions reduction plan will be the first test of that leadership.§ Bell said the nation＊s carbon targets were set in UK law by the climate change act and are not at all linked to EU legislation. But he added: ※What is undoubtedly the case is that a lot of the mechanisms we were using to tackle climate change were linked to the EU, like the EU emissions trading scheme that governs the power sector and heavy industry and emissions standards for vehicles. That is now thrown into doubt, and those were relatively efficient ways of trying to achieve emissions reductions.§※So the question is, post-Brexit, how do we ensure that we continue to be able to pursue climate change policies as efficiently as possible,§ Bell said. ※That is certainly an added complexity we did not have before.§ The CCC will now examine the impacts of Brexit in detail but Bell said: ※In general, reductions in your ability to trade is likely to increase costs.§Brexit might also present some opportunities for better climate policies, he said, for example in how the farming subsidies are used: ※Arguably, after the vote, the government has even more control over low carbon policy.§Some of the strongest criticism in the CCC report was of the  to spur the development of carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), which will be needed to trap and bury emissions.  and others have warned that tackling climate change .※We know CCS is a crucial component of meeting our ultimate 2050 objective§ of an 80% cut in emissions, Bell said, adding the cancellation was a big setback and that a new plan was urgently needed. He said CCS was also an opportunity for the UK, which has expertise and storage potential in its North Sea oil and gas industry: ※The UK may even in future be earning money from CCS.§"																																																			
"A month into his presidency,  (43% approve, 51% disapprove). Congress has a minus-50 approval rating, and the Republican Party has a minus-14 favorability rating. All are facing widespread protests, marches, and public resistance. Hundreds of concerned constituents have been  held by Republican Congressmen, like this one with Tom McClintock (R-CA):His constituents asked McClintock about the current hot-button issues: repealing Obamacare, the border wall, the Muslim ban, and climate change.The first three topics have strong support from the Republican base, but they＊re unpopular among most of the rest of Americans. That＊s why Trump＊s approval is held afloat by Republican support (about 85% approve), while only 35% of independents and fewer than 10% of  view him favorably. In fact, they view these policies so unfavorably that there are constant mass protests. And then there＊s this:Trump and the Republican Party need an issue and a policy that has strong support among all Americans.  and a carbon tax fit the bill perfectly. have shown that Trump voters support taking action to address climate change.It＊s also important to note that  in 2016; 28% voted for Hillary Clinton, and 40% didn＊t vote at all. In , Larry Hamilton at the University of New Hampshire found that 48% of Trump voters think renewable energy should be a higher priority, as do 63每100% from the other groups, including 84% of non-voters. Donald Trump is the president of all Americans, and Americans want climate action.A group of Republican elder statesmen in the Climate Leadership Council recently visited the White House to pitch a revenue-neutral carbon tax policy.  for liberals and conservatives alike 每 a true bipartisan compromise. It would tax carbon pollution, which would cause fuel and energy prices to rise, but 100% of the revenue would be returned to taxpayers via a periodic (monthly or quarterly) rebate check to offset those costs. And .It＊s a tough sell for Republicans in Congress, who rely upon campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry. However, President Trump isn＊t beholden to fossil fuel interests. Additionally, many Republican policymakers want to take action to protect the climate. They understand the science, the risks that climate change poses to future generations, and frankly . But they＊re . Were Trump to support a carbon tax, it would provide cover for congressional Republicans to follow his lead.  in the state of Washington in the 2016 election. Those behind the proposition insulted environmental justice groups rather than making the case that . Generally speaking, liberals prefer to spend tax revenue on programs to help people and accelerate the transition to a green economy. But low-income households spend a bigger chunk of their income on fuel and energy, so a carbon tax disproportionately impacts them. However, if the revenue is rebated equally to all taxpayers - as the Climate Leadership Council proposed - poorer Americans actually benefit from the carbon tax.Congressional Democrats are on board with this policy, as are a number of Congressional Republicans, at least in private meetings. And a majority of Americans 每 including Trump voters 每 want the government to take action to address climate change. Even though many of those conservatives are unconvinced by climate science, they＊re willing to tax and/or regulate carbon pollution . Even .Congressional Republicans  hate government regulations, including EPA carbon pollution regulations.

However, we can＊t afford four to eight years of delayed climate action, so replacing those hampered EPA regulations with a robust revenue-neutral, small government, free market carbon tax would be a good deal for both the left and the right.President Trump could make it happen by voicing his support for the policy. He would go down in history as a hero 每 the president who was able to broker a tremendous deal between Republicans and Democrats to protect the climate for future generations during a time of extreme partisanship. It would be a shocking move that most Americans 每 including most  每 would love and support.Alternatively, Trump could continue supporting policies that are only favored by conservative voters, which would keep his approval ratings in the red. Mass protests would continue, his administration would take action to worsen the climate for future generations, and Trump would go down in history as an unpopular, shortsighted president who left America and the planet a much worse place.The question is, with people like Steve Bannon, Scott Pruitt, and   whispering in his ear, will Donald Trump be able to recognize and make this great deal?"																																																			
"The growing gulf between laboratory tests and real world air pollution from cars is hampering efforts to cut the toxic air that kills millions of people a year worldwide, a leading expert has warned.The UN admitted on Tuesday that the global response to air pollution is not up to scratch, after it was  (WHO) that harmful airborne particulates had risen by 8% in cities around the world.Better vehicle emissions standards are seen as a crucial way to cut that pollution. Since , campaigners and governments have raised concerns about the sometimes huge discrepancies between emissions in lab tests compared to those on the road.※Most worrying is [that] the gap between what we find in the lab and on the ground is growing,§ Rob de Jong, a transport expert at the UN Environment Programme, said at an environmental summit of more than 170 countries in Nairobi.※Laboratory test results are increasingly unreliable or not reflective of vehicles. This gap is very worrisome because it＊s eating away at the progress we are making.§A  showed 97% emitted more nitrogen oxide pollution than the official limit, with many producing at least six times the limit.But de Jong said that he did not think the sort of deliberate cheating undertaken by VW 每 separate to the gap between test results and the real world 每 was widespread among carmakers. ※The majority I think are still in line with what is asked of them,§ he said.A new UN report, , identified cleaner cooking stoves, better vehicle standards, greater use of renewable energy for power generation, more electric cars, public transport and controls on waste burning as key ways to cut air pollution, which is estimated to cause more than 7 million premature deaths annually.※There is a global and increasing pandemic. The global response is not yet up to speed to turn that increase into a decrease,§ said de Jong, of the 8% rise in pollution reported by the WHO.※Wherever you live on this planet, air quality is something that needs our attention,§ said Achim Steiner, Unep＊s executive director, who added that the WHO data was a reminder that , let alone tackle it.Steiner announced that UNEP was installing seven low-cost air pollution monitors in Nairobi, where it is headquartered, developed with technology companies around the world, which will cost less than $2,000 each rather than the $100,000 for a similar, conventional monitoring station."																																																			
"When the gargantuan  slips out of Southampton docks on Sunday afternoon on its first commercial voyage, the 16-deck-high floating city will switch off its auxiliary engines, fire up its three giant diesels and head to the open sea.But while the 6,780 passengers and 2,100 crew on the largest cruise ship in the world wave goodbye to England, many people left behind in Southampton say they will be glad to see it go. They complain that  is getting worse every year as cruising becomes the fastest growing sector of the mass tourism industry and as ships get bigger and bigger.The Harmony, owned by Royal Caribbean, has two four-storey high 16-cylinder W?rtsil? engines which would, at full power, each burn 1,377 US gallons of fuel an hour, or about 66,000 gallons a day of some of the most polluting diesel fuel in the world.In port, and close to US and some European coasts, the Harmony must burn low sulphur fuel or use abatement technologies. But, says Colin MacQueen, who lives around 400 yards from the docks and is a member of new environment group Southampton Clean Air, the fumes from cruise liners and bulk cargo ships are ※definitely§ contributing to Southampton＊s highly polluted air.※We can smell, see and taste it. These ships are like blocks of flats. Sometimes there are five or more in the docks at the same time. The wind blows their pollution directly into the city and as far we can tell, there is no monitoring of their pollution. We are pushing for them to use shore power but they have resisted.§※The liners pollute, but the road traffic that they and the cargo ships generate is also huge,§ he adds. Royal Caribbean, the US owners of the Harmony of the Seas, said that the latest and most efficient pollution control systems were used and that the ship met all legal requirements. Industry body Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) added that companies had ※invested significantly over the last decade to develop new technologies to help reduce air emissions§.But marine pollution analysts in Germany and Brussels said that such a large ship would probably burn at least 150 tonnes of fuel a day, and emit more sulphur than several million cars, more NO2 gas than all the traffic passing through a medium-sized town and more particulate emissions than thousands of London buses.According to leading independent German pollution analyst Axel Friedrich, a single large cruise ship will emit over five tonnes of NOX emissions, and 450kg of ultra fine particles a day. Bill Hemmings, marine expert at Brussels-based  and Environment group said: ※These ships burn as much fuel as whole towns. They use a lot more power than container ships and even when they burn low sulphur fuel, it＊s 100 times worse than road diesel.§※Air pollution from international shipping accounts for around  per year in Europe alone, at an annual cost to society of more than 58bn [ $65bn],§ says the group on its website.Daniel Rieger, a transport officer at German environment group Nabu, said: ※Cruise companies create a picture of being a bright, clean and environmentally friendly tourism sector. But the opposite is true. One cruise ship emits as many air pollutants as five million cars going the same distance because these ships use heavy fuel that on land would have to be disposed of as hazardous waste.§Nabu has measured pollution in large German ports and found high concentrations of pollutants. ※Heavy fuel oil can contain  than diesel that is used for land traffic vehicles. Ships do not have exhaust abatement technologies like particulate filters that are standard on passenger cars and lorries,§ says Rieger.Southampton, which has Britain＊s second largest container port and is Europe＊s busiest cruise terminal, is one of nine UK cities  as breaching air quality guidelines even though it has little manufacturing.※Up to five large liners a day can be berthed in the docks at the same time, all running engines 24/7, said Chris Hinds, vice chair of the Southampton docks watchdog group WDCF. ※Pollution from the port is leading to asthma and chest diseases. We are now seeing more, bigger liners but also very large bulk cargo ships.§According to CLIA, the cruise ship industry is now one of the fastest growing sectors in the mass tourism market, with , compared to 15 million in 2006 and just 1.4 million in 1980.※The industry shows no signs of slowing down. It generated $119.9bn (?83bn) in total output worldwide in 2015, supporting 939,232 full-time equivalent jobs,§ said a spokesman. ※The luxury sector is seeing the most amazing growth that it has ever seen in its history,§ said Larry Pimentel, president of Azamara club cruises.  This article was amended on 23 May 2016. An earlier version said the Harmony of the Seas had three 16-cylinder engines which, if running at full power, would burn 96,000 US gallons of fuel a day. It has two such engines which together would burn about 66,000 US gallons of fuel a day if running at full power, and is understood to have four 12 cylinder engines. The article also said the ship must burn low-sulphur fuel in port and close to some coasts; it can also use abatement technologies to meet emissions guidelines."																																																			
"Conservative groups with close links to the  have sought to ridicule the link between climate change and events such as tropical storm Harvey, amid warnings from scientists that storms are being exacerbated by warming temperatures.Harvey, which smashed into the Texas coast on Friday, rapidly developed into a Category 4 hurricane and has drenched parts of Houston with around 50in of rain in less than a week, more than the city typically receives in a year. So much rain fell that the National Weather Service .The flooding has resulted in at least 15 deaths, with more than 30,000 people forced from their homes. Fema has warned that hundreds of thousands of people will require federal help for several years, with Greg Abbott, governor of , calling Harvey ※one of the largest disasters America has ever faced§. Insurers have warned the cost of the damage could amount to $100bn.Some scientists have pointed to the tropical storm as further evidence of the dangers of climate change, with Penn State University professor of meteorology Michael Mann stating that warming temperatures ※worsened the impact§ of the storm, heightening the risk to life and property.Conservative groups, however, have mobilized to downplay or mock any association between the storm and climate change. Myron Ebell, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency＊s transition team when Donald Trump became president, said the last decade has been a ※period of low hurricane activity§ and pointed out that previous hurricanes occurred when emissions were lower.※Instead of wasting colossal sums of money on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, much smaller amounts should be spent on improving the infrastructure that protects the Gulf and Atlantic costs,§ said Ebell, who is director of environmental policy at the , a libertarian thinktank that has received donations from fossil fuel companies such as Exxon Mobil. Thomas Pyle, who led Trump＊s transition team for the department of energy, said: ※It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that the left is exploiting  to try and advance their political agenda, but it won＊t work.※When everything is a problem related to climate change, the solutions no longer become attainable. That is their fundamental problem.§Pyle is president of the , which was founded in Houston but is now based in Washington DC. The nonprofit organization has consistently questioned the science of climate change and has close ties to the Koch family.The Heartland Institute, a prominent conservative group that produced a blueprint of cuts to the EPA that has been mirrored by the Trump administration＊s budget,  from the worlds of economics, mathematics and engineering to ridicule the climate change dimension of Harvey.※In the bizarro world of the climate change cultists ... Harvey will be creatively spun to ＆prove＊ there are dire effects linked to man-created climate change, a theory that is not proven by the available science,§ said Bette Grande, a Heartland research fellow and a Republican who served in the North Dakota state legislature until 2014.※Facts do not get in the way of climate change alarmism, and we will continue to fight for the truth in the months and years to come.§Harvey was the most powerful storm to hit Texas in 50 years, but  to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it is ※premature§ to conclude that there has already been an increase in Atlantic-born hurricanes due to temperatures that have risen globally, on average, by around 1C since the industrial revolution.Scientists have also been reluctant to assign individual storms to climate change but  has sought to isolate global changes from natural variability in disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. However, researchers are also increasingly certain that the warming of the atmosphere and oceans is likely to fuel longer or more destructive hurricanes. A  of the upcoming national climate assessment states there is ※high confidence§ that there will be an increase in the intensity and precipitation rates of hurricanes and typhoons in the Atlantic and Pacific as temperatures rise further.Harvey may well fit that theory, according to climate scientist Kevin Trenberth, as the hurricane managed to turn from a tropical depression to a category four event in little more than two days, fed by a patch of the Gulf of Mexico  than the long term average.※When storms start to get going, they churn up water from deeper in the ocean and this colder water can slow them down,§ said Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ※But if the upwelling water is warmer, it gives them a longer lifetime and larger intensity. There is now more ocean heat deep below the surface. The Atlantic was primed for an event like this.§While the number of hurricanes may actually fall, scientists warn the remaining events will likely be stronger. A warmer atmosphere holds more evaporated water, which can fuel precipitation 每 Trenberth said as much as 30% of Harvey＊s rainfall could be attributed to global warming. For lower-lying areas, the storm surge created by hurricanes is worsened by a sea level that is rising, on average, by around 3.5mm a year across the globe.The oil and gas industry has sought to see off the threat in the Gulf of Mexico with taller platforms 每 post-Katrina, offshore rigs  compared to 70ft in the 1990s 每 but the Houston, the epicenter of the industry, is considered vulnerable due to its relaxed approach to planning that has seen housing built in flood-prone areas.Barack Obama＊s administration established a rule that sought to flood-proof new federal infrastructure projects by demanding they incorporate the latest climate change science. Last week, Trump announced he would scrap the rule, provoking a rebuke from Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican congressman who called the move ※irresponsible§.Curbelo, who has attempted to rally Republicans to address climate change, wouldn＊t comment on the climate change link to Harvey. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, Texas＊s Republican senators, didn＊t respond to questions on the climate link, nor did Abbott, the state＊s governor, or Dan Patrick, Texas＊s lieutenant governor. All four of the Texas politicians have expressed doubts over the broad scientific understanding that the world is warming and that human activity is the primary cause.※It＊s essential to talk about climate change in relation to events like Hurricane Harvey and it＊s sad a lot of reports don＊t mention it in any way,§ said Trenberth. ※You don＊t want to overstate it but climate change is a contributor and is making storms more intense. A relatively small increase in intensity can do a tremendous amount of damage. It＊s enough for thresholds to be crossed and for things to start breaking.§"																																																			
"or years Chinese government officials were followed around the world, at every meeting, by a single issue: the scores of dead elephants across Africa, and the international community that blamed China for this . Even the Chinese premier, , could not escape lectures on poached elephants and the evils of China＊s legal domestic ivory trade from foreign leaders. For years, China deflected the criticism with claims of a long cultural heritage and incremental policies, such as a  two years ago. And then in June 2016, then president Barack Obama fulfilled a promise made during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, and imposed a near total ban on domestic ivory sales. China followed suit, and officials  in March 2017, with another 105 set to close by the end of the year. It was an astonishing U-turn 每 a far bigger step than campaigners had dared to hope for.So how did this come about? In many ways, the country＊s swiftly implemented ivory ban is a textbook case of international pressure effectively extractingconcessionsfor a country that often bucks global norms. The ban even met opposition within the government, with the State Forestry Administration arguing that complete prohibition was unnecessary. ※[It] argued that from a business standpoint, wild animals are the same as natural resources and they can be used sustainably,§ says Zhang Li, an elephant protection expert at Beijing Normal University, who consulted the government on the ban. The idea was that ※foreign animals don＊t matter§, Zhang says.This view was eventually overruled by the cabinet, and the State Forestry Administration has now been tasked with implementing the policy. Despite the administration＊s initial resistance, experts said enforcement is a priority at the very top of the government and lower-level agencies will be compelled to act. It is perhaps even more significant considering  has long claimed that ivory carving is an integral part of its cultural history, stretching back over 3,000 years.China actually used to have its own species of elephant, but 每 ironically enough 每 it has been extinct for more than two millennia. Ivory was used to carve statues of deities and medallions with garden scenes, which were coveted by court officials during the imperial era. Such was ivory＊s apparent prestige, that in 1974, China gave the UN a 1.5-metre long propaganda  etched into eight elephant tusks. As recently as 2007,  as a ※national intangible cultural heritage§.Chinese are fiercely proud of their cultural history 每 conversations can often turn into a lecture on why the country＊s cuisine or art is superior to western counterparts 每 yet they could not get away from the fact that the demand for ivory across Asia was fuelling the destruction of hundreds of thousands of elephants at the hands of poachers. ( savanna elephants were killed between 2007-14, according to one census.)So as China came to be seen as the main culprit for elephant poaching, attitudes within the country began to shift. Surveys in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou 每 the country＊s biggest cities 每 found that  wanted the government to ban the ivory trade to protect African elephants.The change in attitudes came more from influential voices both within and outside the nation, while most NGOs and activists were forced to adopt a softer tone on the matter, constrained by  for civil society.※There＊s a lot of groups talking about ivory, but no one would come out and say: ＆China needs to ban ivory,＊§ says Steve Blake, a campaigner at WildAid in Beijing. ※It＊s not civil societies style in China to influence policy directly, it＊s much more valuable to build public awareness.§※It＊s a combination of domestic buzz and more direct international pressure that eventually led to the outcome,§ he adds.A major player in the ban was sportsman , who has worked tirelessly to encourage his fellow countrymen to shun ivory. In 2012 he travelled to Kenya and South Africa to film a documentary where he encountered the bodies of five poached elephants. A year later he  alongside international NGOs WildAid and Save the Elephants, addressing the Chinese overconsumption of ivory and the destruction of elephant populations. In 2014, he  to parliament calling for a ban on ivory sales, shining a spotlight on the issue at the year＊s most high-profile political meeting, the Chinese People＊s Political Consultative Conference. He is also  to the country＊s parliament, and repeatedly raised the issue in multiple closed-door sessions.With Yao Ming and representatives from foreign countries shining the light on China＊s complicity in the reduction in elephant numbers, the pressure kept building. ※The premier had meetings with many foreign leaders, and every time they would bring up this issue [of ivory], so the severity of the situation was understood at the highest level in China,§ says Zhang. Amid multiple  and campaigners, even  president Xi Jinping to end the ivory trade during a state visit in 2015. Prior to his visit he made a speech explicitly urging Chinese to stop buying ivory, which was shown to millions on national television station .※International pressure from African countries, from European countries and ultimately from the US was intense and directly led to China adopting a total ban,§ says Ji Wei, an independent wildlife researcher who worked with the government on the ivory ban.China＊s relationship with Africa also played a huge role. It has increasingly spread its influence and invested heavily across the continent 每 in 2014 alone, China signed more than  there. So the fallout of the ivory trade became closer to home.※In recent years, as China has become more involved in African affairs, the protection of endangered species like elephants and rhinoceros has increasingly attracted the attention of the Chinese government,§ Zhang adds. A barrage of press reports consistently named Chinese nationals as responsible for illegal ivory smuggling, and rumours swirled that Chinese diplomats were complicit. Indeed, in June,  of smuggling ivory, before quickly apologising as relations with China quickly soured.So in the wake of then US president Barack Obama＊s , which included a ban on ivory sales, China felt compelled to act 每 the US and China are the two largest markets, and with a US ban in place Chinese officials struggled to justify a lack of action.A year later, when President Xi Jinping travelled to the US, the two countries announced a near total ban on  and plans to curb domestic sales. ※The way China was a few years ago it was a gaping wound, and that wound is now being healed,§ says Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of NGO Save the Elephants. ※Whether it＊s climate change or endangered species, China is vital and has the potential to do great work or do great harm.§Since  its ban, prices across , especially as retailers work to offload stocks they have sat on for years.※Even with the price coming down, there＊s still a heck of a lot of poaching going on,§ Douglas-Hamilton said. ※It＊s important prices have come down but it hasn＊t killed the trade, we＊re not out of the woods yet.§"																																																			
"Marks & Spencer has  more than 140 best-selling products to cut plastic use, saving 75 tonnes of packaging a year in the process.But are retailers and manufacturers doing enough? What more could and should they be doing? We asked a range of packaging experts and campaigners. Here＊s what they said.Companies should be proactively designing solutions to reduce plastic waste. Single-use plastic water bottles are perhaps the most damning culprit when there are so many alternatives readily available. I recently supported Brita＊s  campaign, committing to avoiding single-use plastic water bottles and carrying around a reusable bottle instead.In researching the SwapForGood campaign, Brita found that  of people in the UK felt embarrassed asking for tap water when not buying something else. In order for us to create a real cultural shift, we need to lose the stigma around asking for tap water, and we need companies (cafes, restaurants and even shops) to proactively welcome people to use their tap water sources for free, just as we might use their toilets. Demand for plastics is  in the next 20 years, yet our plastics system is not fit for purpose. Most plastic packaging items are used only once before being discarded, and globally  of plastic packaging is collected for recycling. The remainder gets incinerated, landfilled or worse, with more than 30% leaking out into the environment. If nothing changes, there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. This problem cannot be fixed in isolation. It is only through systemic change 每 bringing together the entire industry to fundamentally rethink the way we make and use plastics 每 that we can prevent plastic from becoming waste in the first place.The $2m  aims to accelerate innovations that keep plastics in the economy but out of the ocean. The prize is made up of two challenges: the Circular Design Challenge looks at how to get products to people without generating plastic waste 每 tackling small items such as shampoo sachets, straws or coffee cup lids 每 while the Circular Materials Challenge addresses how to make all plastic packaging material recyclable. When did plastic straws become ubiquitous? Far too often, before you＊ve said: ※No straw please§, there it is, already on its way to becoming waste 每 usually completely unnecessarily.It＊s estimated Americans alone use  every day. Used for a few minutes then discarded, once in the environment plastic never degrades but breaks into ever smaller pieces. Straws are a particular hazard. Small and light, they can end up  and .Simply telling consumers to carry reusable straws around is not the answer. It＊s up to corporations to take responsibility and reduce the plastic waste they create. They have a variety of options at their disposal, including only handing out straws on request, moving to drink-through lids, or using a sustainable, recyclable alternative.That＊s why we＊re asking McDonald＊s, which hands out free plastic straws to many of the 3.5 million people who visit its UK restaurants each day, to . A giant like McDonald＊s has the resources to create a shift in the fast food industry＊s obsession with plastic straws, .One pence. That＊s the difference in pricing between a traditional plastic bag and a genuinely compostable one. Do we really care so little about our planet that we＊re not willing to encourage our manufacturers to pay an extra ?0.01, or pass on the cost to us?We＊re starting to see alternatives, like the  we use to pack our snacks, but few companies are willing to take on the risk of trying a new material and the associated cost, even if the difference is miniscule.Packaging manufacturers are slow to develop alternative materials that can genuinely compete with traditional plastics because there＊s no real market for it. And there＊s no market for it because there is not enough demand from consumers. It＊s mind-blowing that as a society involving people, government and businesses we＊re not able to solve a problem that involves an additional few pence.It＊s vital that manufacturers support much more effective recycling solutions for the packaging they produce. We use a staggering  in the UK every day and only manage to recycle just over half of these.A nationwide deposit return system would be a brilliant next step in stopping plastic bottle pollution on our beaches and help manufacturers get much higher quality recyclate to enable the production of new bottles, creating a more circular economy. Just as we＊ve seen the small charge on plastic bags have a , with billions fewer given out,  shows a deposit-return scheme could dramatically reduce the number of plastic bottles littering our streets and marine environments.In 2016, cotton bud sticks were the  item of marine litter found on UK beaches. These buds are the epitome of ※single use§ 每 applied and immediately discarded. Worse still, consumers often litter unwittingly by flushing buds down the toilet, where our sewage system is unable to prevent them from ending up at sea.Retailers and manufacturers can take immediate action to reduce this source of marine litter by replacing plastic stems with fully biodegradable alternatives like rolled paper. Though they should still never be flushed, paper buds are likely to disintegrate and settle out in sewage, never reaching the sea. Last year, a number of companies including the UK＊s two largest supermarket chains, Tesco and Sainsbury＊s,  to ban the sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds by the end of 2017. In doing so, they joined front-runners such as Marks & Spencer and The Body Shop, which have been selling paper-stemmed buds for a number of years.However, we are yet to see an industry-wide shift. France will be  每 is this the only way to completely prevent this source of plastic pollution?.A lot of companies are doing very little to challenge the culture of throwaway single-use plastic and consumers are often left with next to no alternative than buying products wrapped unnecessarily in plastic packaging. Coca-Cola＊s recent  that all its UK bottles will be made from 50% recycled plastic by 2020 is a positive step and my hope is other big players will follow suit, but there＊s a long way to go. Most manufacturers are still largely irresponsible, both in terms of volume of plastic placed in products and the recycling process.As consumers we have power to drive meaningful change. Phasing out single-use plastics 每 where possible 每 in our day-to-day lives by taking a zero-tolerance approach to items such as plastic bottles, straws and bags is a simple first step. Every individual effort to boycott single-use plastic is a small victory but, collectively, we have an opportunity to create friction that will ultimately force companies to adapt and provide more environmentally friendly alternatives."																																																			
"he Environmental Protection Agency＊s new administrator, , has called for a ※back-to-basics§ or ※originalist§ approach to the agency. It is unclear what he means, but in a 22 May memo he said he would prioritize the EPA＊s program that handles heavily contaminated waste areas, known as ※Superfund sites§. In the memo, Pruitt heralds that under his administration, ※Superfund and the EPA＊s land and water cleanup efforts will be restored to their rightful place at the center of the agency＊s core mission§.For Pruitt, the primary role of the EPA is janitorial: using taxpayer money to clean up after polluting industries. But that is neither how the EPA was originally envisaged, nor how the Superfund program was conceived. The EPA began in 1970 as an agency charged with curbing pollution. Throughout the 1970s, Congress gave the EPA power to set limits on air pollution, regulate automobile emissions, define appropriate water treatment technology, set drinking water standards and regulate pesticides. Outside of minor provisions, this legislation was about the EPA preventing pollution, not cleaning it up. In 1976, rising concern about uncontrolled dumping and burning of hazardous materials prompted passage of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which allowed the EPA to regulate hazardous waste from cradle to grave. Unfortunately, there were already thousands of hazardous waste ※graves§ in existence. For decades, companies dumped hazardous waste haphazardly. In the 1940s and early 1950s, for example, the Hooker Chemical Company filled an old canal 每 Love canal, as it was known 每 with some 21,800 tons of chemicals, some of which Hooker knew to be hazardous. In 1953, the company covered the canal with dirt and sold it to a local school board for a dollar. The city built a school and playground atop the dump, and residents built houses along its edge. As knowledge of the hazardous legacy at Love Canal and similar places emerged in the 1970s, it generated fear, outrage and grassroots, anti-toxic movements. These movements in turn bolstered support for an EPA program to address existing hazardous waste sites. In 1980 每 10 years after the birth of the EPA 每 Congress passed the Superfund Act. The law imposed strict liability for the cost of cleanup on entities responsible for hazardous waste sites. It also established a small tax on chemical and petroleum industries that were associated with hazardous waste. Money from the tax fed a large trust fund, a ※Superfund§, which the agency could draw on to clean up ※orphan§ sites, where responsibility could not be determined. In both cases, the idea was that the ※polluter pays§, either as a directly responsible party or as part of an industry generally responsible for hazardous waste.The Superfund tax survived for 15 years, building up a large trust fund used for cleanup. Two Republican presidents, Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush, signed off on reauthorizing the tax in the 1980s and 1990s. As the Superfund program developed, the EPA discovered thousands of new sites, making funding for the program all the more important.But rightwing Republicans who took control of Congress in 1994 rebuffed Bill Clinton＊s urging to renew the tax. It expired in 1995. The trust fund peaked in 1996 at about $5.5bn (in 2016 dollars). But without a source of replenishment, the well ran dry by 2003, leaving taxpayers with the bill for cleanup. Since then, Congress has trickled general revenue money into the program with smaller and smaller appropriations ever year. Without adequate funding, the EPA＊s progress on cleanup has slowed dramatically. In 2010, the EPA asked Congress to renew the tax, arguing that doing so would ※ensure that parties who benefit from the manufacture or sale of substances that commonly cause environmental problems at hazardous waste sites, and not taxpayers, help bear the cost of cleanup§. Barack Obama and legislators have also pushed to renew the tax, but without avail.It is time to bring the Superfund tax back. No doubt, the program can be made better. Superfund taxes on industry, for example, could be better calibrated with the amount and degree of hazardous waste produced. Supplements from general tax revenues are reasonable. But the bedrock idea that industries connected to pollution should fund hazardous waste cleanup should stay in place. It is a fairer, if imperfect, system than putting the burden on taxpayers. And it is the only way to assure adequate funding over time and thus to make Superfund cleanup a priority in practice.In addition, while it is justifiable to make Superfund cleanup one of the top EPA priorities, it should not supplant the core mission of the EPA: to curb pollution before it happens. That requires enforced regulation, which also must be prioritized. We need and deserve more from the EPA than a janitor sweeping up after polluters have left the scene."																																																			
"So, the government is committed to banning all diesel and petrol cars by 2040 (, 26 July). Has it considered the wider impacts?Power stations will face huge peak-time demand when drivers charge vehicles overnight. Can they cope? Will we face increased electricity charges?The rare metals in lithium batteries are?produced only in inconvenient places. More than 85% of the world＊s supply comes from . How dependent will that make us upon them?Mining these materials is far from environmentally friendly. Each tonne processed produces 2,000 tonnes of toxic waste, laced with ammonia and hydrochloric acid. Much is dumped into landfill, decimating agriculture and poisoning drinking water. The very manufacture of an electric vehicle can create a large carbon footprint, offsetting global warming benefits. Then there is the issue of safe disposal of obsolete batteries.We could create more problems than we solve. The ban on petrol and diesel vehicles will have no immediate impact. The reality is that the decarbonisation of transport will require a combination of solutions. The government should start with the roll-out of E10, a readily available greener fuel containing 10% bioethanol. This would offer an immediate solution to improving air quality, equivalent to taking 700,000 cars off the road. It requires no new infrastructure, is compatible with almost all petrol cars today and provides a practical, simple, low-cost solution to addressing worsening air quality. E10 also provides a greener option for the petrol needed for hybrid vehicles that a growing number of consumers are opting for today, as consumer confidence in pure electric vehicles remains low.Bioethanol is a non-fossil renewable fuel which, when blended with petrol, has lower NO and particulates than diesel, and is non-carcinogenic. Our industry has already invested over ?1bn in the UK to produce it.Yet again, we are missing a golden opportunity to take action today to deliver on our climate and air quality goals, and of course to support farming and those jobs in the UK already employed in this industry. If petrol and diesel cars are replaced by electric cars then this will reduce tailpipe emissions, but not non-tailpipe emissions, which can still contribute significantly to air pollution, particularly for particulate matter. It will also reduce noise from engines, but not from tyres. Car infrastructure (roads and parking) takes up space that can be used in much better ways that are healthier for the population, for example by making it car-free public space or green space. This will also reduce heat-island effects.Finally, many people do not get enough physical activity, partly due to the use of cars, which cause disease and premature mortality. A shift away from the car to public and active transport (walking and cycling) can facilitate an increase in physical activity and save thousands of lives. We urgently need a rethink of what we want our cities to be: detrimental to health or promoting health. A shift away from car-centric cities to more active and green cities is urgently needed to achieve the latter, and a ban on diesel and patrol cars is only a small step. The traffic jam on the M25 shown in  (, 27 July) would still be undesirable even if they were all non-polluting vehicles. Commuting on today＊s scale is largely unproductive, whatever the transport mode, in both economic and personal terms. The first postwar new towns, such as Harlow, were designed to be ※self-contained and balanced communities for living and working§. For the first few years that was largely achieved, until it was destroyed by globalisation. Today thousands commute out and a similar number commute in. In planning the new developments needed to solve the housing crisis, a return to that principle as far as possible would be highly desirable. City councils are rightly concerned that ministers＊ pollution plans don＊t stack up (, 27 July). The government＊s own evidence shows that charging for urban driving is the quickest way to meet legally binding pollution thresholds. Yet?ministers would rather councils removed speed humps instead. Far from cutting the 40,000 deaths annually due to pollution, this would merely increase the numbers killed by speeding.Meanwhile the vast sums being spent on England＊s motorways and trunk roads mean yet more traffic on our city streets. And now councils are being deprived of the means either to restrain urban traffic or to invest in healthy alternatives such as cycling and walking.If funded adequately, the government＊s cycling and walking investment strategy could be a fantastic way to reduce not only pollution but also congestion, road danger and ill-health due to physical inactivity. These four urban transport problems impose similar annual costs on society: about ?10bn each, according to government estimates. Electric cars can address only the first of them, whereas cycling and walking could tackle all four.Will it take another court case before Mr Gove heeds the evidence? The latest clean air plan looks likely to put Sheffield back in the fog again. Not only are we choked by ※Chelsea tractors§ doing the school run and idling queues of traffic, but the decision  means that diesel locomotives will continue to add to our respiratory misery. The business secretary, Greg Clark, says that the decision by BMW to assemble an electric version of the Mini at Cowley is a vote of confidence in the UK industrial strategy to be the ※go to§ place for next-generation vehicles (, 26 July). The facts suggest otherwise. The key component for the electric version (the electric drivetrain) will come ready-made from Germany to be integrated into a variant of a car already in production at Cowley.The only ※go to§ aspect of the arrangement seems to be that the key technology element will be made in Germany and ※go to§ Cowley. Good for jobs at Cowley maybe, but rather lame as an industrial strategy. Other countries, including Germany, Japan, China, France and the US, are investing significantly in technology for electric vehicles. If we really expect to be a major player in this new area we will have to invest on a similar scale, and there is little sign of that."																																																			
" Scotland has a new species of butterfly: the elusive and endangered  has been discovered in a field in Berwickshire, 100 metres from the English border.It is the first time since 1884 that the butterfly has been sighted in , raising hopes that climate change has helped it become the 34th butterfly species to live and breed in the country.※Climate change is a double-edged sword but it＊s an exciting time to be in the Scottish borders,§ said Paul Kirkland of Butterfly  Scotland. ※It＊s not just butterflies but moths and dragonflies are moving north quite quickly.§More than a quarter of Britain＊s 59 butterfly species are spreading north, with insects such as the comma moving about six miles each year. In recent years, butterflies that were once only found in southern Britain have crossed the border in Scotland, including the comma and the . Within Scotland, species such as the ringlet,  and peacock have moved rapidly north and into the Highlands.The white-letter hairstreak normally lives out of sight at the tops of elm trees but was earlier this month spotted in field near Paxton, Berwickshire, by butterfly recorder Iain Cowe. While it was seen only just across the border, the nearest known colony of this small butterfly is 25 miles south in Northumberland.※It is not every day that something as special as this is found when out and about on a regular butterfly foray,§ said Cowe. ※It was a very ragged and worn individual found feeding on ragwort in the grassy edge of an arable field.§The white-letter hairstreak suffered its worst year on record in 2016, according to , and although widespread across England and Wales, has suffered a 72% decline over the last decade. Its numbers are .The butterfly＊s caterpillars feed on elm and the white-letter hairstreak declined dramatically in the 1970s as a result of Dutch Elm disease. But it has been slowly spreading north and experts believe Scotland could support a good population.Kirkland added: ※The white-letter hairstreak has been moving northwards on the east and west coasts through Northumberland and Cumbria. People have been monitoring its spread but it＊s not moving as quickly as the comma. That＊s due to the lack of elms but there＊s a fair amount of wych elm in Scotland so it could do reasonably well once it＊s up here.§It＊s the second new species for Scotland to be announced this week after. The Shetland monkeyflower was discovered by chance during fieldwork south of Lerwick."																																																			
"Nearly two years ago, she was spotted perched on an apple tree in Ontario 每 thousands of miles from her natural habitat 每 capturing the attention of birdwatchers across .Now a Bullock＊s oriole who ended up in the Ottawa area is set to finally fly home to western North America 每 in the passenger cabin of an Air Canada flight.The small orange-plumed female was first spotted near the country＊s capital in late 2015, prompting speculation that she had been blown off her migration route. ※It＊s absolutely fantastic. It＊s been mind-boggling,§ Ray Holland, who first noticed the oriole, , as hundreds of birdwatchers travelled to the area to catch a glimpse.Weeks later Holland found the bird lying in the snow, seemingly weakened by a bout of freezing temperatures. The bird was brought to the Ottawa Valley Wild Bird Care Centre, where vets found the female had lost a toenail to frostbite and was battling dehydration and hypothermia. As the bird recuperated, the centre began looking into how best to return her to her habitat. Transporting the bird to the US 每 its main range 每 seemed incredibly difficult, given federal laws and the export and import permits required.The decision was made to send her to British Columbia, the northernmost point of the Bullock＊s oriole＊s habitat. Doing so would still require special import permits allowing the migratory bird to cross provincial borders, leaving the bird＊s return mired in a process that could take up to six weeks.※These laws are there to protect our birds, so people aren＊t collecting them or keeping them,§ the centre＊s Patty McLaughlin ※It takes a lot of coordination from a lot of different people to move a bird like this across the country.§After nearly two years away from home, the bird has been booked on to an Air Canada flight leaving Ottawa airport on Wednesday morning,  She＊ll be accompanied by an employee of the airline, which arranged for a federal transport exemption to allow the bird to make the 2,700-mile journey.Upon arrival, the bird will be taken to the  Rescue Association of British Columbia, who plans to place her in an outdoor cage that will allow the bird to acclimatise to the outdoors.It＊s hoped that the bird can be released in a week or so and that she＊ll eventually undertake the journey that was impeded by red tape at the ground level 每 flying herself to the bird＊s native wintering grounds in the southern US or northern Mexico."																																																			
"oday sees the launch of the ※§. All over the country, thousands of people are going to the trouble and expense of building or buying hedgehog homes. We want to know how important this is to the lives of one of our most loved animals 每 and how we can improve the way we help hedgehogs in the future.For a hedgehog scientist 每 and believe me, there are such things 每 gathering the volume of information required to make this a meaningful study cannot be done alone. They would need to get into thousands of gardens, assess the structures, what they are made of, where they are situated. They would also need to see what other features the garden had that might encourage hedgehogs, such as access. One of the key messages from our  campaign is the necessity to make small holes, around the size of a CD case, at the bottom of fences and walls to allow the animals to roam. So how do we get the information? How do we find out what style of house works best? Well, we do that by recognising the real capacity members of the public have to provide valuable data. Science is seen by many as something that only specialists can do, but this idea is being challenged with many ※citizen science§ projects. This housing census is not the first.Hedgehog research lends itself very well to citizen science. The animal is impossible to confuse with any other species, people love them, and they share our gardens. Add to this the very real problem of dramatic population decline 每 down by about a third in urban areas and more than half in rural areas since the turn of the century 每 and we have motivation to act.We started using citizen scientists for hedgehogs over 10 years ago, when the  joined forces with the  (PTES) and recruited more than 20,000 people to take part in our ※hogwatch§ survey. PTES runs Living with Mammals 每 a survey of urban wildlife that provides clear evidence of hedgehog population decline. They also run Mammals on Roads 每 surveying rural areas through the rather gruesome count of road casualties. Again, this shows that hedgehogs are being squashed less frequently, not because they are getting faster or more clever, but because there are less of them.The contributions of thousands of people are vital to increasing our understanding of what is happening. And it is not just hedgehogs that benefit from members of the public becoming engaged in research; ornithologists got there long before us. Our understanding of the lives of birds has been transformed by the small unique rings applied to the legs of individuals through the work coordinated by the . Most of the people trained to do this are not ※scientists§ 每 but are part of the largest research department we have in the University of Life.The empowerment that comes with being involved in these research projects is tangible. The first step might be small, such as marking a sighting on the , but it is a gateway to a deeper connection with our wider environment.This step is also a way into the virtuous circle that citizen science creates. Engagement with research generates data that improves our ability to guide people into taking action to help hedgehogs. Seeing the return of hedgehogs to a garden is such a thrill, and will encourage more attention to be paid to the research, generating more data and refining our advice.Once you have seen how important your contribution can be to hedgehogs, you should have the confidence to look wider. We can all make a difference if we get engaged. So start now. Join the hedgehog housing census, help hedgehogs and maybe surprise yourself with where the journey takes you.

"lap, flap, flap, flap 每 glide. There＊s a moment reading Bowland Beth when suddenly you＊re airborne, flying above dark moorland, fixing a bird＊s eye on the human-dominated world below. That＊s exactly ＊s intention 每 because his new book goes inside the mind of one hen harrier, the much-persecuted bird of prey teetering on the brink of extinction in England.Thanks to nest cameras, a satellite tag and eyewitness accounts from birdwatchers and scientists who monitored an individual bird called Bowland Beth, Cobham has created an unusually sharp dramatisation of her life 每 and her death in 2012, after being shot. While there＊s plenty of gripping incident, Cobham has rooted it all in fact, checking with zoologists if birds grieve (yes, some do) and avoiding anthropomorphic flights of fancy. ※I＊ve kept my feet on the ground,§ he says with a smile.Cobham has form when it comes to seeing the world through the eyes of another species. He directed , the classic film based on Henry Williamson＊s book. Released in 1979, this tale of Tarka being chased to his death by otterhounds raised popular awareness about the plight of the creature, which had been all but exterminated from southern Britain. Otter-hunting was outlawed just as the film was finished and numbers have now bounced back.Cobham hopes his new book will have a similar impact. ※I wanted to dramatise Bowland Beth＊s life to get at a different audience: not the pure birder but someone who had not thought of hen harriers before 每 or the pain a hen harrier must go through when it is shot but not killed cleanly.§Stephen Murphy, a scientist with the government＊s conservation watchdog , inspired Cobham to write the book. Murphy has studied hen harriers for years and acutely understands  that preys on grouse chicks. Because grouse-shooting is big business 每 people pay up to ?4,000 a day to shoot large numbers 每 gamekeepers are under huge pressure to control predators, illegally if necessary.With a nod to Coronation Street＊s , schoolchildren in the Forest of Bowland named her Bowland Betty, but Murphy and Cobham always called her Beth. In 2012, Cobham just missed seeing her there in Lancashire 每 she sped away 30 minutes before he arrived 每 but he was able to follow her progress via Murphy＊s satellite data. ※She was Super Hen Harrier. Even when Steve was putting the tag on her as a juvenile bird, he could tell she was brighter eyed, with bigger talons and shinier plumage.§ She became known for her remarkable trips 每 dashing from Lancashire to the Scottish Borders, then on to Inverness and back again in the space of a few days. Beth also 每 fatally 每 frequented an area of North Yorkshire that Cobham calls ※bandit country§ because of its suspicious paucity of raptors.While English grouse moor owners deny they are the cause of the hen harrier＊s struggles, ecologists calculate that the country＊s uplands should support more than 300 pairs. . As a film-maker and naturalist, Cobham has had a full and fascinating career. He was born into birds:  and his great-great-great-grandfather was one of the last people to shoot a great bustard. (※Not something I＊m very proud of.§) When Cobham went to Stowe school in Buckinghamshire, he kept a tawny owl and peregrine falcon in his room. He was also allowed to own a gun and shoot rabbits. ※If you didn＊t want to do the junior corps thing, playing soldiers, you could go and fly a goshawk. It did me a lot of good.§Cobham made what he believes to be the BBC＊s first conservation film, , about the destructive farming of the 1960s and 70s. Henry Williamson, the author of Tarka the Otter, was its presenter. He told Cobham he had been offered, and had turned down, a derisory ?300 from Walt Disney for the Tarka film rights. Williamson asked Cobham if he would adapt the book instead. ※Henry said, ＆You＊ve got to do it as the sun sees things 每 without shadows.＊§ Cobham followed his instructions, devoting 18 months to a beautiful, yet brutally realistic, film.The key was his leading man: Tarka. A baby otter called Spade was procured from the Otter Trust. They could film for only two hours at a stretch before Spade would curl up asleep in someone＊s lap, but the creature was a biddable star. ※It was amazing what it would do,§ remembers Cobham. He had allowed two days to film a sequence in which Tarka hides from the hounds in a waterwheel 每 but Spade nailed it in two hours.After the success of Tarka, Cobham was contacted by a teacher who＊d heard the film-maker had some baby barn owls left over after filming. He requested a couple for a bird-obsessed pupil. Cobham duly obliged and the teenager, one , was delighted. Cobham still knows Packham, who would go on to present Springwatch on the BBC.Cobham, who was born in Yorkshire in 1930, has worked with everyone from Orson Welles to Peter Ustinov (※He wasn＊t very pleasant,§ says Cobham, who is generally gentlemanly to a fault about even his harshest critics). He met his wife, , when she played a journalist in his adaptation of , a rollicking tale of runaway kids turning feral.The never-work-with-children-or-animals adage certainly applied to Brendon Chase. One child had his appendix out a week before filming and couldn＊t run. Cobham was more confident about casting a bear after travelling to Coventry zoo to meet one. ※The door opened and this bear walked in and sat down on the chair opposite me. When its keeper came in, he lined a pipe with tobacco and the bear sat there smoking it. I knew the bear was going to be OK.§ On the final day of filming, however, the bear escaped into the New Forest. Minutes later, Cobham was approached by two children from an orienteering group. Panic-stricken, he drove about in a minibus rounding up the young orienteers. Some time later, the bear was found 每 asleep in a dried-up stream.Cobham has now retired from film-making, lives in Norfolk, and concentrates on writing. His next book will be a history of falconry, interspersed with his own memories of training a goshawk just after he had graduated. We live in a golden age of natural history documentaries, but no one makes natural history dramas like Cobham did. Why? ※Because it＊s jolly hard work,§ he laughs. ※And perhaps people don＊t like live animals being used in films.§ What about a film version of Bowland Beth? ※I wouldn＊t do it,§ smiles Cobham, ※but somebody could have a go.§ Bowland Beth by David Cobham is published by William Collins, priced ?16.99. It is available from  for ?14.44."																																																			
"nly a few years ago, they used to stage whimbrel walks at . In late summer, these birds, which look like , would stream from estuary to estuary in their thousands, on their way from breeding grounds on Orkney and Shetland to winter on the west African coast.Now, you＊re lucky to see a single one out on the salt marshes amid the wheeling terns and plover, and Rye Harbour has re-branded its walks. In folklore, this is a bird of bad omen; if you hear seven of them (the Seven Whistlers) pass over at night, death won＊t be far behind, but like the curlew,  () are dying out in Britain, and were put on the  in 2009, habitat loss being the primary cause.It＊s early evening, late July, and I＊m with Barry Yates, the reserve＊s manager, on the path that stretches along its southern edge. In winter, lorries rumble up and down here, ferrying shingle westwards in an attempt to stop the drift of stones closing over the mouth of the river Rother. Now, though, all is silent, just the wind passing through the glorious profusion of wildflowers that surround us: viper＊s bugloss, yellow horned poppies and the rare stinking hawksbeard. The sun begins to move down over the Fairlight cliffs and everything is dyed golden.Then we see them, arrowing in from the east. Six, then a dozen, curlews pass over, letting out what Ted Hughes called their ※wobbling water call§. Perhaps 20 of them settle down to roost amid the tussocky grass 每 and that＊s when I catch sight of it, off to one side, duskier and smaller than its curlew cousins. A single whimbrel with its melancholy down-curved bill, striking brown crown-stripes, standing apart as if there were something meaningful in its solitude. We wait to see if more birds land, but the light is fading, night winds whipping along the exposed lip of shore. I leave the whimbrel there, alone, imagining the island heathlands it has left behind, the Mauritanian ship-graveyards and mangrove-filled estuaries that are its destination. There is quite rightly a campaign to save our endangered curlews, but spare a thought also for the whimbrel 每 so similar, so sinister, so self-effacing it might disappear from our shores without anyone noticing at all."																																																			
																																																			
"This is an unabashed endorsement of an important group. I have no affiliation with them or conflict of interest. They are great, period.The ability to convey complex climate science to a wide-ranging audience is a golden attribute, something very few can achieve. This characteristic makes the  group unique.The Yale Climate Connections effort comprises several interrelated efforts whose end result is captivating science education for the rest of us.What is most exciting to me are their daily radio spots that focus on a current issue of climate change. The Yale group includes a team of editors, radio producers, and freelance reporters nationwide to record and post short (90-second) spots that are both interesting and informative. From someone who works in climate communication, I am surprised that a group can have this high of a throughput. It means your reporters have to be identifying relevant topics, finding experts to interview, learning enough to ask informed questions, and then perform audio edits. And this happens five days a week. The breadth and width of the topics can be seen at the group＊s . The radio spots are currently carried on almost 350 radio stations across North America and are hosted by , well known for his research on public opinions related to climate change, the ※.§In addition to the short radio segments, the group produces original feature articles and a monthly series of videos that explore topics in much more detail than the short radio spots. These longer videos are produced by award-winning videographer .In addition to its public outreach, the Yale group has worked behind the scenes to provide training workshops to help reporters, editors, and television weathercasters become more familiar with and comfortable discussing climate change with their audiences. I have worked with weathercasters quite a bit myself, and they are under a lot of pressure to provide well-watched weather forecasts and to avoid conflict that might turn off audiences. They are also confined to very short televised segments, so delving into complex climate topics is challenging. As part of this training, the Yale group and its partners involve many top scientists to update weathercasters on what is known about human influence on climate change. The experts also help the weathercasters develop stories that are true to the science but short and simple enough to be delivered within a normal broadcast. There are some other activities, but I think this summary is enough to appreciate what the Yale group is doing. With the proliferation of climate communication groups, one may wonder why the Yale team has been so successful. In my view, it is because of the quality of their team. I mentioned earlier that Dr. Leiserowitz is involved, and no one knows more about public engagement with climate change than he does.Another key player is , who began working with the Yale team in 2007. Bud has decades of editorial and writing experience on environmental and energy issues.But it isn＊t just editors and videographers that make this a winning team; it is also their scientists. For example,  is a contributor. He is well respected for his work on temperature measurements and was an author on a major studies confirming the and . He also worked for the Berkeley team which set out to test the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Nasa temperature measurements (). Karin Kirk is another regular contributor. She has an advanced degree in Earth Sciences from Montana State University and has combined her technical background with a focus on communication. There are other members of the Yale team I could mention but for brevity I will just encourage you to review their site."																																																			
"he long road from Dar es Salaam brings you through sparsely wooded hills and fields to the narrow northern neck of the Kilombero valley. There＊s a bend in the road, then the land opens out, suddenly, in front of you.Along the west side lie the steep-faced Udzungwa mountains, one of the last pristine rainforests in . The Kilombero river runs through the red soils of the valley, flooding in November or December and subsiding by June. Down the longer eastern flank rise the Mahenge mountains, and beyond them, invisible, unfurls the vast territory of the Selous game reserve, one of the largest remaining chunks of African wilderness.Ryan Shallom was 16 the first time he saw the Kilombero valley, in 1990. ※There were 600 lions in the valley back then,§ recalls Shallom, whose family were professional hunters, running trips for tourists and rich Tanzanians. The light tree cover in the valley＊s higher ground, the rivers, the abundance of food and water, meant that this was a haven not just for elephants, lions, and buffalos, but for all wildlife: a pocket Eden. ※We used to see herds of 100 elephants or more, buffalo in all directions ＃ There was the world＊s largest population of puku antelope, about 60,000. I think 75% of the world＊s population of puku were in Kilombero.§But from the mid 90s, the wildlife began to disappear. In 1998, elephant numbers in the valley were over 5,000, according to data collected by the . Now elephants are rarely seen. The lions have gone too, although there are rumours that there is one male lion left. The puku are vanishing: Shallom estimates their numbers have fallen to just over a thousand. The crocodiles, hippos, and zebra, have all more or less vanished.※We call it the ghost safari now,§ says scientist turned safari-man Roy Hinde. ※It＊s devastating.§For many years Kilombero valley defied change. Tribes such as the Pogoro, the Ndamba-Mbunga, the Hehe and the Ngindo had lived there for centuries or frequently travelled through. From 1800 onwards the Europeans 每 first Germans, then after the first world war, British 每 started to arrive, eyeing up the fertile soil and making enormous plans. But somehow their plans kept falling through. A few years after Julius Nyerere became president of an independent Tanganyika in 1961, a British survey hypothesised ※complete control of the flooding§ in the valley to ※free a vast area for irrigation§, explains Mikael Bergius, a phd student who lives in the valley. But it would never happen. Nyerere did not like western foreign investors, although help from communist China was acceptable. The majority of farmers in the valley then were small-scale tribal farmers 每 about 64,000 or thereabouts. The foreigners, meanwhile, came and went. Over and over again foreign dreams 每 a sugar plantation, a rice farm, a railway 每 withered and died in the valley.But in 1985 Nyerere stepped down. The new government set about the task of opening up to foreign investors once again. Kilombero＊s magic trick was about to come to an end.In the 90s, the decade that Shallom and Hinde both arrived in the valley for the first time, the rice plantation and the sugar plantation were already in place, but they were sluggish, half-abandoned, state-propped up enterprises. Parts of the plantations were being used by farmers from the valley, while others were being reclaimed slowly by the forest. Farmers speckled the rest of the valley but mostly it was a little oasis, far away from the 20th century.※The encroachment started in the mid 90s when the cattle started moving in,§ says Shallom. Tanzania, like other African countries, was experiencing a rapid growth in livestock 每 a profitable, moveable way to store capital at a time when demand for meat, both on the continent and in the rest of the world, was . Pastoralist tribes in Tanzania 每 particularly the Sukuma 每 began to move into the valley in ever larger numbers, bringing large herds of their distinctive long-horned cattle. A teak plantation followed, funded by  in the form of the Commonwealth Development Company (now known as CDC). Over the next few years it would take over 28,000 hectares (69,189 acres), and become the largest teak farm in Africa. In 1998, the Tanzanian government sold the sugar plantation to Illovo, Africa＊s biggest sugar company, now owned by the mega-corp Associated British Foods which continued an outgrower programme that was being tried out. There were already farmers moving into the area, but the outgrower system would turbo-charge the in-migration. The main plantation supported small-scale farmers by buying their crops at a set pre-agreed price: in some cases out-growers got training and support, and had a ready market for their crops. The model caught on fast and by 2002 there  3,300 outgrowers; by 2006 that number had swollen to nearly 6,000.Finally buyers were found for the rice plantation; another international consortium involving Agrica, another British-based company. This too began an outgrower programme which was as popular as the one up the valley. Within a few years the plantation was dealing with 480 or more outgrowers.The Tanzanian government was supportive of the growth and appeared to be supportive of the investors (although there would be clashes too). In 2009 the government announced their Kilimo Kwanza initiative 每 ※Agriculture First§ 每 which would prioritise the transformation and growth of the country＊s agricultural sector. And in 2010, the then Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete went to the World Economic Forum to , positing a new model for sustainable agricultural development based on the Kilombero outgrower model; clusters of agribusiness which incorporated small-scale farmers. Sagcot 每 the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania 每 was born and the investors loved it. USAid promised $2m on the spot. Aid money and international funds came rolling in. A bewildering network of initiatives and partnerships between business and the international sector (Feed the future, the New Alliance, the New Vision for Agriculture Initiative, the Grow Africa Partnership) was either setting up or already in place and focusing on Africa, and Tanzania and Kilombero were perfect candidates. British and   went to the rice plantation. World Bank money went to the teak plantation. USAid came in to rehabilitate roads, build bridges and generally slosh cash around. Thanks to the west, thanks to aid, it was boomtime in the valley.The population, meanwhile, grew rapidly. All you needed to do to set up a farm, after all, was to get permission from the local village and pay them a small fee, and then clear an area and get cracking. Nearby were readymade markets for your produce. The valley was beautiful, the land welcoming and fertile. It is hardly surprising that between 1964 and 2015 the valley＊s population rose from  to more than . ※We tried to get people interested,§ says Shallom. ※For years we shouted and screamed and did everything we could to get someone to pay attention. We suggested that the valley should be aggregated into the Selous reserve. We talked to the newspapers, to local government officials, to everyone we could get hold of. But no one was interested.§ The valley was being radically transformed. The miombo forest, the open plains, were disappearing as the small farms and the big farms encroached. Every day more of the valley floor was covered with miles of sugar and rice plantation, or with the monocultural teak forests.The difference is startling. Miombo forest is a mixture of high trees, evergreens, shrubs, flowers, creepers and undergrowth. You can actually hear the density of life here; the low throb of bees, a whine of other insects, the calls of the doves and the shrikes.Teak is entirely different. The trees are slender, elegant, reaching up to 150ft when mature. The leaves are huge, simple, obtuse in shape with undivided blades; they are thick and slightly sandpapery to the touch. ※When they fall on the ground,§ Hinde says, ※they kill undergrowth. You can＊t grow anything beneath teak trees.§ The empty ground beneath the trees, which grow in neat and unnerving lines, means that in this forest it is nearly silent. We spot a solitary buffalo spider, and a few butterflies.※I talked to the teak company about building wildlife corridors,§ says Hinde, who monitored the impacts for the conservation NGO . He＊d come to the valley as a young scientist, but had given up in frustration by the time he spoke to the Guardian, and started his own safari company, , hoping to instead spur action by bringing people to see the incredible wildlife. ※They did make a number of changes to make the plantations more wildlife friendly.§ Measures included setting aside large areas for conservation and breaking up the teak zones in order to help out wildlife. ※But the corridors they built were too narrow. Villagers would put pitfall traps in them and the elephants would go in feet-first and be trapped for their meat and for their ivory.§Pressure on the wildlife was also coming from the rising population. ※There has been a massive increase in smallholder farming (predominantly rice) and nomadic cattle herding,§ says KVTC head Hans Lemm. ※Pastoralists have entered the valley in significant numbers since the early 2000s.§The old tribes would eat fish, according to Father Klimakus Chahali, who grew up in the valley, and now runs the mission in the town of Itete. ※They didn＊t cut down trees.§ Rumours abounded that some of the new arrivals in the valley had a less friendly attitude to wildlife, and were killing the lions in the valley to protect their livestock. ※One year,§ says Shallom, ※I found 22 lion carcasses. They were poisoning them with pesticides.§ Bushmeat consumption and poaching rose too: ※We knew there were cartels operating in the valley but again no one wanted to know.§Other conservationists tried to sound the alarm along with Hinde and Shallom. Trevor Jones of the Southern Tanzania Elephant Program (Step) was one of the most effective; his 2007 map of the wildlife corridors in the valley along with his warnings that they would shortly be shut made it into a number of environmental assessments, including USAID＊s. ※It has been very sad to see all the overgrazing and conversion to farmland of wildlife habitat in the Kilombero valley over the last decade,§ says Jones. Anna Estes, a conservationist working in the north of the country, says: ※The main threat to elephants overall is not big agriculture, but unofficial development from subsistence farmers. 80% of farming in Tanzania is small-scale subsistence farming. Because it is unplanned, this causes a lot of damage to elephant habitat. Aside from the immediate threat from poaching, habitat loss is the number one threat to elephants these days, and human-elephant conflict is an extension of that.§ The outgrower programme 每 if inadvertently 每 magnified that effect tenfold.Today farms completely line the road that lies along the west of the valley. A brand new road is planned that will lead from Ifakara, in the centre, along down the east side beside the Selous. Everywhere you look, there are blackened stumps and cleared land, marking the new arrivals creating new farms. Forests that were here a year ago have disappeared. New farms have sprung up in their place. In a cafe in one village they tell us that most people here have arrived in the last few years; the man in charge only moved here two years ago. Has he ever seen or heard of elephants in the area? He shakes his head. No.****So how did government and aid money end up being used to help fund the destruction of a wildlife haven? ※I work more and more with the World Bank or the African Development Bank,§ says scientist Holly Dublin, ※and I see what their plans and what they are giving loans for to these governments. It is like there＊s a total disconnect. So what you are going to see is that of course, elephants come last. In fact, anything to do with wildlife comes last.§It wasn＊t that the big donors were unaware of the risks. The World Bank did  [pdf] with a specific case study on Kilombero. They highlighted the ※high risk from accelerated agribusiness investment§ noting possible ※increasing pressure on the forests and their biodiversity§. ※There was some discontent at the World Bank around the project,§ says Doug Hertzler of ActionAid, who has closely followed the impacts of the Tanzanian agricultural plans. ※For a long time the funding was held up because of the concerns.§ They hesitated and dragged their feet 每 but in the end the money went through. It was a similar story with the US aid agency, USAID, who noted in their  that ※Kilombero Valley Floodplain is of global, national, regional and local importance in terms of its ecology and biodiversity§ and added that ※the most important direct threat to biodiversity comes in the form of the conversion, loss, degradation, and fragmentation of natural ecosystems§. But they went in nonetheless, and their work can be seen all over the valley 每 including the rehabilitation of a road that runs straight through the heart of the Ruipa wildlife corridor and which will, undoubtedly bring more traffic. A USAID spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania said they were working to help Tanzania improve its environmental performance. Asked if economic development was incompatible with that, he said: ※It is a problem and we＊re very conscious of it ... When we＊re looking at doing a project we＊re looking for that balance between environmental issues and sustainable living. It＊s a juggling act and we＊re always looking for new ideas.§UK money went in too, in the form of a grant to the rice plantation and support for SAGCOT (they had also been key funders of the teak plantation). They told the Guardian: ※DFID＊s support to developing agriculture in Tanzania is vital for maintaining a stable supply of food, creating jobs and improving prosperity for hundreds of thousands of households. All our agriculture programmes are environmentally sustainable, and protect wildlife and biodiversity, while helping the poorest people lift themselves and their families out of poverty for good.§ But they also point out, very reasonably, that ※trade and job creation are the means through which developing countries will become self-sufficient, eliminate poverty and hunger, and end their dependency on aid to help Tanzania stand on its own two feet.§※I don＊t know that development banks can be blamed for not taking into account wildlife,§ says Dublin. ※They take into account the health needs, the food needs, the water needs ＃ So the fact that they have done their land use planning and the government and the guys who have responsibility for wildlife have not stepped up to the plate in that, I think you have to be careful how you tell that story. When a development agency gives a loan to expand a food project, that is what they are supposed to be doing. That is their job.§ The companies in the valley all worry about this too and have all employed their own techniques to try to stem the losses. The rice plantation has run education courses on modern agricultural techniques in order to help local people grow more rice in a smaller area; the teak plantation, in some places, has alternated teak and miombo to try to give the wildlife some space. The sugar plantation is trying to build up a forest area in one part of in the north of the valley where elephants are still sometimes seen, so that the elephants will continue to pass that way without stumbling into the plantations (a beehive fence to keep them in the forest has been strung along one point). But they agree that the problem is just getting worse. As KVTC head Lemm says: ※We have seen a significant reduction in wildlife. In particular large mammals and the various wildlife corridors that we are part of are under severe pressure.§The Tanzanian government has other priorities. Growth is, of course, prioritised over biodiversity. Julius Nyerere once said ※I personally am not very interested in animals. I do not want to spend holidays watching crocodiles. Nevertheless, I am entirely in favour of their survival.§ ※I talk to heads of state about this all the time,§ says Kaddu Sebunya, head of the African  Foundation. ※One president said to me. ＆I＊ve never had a voter ask me for more elephants or more natural parks＊. They want hospitals, education, and that＊s what keeps him awake at night.§Scientists are warning that a mass species extinction is . Agriculture  serious threats to the planet＊s biodiversity, and the demand for food and agricultural land is only going to grow. In Kilombero Valley the World Bank predicts that ※the demand for agricultural land will almost double in the coming 20 years, with a large increase for rice and maize and a smaller increase for sugarcane§. Globally, the Food and Agriculture Organisation  that an extra 1.2m hevtares of land will be needed for agriculture by 2050. ※Much of the suitable land not yet in use is concentrated in a few countries in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa,§ says the FAO report. It makes no reference to biodiversity, but does mention that ※part of the land is forested, protected or subject to expanding urban settlements.§ ※We have to be pragmatic, and agree to lose something,§ says Kaddu. The Africa Wildlife Foundation tries to explain to governments and businesses that they need an ecosystem that functions. ※If you want to continue getting water for agriculture, you need to maintain a landscape that produces rain. But the truth is that we can＊t have it all.  is going to lose wildlife. We are going to have to negotiate. We are going to have to lose a few elephants.§ Conservationists in Tanzania are working on dozens of initiatives to improve, or at least slow the decline in the biodiversity of Kilombero valley.Shallom is less sanguine. After years of battling with the state, he shut down his hunting lodge and left the valley. For a while he just gave it all up and let his business fall away; he admits that for the last few years he has struggled. Now he has two new concessions in the Selous; for the first time in the conversation his face lights up as he talks about building up the wildlife there again. But the happiness disappears when we go back to the subject of the valley. ※I＊ve seen Kilombero from its best to its worst,§ he says. ※To me it is a closed chapter, a very bitter pill I had to swallow. Kilombero is done now. It＊s over.§"																																																			
"hat equality matters in terms of health and happiness has been . But it is also better for the environment. The evidence (which is still emerging) suggests the  contribute more to climate change via pollution than their more equal counterparts.A large section of their people may suffer more, too.  predicts the United States will see its levels of economic inequality increase due to the uneven geographical effects of climate change 每 resulting in ※the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in the country＊s history§, ., Oxfam found that the greatest polluters of all were the most affluent 10% of US households: each emitted, on average, 50 tonnes of CO2 per household member per year.  were the next most polluting, followed by the British, Russian and South African elites.In more equitable affluent countries such as South Korea, Japan, France, Italy and Germany, the rich don＊t just pollute less; the average pollution is lower too, because the bottom half of these populations pollute less than the bottom half in the US, Canada or Britain, despite being better off.In short, people in more equal rich countries consume less, produce less waste and emit less carbon, on average. Indeed, almost everything associated with the environment improves when economic equality is greater. When you buy an item, you don＊t think about junking it. But you will eventually throw away almost everything you buy. Some of it you may recycle, but recycling is not only never fully efficient, it also uses a great deal of energy and hence generates pollution itself.Not buying things you don＊t need is far better, but in a world where the main function of advertising is to get you to buy things that you could live without, that is hard.In more unequal societies, there is a proliferation of products that are designed not to last, so as to allow greater profits to be made. Producing endless must-have new versions exploits the higher levels of emotional insecurity that living with great inequality generates.The success of the clothing industry is an interesting example. People buy far greater quantities of cheaper clothes and throw them away more frequently in the most economically unequal countries. of 2,000 women suggested that the majority of clothes are bought because they are seen as fashionable and are worn, on average, just seven times before they are discarded. A third of women see them as old after they have been worn three times., in which each country is sized according to its population, tracks an environmental indicator (the vertical axis) against levels of inequality (the horizontal one). Countries to the right are more unequal, while countries that are high up produce more waste. If the correlation between the two were perfect, they would all line up along a line drawn from the bottom left to the top right. Inevitably there are outliers that don＊t fit 每 in this case Denmark and Switzerland, and this could be because they do a better job of collecting data on waste than other countries.But the tendency of the more unequal countries to produce more waste is still striking overall 每 and would be even more so if the 50 US states were included separately as smaller circles. In Japan people on average buy and throw away half as much as people in the US 每 of everything!In economically unequal countries the pressure to buy items to keep up with your peers, with ※people who count§, is enormous, especially when it comes to clothes, fashion, new cars and other status symbols. We are encouraged to be aspirational, to better ourselves, not for the greater good, but for selfish reasons 每 ultimately to be able to get all that stuff. A good job is no longer one which benefits society, but one that pays you well.Eating a lot of meat is not good for you or the planet. The amount of crops that have to be grown and transported to feed the animals that we eat is far greater than the amount that would be needed if we just ate the crops themselves. So, the more meat per person that is eaten in a country, the less environmentally friendly the people of that country collectively are., most of the animal life on our planet is now intensively farmed for our own consumption. Those animals produce enormous amounts of greenhouse gases during their short lives, with cattle being the worst polluters of all. The most common bird on the planet is now the domestic chicken, reared solely because so many of us in the rich world have become so used to eating cheap meat. suggests that the more unequal countries (again sized according to population) tend to consume more meat. Again, there are a few outliers 每 notably Australia and New Zealand/Aotearoa, possibly because their cultural histories are bound up with the rearing of sheep and cattle and their high levels of meat production. But the general trend is clear.Increasing meat consumption has not made us healthier. In some countries, we are now eating so excessively that it is making many of us obese.  are much higher in affluent countries that are more economically unequal. One theory as to why is that the poor in such countries have to resort to cheap fast food, which is advertised to them aggressively and often includes lower-grade meat. Another theory is that in more equitable countries, the population tends to be better educated and so can more easily see through the folly of fast-food advertising and gluttony.What we do know is that people in more economically unequal countries in general eat more meat per person by weight. Whatever the reason, the world needs human beings to eat less meat if we are to avoid depleting our soils, increasing greenhouse gases and also reducing the biodiversity of the planet to such an extent that monocultures prevail and we lose habitats.We mainly extract water for agricultural uses, to water the crops that we then feed to the animals, but we also use water for industries that produce more stuff and more packaging for that stuff than we actually need.The final use we have for water is for ourselves, for domestic use, and here, just as with meat, we can see huge variations between countries that are otherwise similarly wealthy. And again the variations appear to be related to economic inequality.In more unequal affluent countries, people on average consume more water for personal use 每 or are far more wasteful over their use of water.  measures domestic water consumption against economic equality for the 25 most affluent countries in the world.Again, the excessive use in the US stands out: consumption per person there is about three-and-a-half times higher than in Germany. It is not as if the US has ample rainfall: you can look at the  any week of the year to see their ongoing problems.The relationship between water consumption and inequality seems clear, though there is quite a lot of variation. The UK may use a little less water than might be predicted from its levels of economic inequality, partly because the climate of the UK makes it less useful to have private outdoor swimming pools if you are rich. In contrast, more water is used per head in Australia than might be expected from its level of inequality, presumably because of its warmer climate.So why are people in Canada, Singapore and the US using so much more water for domestic purposes than those in Germany, France or Japan? Possibly there is a lot less concern about wasting water in more unequal countries. Toilet cisterns may be less ※eco-friendly§, people may worry a little less about watering the garden with a chlorinated supply designed for human consumption, not for plants.It is not that people are cleaner and wash more often in the more inequitable countries (per person, the Japanese ), and it is certainly not that they are drinking more water. What is happening is that they are wasting more, and that may be related to a more general ethos that people should be free to do as they wish and damn the consequences for others 每 an ethos that appears to be far more prevalent in more inequitable countries.The most damaging form of pollution (in terms of absolute effect) is the carbon dioxide (CO2) we are responsible for releasing into the atmosphere. Residents of the US contribute more emissions of CO2 than any other of the 25 rich countries featured. US emissions per person are almost twice those of the Japanese, and more than three times those of the French.In general, the more economically unequal a rich country is, . There are exceptions of course: the UK is a relatively low emitter because it currently has access to natural gas from the North Sea and has already mined and burned its most accessible coal; 75% of France＊s electricity production derives from nuclear power, which emits less CO2 but creates much longer-lasting radioactive waste. In contrast, Australia mines and burns a great deal more coal (and also, incidentally, mines a large amount of uranium).In 2016 Oxfam reported in detail on why emissions from some countries were so much greater than others (). Collaborating with economists including Thomas Piketty, it discovered that what drove excessive consumption in any particular affluent country was economic inequality, because the best-off in a country tend to waste more energy, heat their homes more than they need to, drive more than they need to in bigger gas-guzzling cars, take more flights and require more cement and other materials to construct their larger-than-needed buildings 每 while at the same time buying and throwing away more items.Globally, half the CO2 emissions associated with individual lifestyles are due to the actions of the richest tenth of humanity, who disproportionately live in the more unequal of the world＊s most affluent 25 countries. Our excessive use of motor vehicles contributes not only CO2 but also other damaging gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, as well as pumping particulate matter into the air we all breathe.Among the most affluent 25 countries,  as extreme in this regard: the US, Canada and Australia. These three are among the least-densely populated countries in the rich world, and driving distances between homes and workplaces are often long, but they have chosen to arrange their cities in this way. That choice was again affected by economic inequality and the beliefs associated with it: that individual aspirations should trump the collective good, and that ※the car is king§.Relatively low petrol/gasoline use in the UK, Singapore and Israel shows that very unequal countries need not necessarily use huge amounts. In these three cases, there are large dense urban areas that can only function with good public transport such as underground trains, buses and trams.But it is worth noting that no relatively equal affluent country consumes more than half as much gasoline as people in Canada and the US do each year. All of us will have to consume far less fossil fuel in the near future, and those reductions will be far more easily achieved in a country that sees the provision of efficient, low-polluting public transport as a collective good rather than a dangerous precedent.Consider the proportion of people who  in each country. This ranges from 50% (in the Netherlands) to less than 5% (in the US).Everything is connected. People are fatter in the US because they eat more food; because they sit in cars more often and for longer; because they are exposed to more advertising and eat more and buy more cars as a result; because they live in greater fear of crime and so are afraid of not driving; and because they are surrounded by other obese people and therefore don＊t feel so unusual if they are also fat.But behind all of these factors lies the basic difference in how human beings are ranked. Rank them sky high by paying them many times more than other people, and they can become so conceited that they more easily treat others who are less well-off poorly, with no respect and with little empathy. When pay differentials are less and no-one＊s income is out-of-this world, people realise they have far more in common with others. They then argue for cycle routes, pavements, good public transport, and to be able to afford to live near where they work.Even in the US, there is still much hope 每 new learning occurring and new understanding growing 每 but it is happening locally rather than nationally. , a 20mph limit was agreed in 2016 for all residential streets in the city. The downtown arterial roads in that city will now be limited to 25mph, making it far safer to cycle along those roads and to cross them as a pedestrian.Such measures, of course, also encourage people not to believe their car will get them from place to place more quickly than others can travelling by bus or, where it is available, by light rail.One way in which the residents of affluent countries can pollute less is by flying less. Many of the flights we undertake are unnecessary, but we take them because we can. Of course, most people 每 even in affluent countries 每 will not fly in any given year, while a few will fly often.Those who pollute the most (per person) are executives flown around in private jets. It is at take-off that aircraft use most fuel, so  shows the average number of airplane take-offs per person per year in each country. Again there is a relationship with inequality 每 and again, a few of the outliers can be explained by the presence of many remote settlements, or by a country being an island (in the case of New Zealand/Aotearoa).The US dominates, and if circles for all its separate states were drawn, the overall pattern would look even more obvious. It could instead have chosen to develop a series of high-speed rail lines across its land, as other affluent countries have done and as even less affluent ones such as China are now doing.The US is notable for the number of people living there that have never left their own country, so most of its air flights are internal. It is also well known for preferring free enterprise and competition to social planning. High-speed rail lines require planning and timetabling.In the majority of the 25 countries, less than one plane takes off per year for every 100 people living there. In the UK it is nearer two planes, in the US three, in Canada four and in Norway five. Norway is famously equitable, but it is also remote and has access to relatively cheap aircraft fuel from its oilfields. Being more equitable is no guarantor of better environmental behaviour, but it tends to be associated with it.In 1443, Shinto priests who lived on the edge of  in Japan began recording the day when the lake froze over in winter and when the temperature changes created a ridge of ice across the surface. They believed the ridge was formed by the feet of the gods as they walked over the lake, and so they carried on recording the day the ridge was formed each year after that, to the present day.In the first 250 years of the priests＊ recordings, the lake only failed to freeze over three times. Between 1955 and 2004, it failed to freeze over 12 times. Between 2005 and 2014, it failed to freeze over five times 每 every other year. Since 2014 it has not frozen over.There are many different records of global warming, but the Lake Suwa records are the longest and most striking.It is only since the late 1970s that the 25 rich countries focused on in this article have begun to diverge widely in their levels of economic inequality. Because they have done so, a set of natural experiments has been set up which today allows research into the effects of these differences.The preliminary conclusion, based on these natural experiments, is that the more economically equitable countries tend to perform better across a wide range of environmental measures. Once we know what the driving forces are, and become fully aware of the damage that is done by inequality in environmental as well as social terms, we will know how necessary it is to embrace change."																																																			
"Scientists have uncovered the largest volcanic region on Earth 每 two kilometres below the surface of the vast ice sheet that covers west .The project, by Edinburgh University researchers, has revealed almost 100 volcanoes 每 with the highest as tall as the Eiger, which stands at almost 4,000 metres in Switzerland.Geologists say this huge region is likely to dwarf that of east Africa＊s volcanic ridge, currently rated the densest concentration of volcanoes in the world.And the activity of this range could have worrying consequences, they have warned. ※If one of these volcanoes were to erupt it could further destabilise west Antarctica＊s ice sheets,§ said glacier expert Robert Bingham, one of the paper＊s authors. ※Anything that causes the melting of ice 每 which an eruption certainly would 每 is likely to speed up the flow of ice into the sea.※The big question is: how active are these volcanoes? That is something we need to determine as quickly as possible.§The Edinburgh volcano survey, reported in the special publications series, involved studying the underside of the west Antarctica ice sheet for hidden peaks of basalt rock similar to those produced by the region＊s other volcanoes. Their tips actually lie above the ice and have been spotted by polar explorers over the past century.But how many lie below the ice? This question was originally asked by the team＊s youngest member, Max Van Wyk de Vries, an undergraduate at the  and a self-confessed volcano fanatic. He set up the project with the help of Bingham. Their study involved analysing measurements made by previous surveys, which involved the use of ice-penetrating radar, carried either by planes or land vehicles, to survey strips of the west Antarctic ice.The results were then compared with satellite and database records and geological information from other aerial surveys. ※Essentially, we were looking for evidence of volcanic cones sticking up into the ice,§ Bingham said.After the team had collated the results, it reported a staggering 91 previously unknown volcanoes, adding to the 47 others that had been discovered over the previous century of exploring the region.These newly discovered volcanoes range in height from 100 to 3,850 metres. All are covered in ice, which sometimes lies in layers that are more than 4km thick in the region. These active peaks are concentrated in a region known as the west Antarctic rift system, which stretches 3,500km from Antarctica＊s Ross ice shelf to the Antarctic peninsula.※We were amazed,§ Bingham said. ※We had not expected to find anything like that number. We have almost trebled the number of volcanoes known to exist in west Antarctica. We also suspect there are even more on the bed of the sea that lies under the Ross ice shelf, so that I think it is very likely this region will turn out to be the densest region of volcanoes in the world, greater even than east Africa, where mounts Nyiragongo, Kilimanjaro, Longonot and all the other active volcanoes are concentrated.§The discovery is particularly important because the activity of these volcanoes could have crucial implications for the rest of the planet. If one erupts, it could further destabilise some of the region＊s . Meltwater outflows into the Antarctic ocean could trigger sea level rises. ※We just don＊t know about how active these volcanoes have been in the past,§ Bingham said.However, he pointed to one alarming trend: ※The most volcanism that is going in the world at present is in regions that have only recently lost their glacier covering 每 after the end of the last ice age. These places include Iceland and Alaska.※Theory suggests that this is occurring because, without ice sheets on top of them, there is a release of pressure on the regions＊ volcanoes and they become more active.§And this could happen in west Antarctica, where significant warming in the region caused by climate change has begun to affect its ice sheets. If they are reduced significantly, this could release pressure on the volcanoes that lie below and lead to eruptions that could further destabilise the ice sheets and enhance sea level rises that are already affecting our oceans.※It is something we will have to watch closely,§ Bingham said."

Hazelwood, in Victoria＊s Latrobe Valley, is Australia＊s dirtiest power station and one of the most polluting power stations in the world.The executive director of the Climate and  Alliance, Fiona Armstrong, said the community would reap significant health benefits from the closure.※People in the Latrobe Valley have suffered a burden of ill health from the pollution caused by the burning of coal over a long period, given it is linked to cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological diseases, as well as lung cancers,§ she said.※For children with asthma, the elderly, and people with respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, this announcement is good news.§But Gannon said that while it was accepted that brown coal is the dirtiest way to produce power, he was not convinced there were enough alternatives available to immediately replace the power generated by Hazelwood.※I＊m not convinced we have that right,§ Gannon said. ※We need a mature debate about the power supply because it powers our hospitals, our schools and other essential infrastructure.※There is also the health affects of unemployment that need to be considered. The Australian Medical Association has clear positions about the risk of providing energy supply through fossil fuels and specifically the risk of brown coal, but somewhere in this we would call for common sense.※We need stable base-load power as well, and we need grown-up conversations about gas and nuclear power while technology is developed to deliver renewable energy.§In it＊s submission to the 2013 Senate inquiry into air quality, the Australian Medical Association warned that increasing pollution from road transport and mining, combined with the growing effects of climate change, was exposing communities to an increasingly toxic mix of airborne chemicals and particles that were harming health.The submission warned that ※thousands of Australians are dying prematurely or being hospitalised for asthma attacks and heart complaints because of lax standards and enforcement that leave millions exposed to harmful levels of particulate matter, diesel fumes and other airborne pollutants§.While Gannon said there was ※no question§ brown coal was the worst way to generate power, he said the industry needed more certainty.※It＊s our industries that pay the taxes that pay for services in our society, like healthcare and hospitals,§ he said.※I don＊t have a puritanical view of renewable energy. We must have secure energy supply in our country. The desire of health groups is to see a greater proportion of power coming from renewables, but we can＊t be risking blackouts that can also effect hospitals.§Armstrong said she agreed with Gannon that energy security was a pressing issue for hospitals and other essential services. But she said climate change was causing extreme weather events such as cyclones and increased flooding which was impacting hospitals and patients. ※We＊ve seen examples where hospitals had supply interrupted from extreme weather events,§ she said. ※Brown coal fuels climate change which causes these events to occur more frequently and more severely.§According to Environment , Hazelwood uses 27bn litres of water and emits 7,800 tonnes of hydrochloric acid each year. Burning coal is responsible for approximately 95% of air pollution in the Latrobe Valley, according to the Victorian Environment Protection Authority, while the CSIRO have estimated the cost of poor indoor air quality in Australia may be as high as $12bn per year.A Melbourne emergency physician, Dr Stephen Parnis, said from a health perspective moving away from coal could only be positive. He was president of the AMA Victoria in 2014 when the devastating Morwell fires spread into the Hazelwood mine.※We are still watching closely to see if there are any long-term impacts to people＊s health from that fire,§ he said.※Exposure to inhaled pollutants is known to be a cause of chronic heart disease, and anything that improves air quality such as reducing the burning of fossil fuels can only be a good thing for the health of the population of the La Trobe Valley.§ "																																																			
"Lower, properly enforced speed limits are the key to tackling all the costs and nuisances of traffic (, 25 March). A report from the Policy Studies Institute in 1996 concluded that speed limits on main roads should be reduced, with the speed limit on motorways certainly no higher than 60mph. The immediate consequence of strict enforcement of lower limits would be reductions in road crashes and casualties, fuel consumption, CO emissions and noise. Capacity would be increased. Traffic levels would be reduced by checking and then reversing the tendency for car journeys and lorry hauls to increase in length.The default speed limit in towns should be 20mph. Combined with bus priorities, measures to make walking and cycling safer and more agreeable, and planning policies to encourage smaller, local shops and other facilities, lower speeds in towns would have a profound influence on modal choice and journey length. The best way of enforcing speed limits is by variable speed limiters on the vehicle. They can either be operated by the driver or activated externally. Both types of speed limiter have been shown to be technically feasible and inexpensive.By far the biggest obstacle to more rapid progress in tackling all the adverse impacts of road traffic is the amazing cowardice of successive governments on anything to do with speed limits and their enforcement. Instead of inconveniencing driverless cars (, 20 March) with largely one or two upscale individuals in them working while transiting in their mobile office, perhaps the flipside would be to give priority to the larger people flow made possible by pedestrians and bicycles not having to wait on idling automobiles going through their stop and go cycles. What law of nature requires that a machine-transported individual has innate priority over a pedestrian, or that the business or activity of a?pedestrian is of less value than the time of a motorist? We might well discover an economic boost if large numbers of pedestrians did not have to waste time waiting on lights at intersections. Zoe Williams gave a 9/10 rating to a diesel car (, 25 March). And she has form on this, regularly reviewing cars as eco-friendly merely because of the ludicrously inaccurate CO figures published by manufacturers. Please will a science journalist, or a journalist who cycles to work and knows how poisonous NO and PM are, explain that there is nothing ※eco§ or atmosphere-friendly about a diesel car. It is bad enough that the government refuses to ban them. But?that the Guardian regularly commends them to its readers, and carries adverts for them, adds insult to injury."																																																			
"hen Jianjun Xu woke up one morning in May 2015, the ground floor of his house in Gongcheng, Guilin, was flooded. After heavy rainstorms, the nearby Cha River swelled, sweeping away hundreds of homes. ※The water was up to my knees,§ he says. ※It smelled awful and there was garbage floating in my living room.§ Xu didn＊t understand how the floodwater had reached his street. Anti-flood barriers had been under construction since December 2012. Given the speed of Chinese infrastructure work, he thought the project had been completed. But instead of a construction site, he found a green river, its banks decorated with garbage. Meanwhile, buses choke Guilin＊s main boulevards morning and evening. Led by guides, large groups of tourists take selfies in front of local landmarks, such as the imposing Nengren Temple, and stroll the streets of Guilin＊s old town and through its spacious parks. In the evening, they gather to enjoy a daily performance of an ancient opera or join local groups of elderly residents who dance to keep fit. From a rooftop cafe, one can see the Sun and Moon towers on Fir Lake as the city sprawl continues into the distance, giving way to bright green forests and hills, the stunning landscape Guilin is famous for. Throughout the municipality, red banners emblazoned with slogans like ※an international tourism destination of peerless beauty§ hang strategically, reminding newcomers of Guilin＊s millennia-old reputation as China＊s most beautiful city. In nearby Yangshuo and Longsheng, karst peaks dominate a breathtaking landscape. The Li River carries visitors on bamboo rafts through the formations, as water bottles and plastic bits float alongside. . The local government aims to increase that to over 27% by 2020 as part of their campaign to become China＊s ecotourism destination.※As a less developed province, much of Guangxi remains a natural landscape,§ explains Cheng Zhang, South  programme director at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ※This includes a great number of protected areas, such as nature reserves, forests and wetlands, which provide essential ＆nature＊ for conducting ecotourism activities.§ Xu, though, isn＊t concerned about tourism. As of November 2016, the anti-flood barriers remain unfinished. Construction companies and locals jettison their waste in the informal dumping ground wedged between the waterway, farmland and the city. More worrisome, the Cha River remains green.  ※I have seen farmers throw dead chickens and pigs into the water, not far from where people are fishing. People drink that water,§ says Xu. The Guilin municipal government has taken efforts to improve the water quality of the Li River, one of the city＊s main attractions. , officials are relocating industries, building wastewater treatment plants and landfills, and fighting pollution. However, the issues of other rivers like the Cha have been overlooked.  ※Since leader Deng Xiaoping＊s visit in the 1970s, the Li River has been a priority for the government because of its beauty,§ says Ma Jun. ※However, other rivers in Guilin are suffering from breakneck urbanisation and are more polluted and facing challenges. They are in less developed areas with weak sewage management and infrastructure.§ Greenpeace China told the Guardian that one third of the country＊s rivers are contaminated. According to a report from the ministry of water resources in April 2016,  wells are also polluted. ※In cities, you have wastewater from sewage, shops, factories and agriculture, which add other pollutants like persistent organics and heavy metals. It＊s usually not fit for drinking or for crops,§ explains Dr Wolfgang Kinzelbach from the Institute of Environmental Engineering in Zurich, Switzerland, an expert on China＊s water management. Despite Beijing＊s increased transparency , water pollution remains a taboo in China.  have been charged with espionage for speaking out about the situation. Many Chinese scientists who have studied water pollution in Guilin refused to be interviewed. ※I＊m not that brave. I don＊t want to offend the government,§ said one. ※Mining in the mountainous area in Guangxi [Guilin＊s province] is a serious problem and it is an major reason why very clean water becomes polluted,§ says Ma. A 2016  found that the Qingshitan reservoir, an important source of Guilin＊s reservoir, was polluted, reporting above average nitrogen and organic carbon content. The report credits agricultural, industrial and domestic sources as the pollution culprits. The results revealed that the water had an intermediate level of eutrophication, an excessive richness of nutrients that causes a dense growth of algae and suffocates animals such as fish. It also turns water green.Eutrophication may lead to blooms of algae that can harm the liver and nervous system, explains Dr Urs von Gunten, an expert on China water resources from the Laboratory for  Quality and Treatment in Lausanne, Switzerland.Activists are concerned about the consequences of water pollution on the Chinese population. ※Cancer villages§ 每 small communities near polluting factories where cancer rates have soared far above the national average 每 have .  ※It takes a long time to restore river ecology when such pollution has occurred, meaning that generations could be affected by the pollution,§ says Deng Tingting, toxics campaigner for Greenpeace East Asia. In the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, where Guilin is located, a  of boarding schools found that drinking polluted water caused 80% of outbreaks of water-borne diseases. ※The range of human health impacts from water pollution extends from damage to the reproductive system, birth defects, cancer, sterility, as well as a whole host of neurological and cardiac diseases,§ says Dr Devra Davis, an epidemiologist at the Environmental Health Trust. ※China is sacrificing a generation because of this pollution issue.§ Back in Gongcheng, a farmer named Meng tends his crops on the banks of the Cha. Plastic bags and discarded household items line his property. ※I am not worried about pollution,§ he says. ※I use the river water for my vegetables and they taste fine. My customers at the market never complain.§ Xu is less at ease with the situation. ※Why is the water still green? Why is there garbage here instead of anti-flood barriers?§ he asks with a deep sigh. As part of Xi Jinping＊s , local officials have come under scrutiny from the central government. A source close to the local government says that in order to woo visiting national delegations, the municipal government organises outings to specific areas that flatter local officers, such as Hongyan and Aizhai. Before an official visit from vice premier Wang Yang in 2015, a road to Hongyan was completed. ※I find the timing suspicious,§ says Xu. ※Local governments must take greater responsibility for protecting China＊s water environment,§ says Tingting, the activist from Greenpeace. There are signs that the threat posed by water pollution is being taken seriously. Beijing launched the  in 2015, with the target that 93% of the country＊s water sources should reach national standards by 2020. Municipalities are testing different energy alternatives, such as . Citizens can also report polluted rivers to the government via the . Such efforts may be too little, too late. ※There is no solution that fits all problems,§ says Von Gunten. ※In my opinion, the protection of water resources is the most important factor.§ Others remain optimistic. ※Change is not going to happen overnight, but China has promised it will tackle pollution as resolutely as it has tackled poverty,§ says Debra Tan, who works for not-for-profit group China Water Risk. On the banks of the Cha River, Xu is concerned that water pollution will worsen before any real change happens. He seems resigned. ※In Chinese, we have a saying: ＆People can always find a way to cope with government policies,＊§ he says. ※I guess this pollution is something we are going to have to live with.§"																																																			
"Conservative politicians are trying to stop a complete EU ban on bee-harming pesticides, despite the new environment secretary ＊s statement earlier this week, in which he said ※I absolutely don＊t want to water down§ EU environmental protections.Neonicotinoids are the world＊s most widely used insecticides but have been banned on flowering crops in the EU since 2013. However, the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) found in 2016 that use of the pesticides on all crops poses a high risk to bees. As a result, the European commission has , first revealed by the Guardian in March.On Thursday, an attempt by the Conservative MEP Julie Girling to block the full ban will be voted on by the European parliament＊s environment committee. Most of the UK＊s environmental protections derive from the EU and since the Brexit result many green groups have been concerned that these could be weakened after Britain leaves the EU.Gove gave reassurances on Monday, telling : ※We need to maintain, and where possible enhance, environmental and animal welfare standards. We have a strong position and good track record in both of those areas and I do not for a moment want to see either of them diluted or eroded.§The Guardian asked the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if Gove backed Girling＊s attempt to block the pesticide ban. A spokeswoman did not answer directly but said: ※The government has fully applied restrictions on the use of neonicotinoids introduced by the EU. We make all decisions on pesticides based on the science.§Matt Shardlow, at the conservation charity Buglife, said: ※Conservative politicians have repeatedly led the charge to face down measures to restrict harmful pesticides. Buglife would like to see a clear commitment from the  that after Brexit our environment and health will be in safe hands. It is time to start listening to the people and respecting the experts.§Martin Dermine, from Pesticide Action Network , said Girling＊s arguments against the full ban were no different to those put forward by the pesticide manufacturers: ※Such a similarity between an MEP＊s work and the industry＊s arguments is shocking. Bee-killing neonicotinoids should never have been authorised and it is more than time to ban them.§Girling said there was no link between her and the pesticide industry: ※I just happen to agree with them on this issue. I believe that the sustainable use of pesticides is a vital part of providing safe and affordable food production.§ The MEP said she agreed with Gove＊s reassurances: ※His statements do not support policy which seeks to ban all pesticides indiscriminately.§Graeme Taylor, from the European Crop Protection Association, said: ※The size of the toolbox available to farmers to allow them to produce is being constantly depleted by decisions that are based on fear and misinformation rather than fact, and without consideration of the consequences for European agriculture.§In a debate in the European parliament environment committee on Wednesday, Girling was challenged by a commission official Klaus Berend. He said arguments over whether widespread harm to bees had been proven or not missed the point of the EU regulations: ※The principle of the regulation is that safe use must be demonstrated, not the other way around.§ With Efsa finding high risks to bees, Berend said: ※There is no other choice for the commission than to act.§The idea that pesticides are essential to feed a fast-growing global population was  in March, in a report by UN food and pollution experts. It severely criticised the global corporations that manufacture pesticides, accusing them of the ※systematic denial of harms§, ※aggressive, unethical marketing tactics§ and heavy lobbying of governments which has ※obstructed reforms and paralysed global pesticide restrictions§.In April, a major study found  use while still producing as much food, and that chemical treatments could be cut without affecting farm profits on more than three-quarters of farms. MEP Girling＊s attempt to block the full ban on neonicotinoids was rejected by the European Parliament＊s environment committee on Thursday. In the vote, 43 MEPs voted against Girling＊s objections, eight voted in favour and seven abstained. "																																																			
"The number of electric cars in the world accelerated past the 2m barrier last year, as prices fell and manufacturers launched new models.The number of battery-powered vehicles numbered just hundreds globally in 2005 and passed the 1m milestone in 2015, but sales jumped 60% in 2016.China, the US and Europe accounted for more than 90% of electric vehicle sales last year, with China the single biggest market, according to .In some European countries, growth has been so fast that electric cars are taking significant market share from petrol and diesel cars. Nearly a third of new cars sold in Norway are electric, the highest proportion worldwide, followed by 6.4% in the Netherlands and 3.4% in Sweden.While the UK lags behind on annual registrations,  showed that a record 4.4% of new cars sold in May were hybrid or pure electric models. More than 100,000 electric cars have been sold in the UK under a grant scheme launched in 2011.The growth globally indicated a ※rapid market evolution§ in electric cars, the IEA said, but it cautioned that they made up only 0.2% of all passenger cars. Greg Archer, clean vehicles director at the Brussels-based Transport and Environment group, said: ※The rapid rise in electric vehicle sales is a consumer-driven phenomenon rather than being down to the efforts of suppliers.§ Decreasing costs, longer battery ranges and an increasing number of charging points were driving demand, he said.Worldwide, the IEA found there were 2.3m charging points, although public ones were outnumbered more than six to one, suggesting most drivers were recharging at home.The agency estimates that there will be 140m electric cars by 2030 globally if countries meet the Paris climate deal＊s goal of avoiding dangerous temperature rises.Previous forecasts for the growth of the cleaner vehicles has been overly optimistic. Barack Obama , but the actual number was 280,000. In May, Angela Merkel admitted that .However, the IEA said government policies to tackle air pollution and global warming would buoy electric cars. The vehicles also got a boost this week from 10 countries including the UK, US, France, Germany and Japan, which  to an aspirational but non-binding target of 30% of market share for electric vehicles by 2030.Oil companies have been sceptical about the impact electric cars will have on oil demand.  that even with a hundred-fold growth in electric cars by 2035, oil demand will still be growing. However, the company＊s chief executive, Bob Dudley, said recently that in the 20 years ※obviously sales of electric vehicles will accelerate§.Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP＊s chairman, told shareholders at the group＊s AGM in May that the company would benefit from producing the gas to generate electricity for the increasing number of battery-powered cars."																																																			
"US coastal areas are set to be deluged by far more frequent and severe flooding events if greenhouse gas emissions aren＊t slashed, with rare floods becoming the norm for places such as New York City, Seattle and San Diego, new research has found.The , undertaken by researchers from Princeton and Rutgers universities, found that along all of the US coastline, the average risk of a 100-year flood will increase 40-fold by 2050.Such floods are statistically expected to occur only once every 100 years because of their severity, although this doesn＊t mean these sort of floods never happen in consecutive years. The annual chance of such a flood is around 1%.The research found that if emissions are not curbed, San Francisco and Seattle would both get a 100-year flood every year by 2050, while San Diego would expect 10 such events annually and Key West in Florida would be hit 11 times a year. Some of the worst affected areas would be in Hawaii, with Mokuoloe island, situated off Oahu, forecast to be deluged by 130 floods a year that are currently considered to be 100-year events.Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton climate scientist and co-author of the paper, added that New York City is set to get a 100-year flood every 20 years by 2050 but this frequency would leap to a large flood every other month by 2100.※Most coastal areas will experience relatively large increases in flooding events,§ he said. ※A 40-fold increase on average is gigantic 每 cities may not be able to defend themselves. They will have to spend a lot of money or there will be quite a lot of damage.※Many cities are already behind the eight-ball in terms of preparing for flooding. There will have to be a hard headed look at whether some areas can be defended or will have to be abandoned. Cities are only just starting to grapple with this.§The projections are based upon ※business as usual§ emissions where the world does little to constrain the release of heat-trapping gases from electricity generation, transportation and other activities.In 2013, the  a 1-3ft rise in sea levels by the end of the century if emissions aren＊t properly addressed, although more recent research on the melting and break up of parts of west Antarctica suggests that this increase could be doubled. rise of just a few centimeters is enough to significantly raise the risk of flooding, with the problem exacerbated by an increase in the severity of storms due to a warming, moisture-laden atmosphere.Furthermore, parts of eastern states such as New Jersey, Virginia and Florida are gradually sinking, amplifying the extent of sea-level rise. It＊s now common for places such as Atlantic City and Miami Beach to experience ※sunny day§ flooding, where high tides cause streets to be soaked.The Princeton and Rutgers research found stark flooding variations along the US coast. The eastern seaboard and Gulf of Mexico coast are forecast to suffer a larger amplification of moderate floods, such as those expected every year or every 10 years, rather than more severe floods.The Pacific coast, meanwhile, is set to experience more of the rarer events, such as 500-year floods. There has been a , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), such as the disaster that befell Louisiana last summer. Storms of the magnitude of Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York in 2012, also bring floods expected once in every 500 years, or more.Lead author Maya Buchanan, from Princeton University, said coastal flooding is ※responsible for loss of life and property, as well as long-term damage to local and regional economies and municipal services.§Buchanan added that working out the future frequency of flooding is ※particularly important because coastal infrastructure management, federal flood insurance, and flood risk communications are typically tied to estimates of flood return periods.§In January, Noaa, along with several other federal agencies and universities,  that the oceans could rise by an average of more than 8ft by 2100 under the worst-case climate scenario.

"Drivers should ※think long and hard§ before buying a diesel car and instead consider purchasing a low-emission vehicle, the transport secretary has said, as the government considers a strategy to tackle air pollution. Chris Grayling＊s intervention took place as  that tens of thousands of London＊s children were attending schools in areas with levels of toxic air in breach of EU legal limits. The minister also said the government had a legal duty to cut emissions of nitrogen oxide from diesel cars, which account for four in 10 vehicles on British roads, after a high court ruling in November ordered the authorities to reduce levels of the toxic fume in the ※shortest possible time§. Speaking to Saturday＊s Daily Mail, he said: ※People should take a long, hard think about what they need, about where they＊re going to be driving and should make best endeavours to buy the least polluting vehicle they can. ※I don＊t think diesel is going to disappear but someone who is buying a car to drive around a busy city may think about buying a low-emission vehicle rather than a diesel.§ No 10 is also understood to be considering a scrappage scheme for diesel cars that would see drivers offered a cash incentive for replacing an old diesel car with a low-emission alternative in a bid to improve the country＊s air quality. It is expected to publish an official strategy in the coming weeks.Last week London＊s mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced plans to  on older, polluting cars entering central London on weekdays from October this year. Speaking about the forthcoming T-charge, Khan said: ※It＊s staggering that we live in a city where the air is so toxic that many of our children are growing up with lung problems.

The Department for Transport investigation found all of the 37 top-selling diesel cars tested exceed the legal limit required for laboratory tests when driven for 90 minutes on normal roads. Ministers insisted no laws had been broken by the manufacturers as cars are only required to meet the lab test regulations.

"Poland＊s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, whom green activists have criticised for allowing large-scale logging in the ancient Bia?owie?a forest, has called for the woodland to be stripped of Unesco＊s natural heritage status, banning human intervention.Bia?owie?a, straddling Poland＊s eastern border with Belarus, includes one of the largest surviving parts of the primeval forest that covered the European plain 10,000 years ago. It also boasts unique plant and animal life, including the continent＊s largest mammal, the European bison.※The Bia?owie?a forest was granted  natural heritage status illegally and without consulting the local community,§ Szyszko said in a statement, after having announced that ※a complaint had been lodged with the prosecutor＊s office§ regarding the matter.Szyszko said he found it contradictory for the forest to have Unesco natural heritage status 每 which bans any human intervention 每 and simultaneously belong to the EU＊s  of protected areas, which according to Szyszko allows the current logging.The Polish government has said it authorised the logging, which began in May last year, to contain damage caused by a spruce bark beetle infestation and to fight the risk of forest fires. But scientists, ecologists and the EU have protested and activists allege the logging is a cover for commercial cutting of protected old-growth forests.Szyszko would like to see Bia?owie?a granted a different Unesco status 每 mixed natural-cultural heritage 每 ※and not just natural because man＊s activity is visible to the naked eye in this forest§, he said.Greenpeace, whose activists chained themselves to woodcutting equipment this month to block the logging, immediately denounced Szyszko＊s statement as ※further manipulation§. The environmental group also said logging was in fact out of line with the Natura 2000 rules.※This is an attempt by the minister to impose his own narrative,§ said activist Katarzyna Ko?ciesza of the ClientEarth environmental group.Szyszko＊s statement comes two weeks before the annual Unesco world heritage session, which this year will take place in the southern Polish city of Krak車w. The forest gained the coveted ※natural heritage§ label in 2011.Unesco has previously expressed concern over the logging, as has the European commission, which in April warned Warsaw that it could take legal action to halt the logging."																																																			
"ildlife-based tourism is growing rapidly worldwide as the number of tourists continues to grow and as we, as travellers, seek out new and more enriching personal experiences with local cultures and wildlife. This is what inspired me to take six months unpaid leave from the grind of legal practice many years ago and backpack around South America with my little sister. Experiencing the natural beauty of places like the Amazon rainforest, Iguaz迆 Falls and Machu Picchu and the local people fighting to protect them was life-changing. The UN World Tourism Organisation estimates that 7% of world tourism relates to wildlife tourism, growing annually at about 3%, and much higher in some places, like our Unesco world heritage sites. A WWF report shows that 93% of all natural heritage sites support recreation and tourism and 91% of them provide jobs. In Belize, more than  are said to be supported by income generated through reef-related tourism and fisheries. I＊ve just come back from the Northern Rangelands Trust in Kenya, where I saw amazing work with local communities to protect wildlife. The trust＊s mix of funding includes almost 30% of revenue coming from tourism. It employs over 1,000 Kenyans. I spoke with local people who told me that the rhino and the elephant bring them security, healthcare and education, and no one must interfere with these animals. They are today the best protectors of the wildlife, working with local rangers. Their development is being achieved through conservation.The result: in this region elephant poaching is down by 50%. No rhinos have been poached for four years. Tourism revenue is growing. And it is not the only example: wonderful examples of success exist in many other places, including in the Chitwan national park in Nepal, where again local people are front and centre.But the very assets that underpin this wildlife-based tourism 每 the wildlife itself 每 are under severe threat. The threats come from a multitude of sources: habitat loss, pollution, infrastructure, climate change, over-exploitation and illegal trade, the most immediate threat to wildlife. If we lose the wildlife, we lose the wildlife-based tourism and the jobs that goes with it.The surge in illegal wildlife trade witnessed in recent years is industrial in scale and is driven by transnational organised criminals. They target high-value wildlife without regard for the animals or people＊s lives. They corrupt local officials, recruit and arm local poachers, plunder local wildlife, create insecurity and put local communities into a poverty spiral.The international community is fighting back. There is a global collective effort underway to take on these criminals. But they are hard to beat. We cannot rely on law enforcement alone. We need the private sector, especially the transport, travel and tourism sectors, to join the fight. Many in the transport sector, especially airlines, have come on board largely thanks to HRH the Duke of Cambridge, through his Transport Task Force initiative. It is an inspired initiative that has seen the likes of the president of Emirates Airlines standing up for wildlife and even painting four of his planes with . The tourism sector must join us as well, as must each one of us, as tourists.It is true that, if poorly managed, tourism can have negative impacts on wildlife and the environment, as we have seen in the Galapagos, where there sheer volume of tourists poses a serious threat to the islands＊ unique wildlife. But on a crowded planet of over 7 billion people, growing to over 9 billion, we need viable land use options that support wildlife, and wildlife-based tourism is a critical part of the mix in ensuring the survival of wildlife and in fighting wildlife crime.Well-managed wildlife-based tourism can offer an economic opportunity that supports wildlife. It must be responsibly managed and operators must engage with staff, customers and, most importantly, local people. Staff can be eyes and ears for the police, and customers can stop buying illegally or unsustainably sourced wildlife products. Engaging local people is the key, and that takes effort.Evidence shows that when  they will be the best , as is evident in the Northern Rangelands Trust. Many wildlife destinations are remote from capitals, where there may be limited employment opportunities. This may open up opportunities for tourist operators. They can invest in local communities in a way that will benefit them, benefit wildlife and benefit their business.Tourism operators have the power to lift local people out of poverty in a manner that will be mutually beneficial and self-sustaining. Or they can choose not to engage with local communities and to invest in a manner that sees all of the profits go offshore 每 in which case I would say they are no better than the poachers and the smugglers.The reality is that the tourism sector is not a fringe player in the fight against illegal wildlife trade 每 it is right at the centre of it. Tourism operators are on the front line of this fight along with the customs and rangers and inspectors. How operators engage with their staff, customers and local communities, and where they choose to invest, can change the trajectory of the survival of our wildlife. By doing the right thing tourism operators will not just be protecting wildlife. They will be investing in maintaining the core natural asset that underpins their own wildlife tourism venture.

In Britain, Theresa May faced criticism for not signing up to a joint declaration by , France and Italy in opposition to the US move. A Downing Street source defended the prime minister, pointing out that other countries including Japan and Canada had not signed up to the letter either.In 2015,  in order to prevent the runaway climate change that  or more above the pre-industrial era. In a worst case scenario, the US withdrawal could add 0.3C to global temperatures by the end of the century, the UN World Meteorological Organisation said.Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, described Trump＊s withdrawal from the Paris pact as a big mistake, but said the fight against climate change would continue with or without the US. ※Strong transatlantic ties are far more important and far more durable than the latest unfortunate decisions of the new administration,§ Tusk said, as he addressed a joint press conference with the Chinese prime minister, Li Keqiang, at the end of an EU-China summit in Brussels.※China and  have demonstrated solidarity with future generations and responsibility for the whole planet,§ Tusk added, in reference to a joint EU-China statement that vowed to ※step up§ efforts on global warming, including the raising of $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries cut emissions.Li pointedly told reporters that China believed in abiding by international rules. ※There have been changes in the international situation and there have been rising uncertainties and destabilising factors and in such circumstances it is important for China-EU relations to become more stable§, he said. Miguel Arias Ca?ete, the European commissioner for climate action, said the global agreement would not be allowed to fall at the whim of a domestic election. ※The Paris agreement is fit for purpose,§ the Spanish politician said, gripping a copy of the document that 195 countries have pledged to support. ※The Paris agreement is here to stay. The 29 articles of this Paris agreement are not to be renegotiated. They are to be implemented. That＊s what the EU will do.§He added: ※The fight against climate change cannot depend on the result of elections in one country of another.

" is expected to experience its hottest February day on record this weekend with emergency services on high alert for catastrophic fire conditions.A state-wide total fire ban has been declared for Saturday as the mercury was set to soar past 40C.※If you＊re a little bit inland from the coast in Sydney or the Hunter district, you＊ll experience probably mid-40s,§ senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology Andrew Haigh said. ※That goes for anywhere west of the ranges as well.§The state＊s north-west was set to cop the brunt of the extreme heat with Wilcannia, Ivanhoe, Bourke and Menindee forecast to reach 47C on Saturday.In the Hunter region, Singleton and Cessnock were predicted to reach 46C and 43C on Sunday.The Rural Fire Service has warned of a potential ※catastrophic§ fire danger warning on Sunday largely around the Hunter, from the coast, mid-north coast, out through the Central Tablelands, the top end of the greater Sydney region and out to the central west.The RFS urged residents to have their bushfire survival plans ready. The sizzling conditions will also continue to push the state＊s energy network to limit with demand for power among the highest on record.NSW managed to dodge widespread power blackouts on Friday despite demand reaching unprecedented levels as temperatures reached 45C in western Sydney and 47.4C in the western Riverina town of Hay.The stress on the system was set to persist over the weekend, the Australian Market Energy Operator said, and it warned residents to be mindful of their electricity use.Sydney will get no relief over the weekend with the city forecast to reach 39C on Saturday, and the west to reach the mid-40s.The state＊s Forestry Corporation closed all forests between Sydney and Kempsey in the state＊s north, along with forests in the Pilliga region and the Talleganda state forest on the Southern Tablelands.Saturday＊s Randwick races were postponed to Monday due to concerns about the welfare of horses and riders.Newcastle＊s A-League soccer match against Melbourne Victory was postponed until Monday, while Football NSW cancelled all Saturday trial games for under-18s and below and shifted under-20s and first grade trials to evening start times.NSW＊s three NRL trial matches were set however to go ahead on Saturday evening, as was the Sheffield Shield clash between NSW and . Cricket NSW cancelled all grades of Premier Cricket, while most school and children＊s sport has been cancelled.With many people heading to waterways to cool off in the heat, parents were being urged to keep an eye on children following a tragic summer of drownings.Health experts were reminding people to stay hydrated, wear sunscreen and look out for people most at risk, while NSW clubs said they would provide water and respite for vulnerable people.People with asthma and other respiratory conditions were being urged to take caution with high air pollution levels predicted in Sydney. NSW Health issued the warning, saying high ozone levels were expected on Saturday, leading to poor air quality. ※Parents are advised to limit outside play for children with asthma,§ NSW Health＊s Ben Scalley said in a statement. ※Ozone levels reach their peak about 7 in the evening and tend to be lowest in the morning, so it＊s best to plan outdoor play in the morning when the day is cooler.§Ozone pollution is caused by car exhaust and industrial fumes and gets worse on hot, still days, Scalley said.The heatwave was also expected to push temperatures past 40C in southern Queensland. Heat records could tumble over the weekend, with a strong possibility that the state could record its hottest February day.The weather bureau was forecasting temperatures in the mid-40s in the state＊s south-west and a maximum of 36C in Brisbane on Saturday.The heat was set to rise again on Sunday, with a maximum of 39C forecast for the capital. Temperatures could reach 46C in Birdsville, Queensland, on Saturday and Sunday, nudging the town＊s February heat record of 46.2C and the Queensland record of 46.5C.The sweltering conditions were set to push temperatures 10C past the February average, with paramedics urging people to keep hydrated to avoid becoming ill. They suggested swapping caffeinated drinks for water, eating small and regular meals and wearing light-coloured cotton clothing. ※Heat-related illnesses have the potential to be life-threatening and may include heatstroke,§ Queensland Ambulance Service spokesman, Lachlan Parker, said.Those planning to crank up the air-conditioning were assured they could rely on Queensland＊s power network, which was used to help NSW meet its power needs on Friday. ※We have confidence in the Queensland power system, which is very robust,§ the Queensland energy minister, Mark Bailey, said.Gold Coast beaches closed due to dangerous swells on Friday are expected to reopen on Saturday morning.Relief from the heat in the state isn＊t expected until Tuesday following the arrival of a southerly change and trough from the south-west.In South Australia relief from the heat may be in sight but  with no immediate solution to boosting the reliability of electricity supply.Adelaide and most of the state sweltered through another scorcher on Friday with the city hitting 40C and some regional centres pushing above 46C after similar highs on Wednesday and Thursday.The state avoided blackouts for a second day in a row as the Bureau of Meteorology forecast slightly milder conditions for Saturday ahead of a more significant cool change on Sunday.However, the south-westerlies that will blow through the state will do nothing to cool the debate over the state＊s energy crisis.The federal government continues to blame SA＊s heavy reliance on renewables, which it says has left the electricity network wanting following the closure of the state＊s last coal-fired power station last year.But state energy minister Tom Koutsantonis says its the rules and mismanagement of the electricity market that＊s the problem, and not the availability of power.His government has vowed to go it alone and will detail its plans for ※dramatic§ intervention in the coming weeks.When temperatures first soared in Adelaide on Wednesday about 90,000 consumers across the city and regional SA were unplugged as the Australian Energy Market Operator ordered load shedding to avoid damage to the network. A similar situation was avoided the following night with extra gas generation in SA brought online.People in Victoria＊s north have to suffer through one more day of 40C plus heat before a cool change brings relief.Temperatures have been been scorching for residents in Mildura, who contended with a sticky night before the mercury reached 46C on Friday. Relief isn＊t in sight yet, with the Bureau of Meteorology predicting the border town will reach 43C on Saturday. A cool change shifts the hot weather on by the evening.The state＊s northern towns and cities have been struck by a heatwave, with conditions mostly unchanged since Thursday. Albury Wodonga, Wangaratta and Echuca will see temperatures in the low 40s on Saturday before cooling down by Sunday.State health commander Paul Holman has reminded Victorians to ※remain vigilant§ during the coming days, keeping an eye on elderly people and young children, who are less able to regulate their body temperatures in extreme weather."																																																			
"India＊s environment minister has been accused of playing down the health risks of the country＊s extremely polluted air by claiming, contrary to research, that there is no conclusive data available linking ※death exclusively with air pollution§.The environmental group Greenpeace  in January citing Global Burden of Disease (GBD) research that estimated nearly 1.2 million Indians die each year due to high concentrations of airborne pollutants such as dust, mould spores, arsenic, lead, nickel and the carcinogen .It found that no cities in northern India, and only a handful of regions in the rest of the country, met international air quality standards, with pollution rates particularly high in the capital, , and the neighbouring state Uttar Pradesh.Asked about the report in India＊s upper house, the environment minister, Anil Madhav Dave, said on Tuesday: ※There is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation-ship of death exclusively with air pollution.§He said the health effects of air pollution were a ※synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc of the individuals§.※Air pollution could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory associated ailments and diseases,§ he added.Sunil Dahiya, a campaigner with  India, said the remarks were contrary to the findings of the GBD survey, a comprehensive global research program that monitors the causes of illness and death in every country in the world.The 2015 edition of the survey estimated that 3,283 Indians died each day due to outdoor air pollution, making for around nearly 1.2 million deaths annually. Dahiya said the air pollution estimate controlled for ※all imaginable risk factors, from obesity, to smoking and insufficient consumption of fresh fruit ＃ and many other risks§.※The number of deaths attributed to air pollution in the study are only due to air pollution,§ he said.Researchers have argued that  in particular may increase the likelihood of blood clots, damage the body＊s ability to oxygenate blood and inflame tissue in the nervous system.  has been slower than its neighbour, China, to address the problem of toxic air, which in Delhi is attributed to a range of sources including road dust, vehicle exhaust fumes, open fires, industrial emissions and the burning of crop residues in neighbouring states.But India has taken steps in the past two years to grow its network of air-quality monitors, push cleaner fuels, upgrade vehicle emissions standards and has mandated 每 but not yet fully rolled out 每 new technology to limit emissions from coal-fired power stations.While acknowledging the problem, Indian government bodies have been sensitive about accepting international findings on the issue,  that declared Delhi the world＊s most polluted city. It has also repeatedly had run-ins with Greenpeace, temporarily freezing the NGO＊s funding and accusing it of being one of several groups  India＊s economic growth. Polash Mukherjee, a researcher with the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, said different groups came up with different estimates of the number of deaths caused by air pollution because of varying methodologies or interpretations. ※But what is undeniable is that there is an effect on the health of people,§ he said.The burden of harm from air pollution falls mainly on the poor, the elderly . A report  estimated that poor air quality contributed to the deaths of 600,000 children around the world each year. "

"Plans to ban tiny pieces of plastic that pollute the ocean should be extended to more products that people commonly wash down the drain, campaigners have urged.The government has  and manufacture of products containing plastics known as microbeads that they classify as ※rinse-off§ items, such as shower gel, face scrubs and toothpaste.The move is aimed at  from one source of plastic pollution, as microbeads are washed down the drain and can enter the seas and be swallowed by fish and crustaceans with .But environmental campaigners warned the proposals risked leaving a loophole for the use of  that a survey found were commonly washed off down the drain by consumers.A poll of 2,141 adults for the microbeads coalition of environmental groups revealed that 42% of those who use face make-up such as foundation and concealer wash it off in the sink, bath or shower.About a third of people using lip and eye products wash them off and 60% of adults who do not wear make-up but do use skincare products such as sun cream wash them off down the drain, the survey by YouGov found.The ban should include all products that are washed down the drain or directly discharged into waterways or the marine environment, including a wide range of cosmetics, personal care, cleaning and industrial products, the campaigners urged.Any definition of microbeads should include all solid plastic ingredients smaller than 5mm that are used for any purpose, with no lower size limit in the definition and no allowance for so-called biodegradable plastics to be used as alternatives, they said.There must also be a clear and prompt timeline for phasing out the microbead ingredients, according to the coalition made up of the Environmental Investigation Agency, Fauna & Flora International, Greenpeace UK and the Marine Conservation Society.A statement from the groups said: ※＊Many countries around the world, from India to Korea to New Zealand, are now looking at banning microplastics in products that can end up in the sea, and they＊re looking to the UK to provide a model of how best to do that.※By implementing a robust and comprehensive ban of microplastics in all products which can reach drainage, this government can have a truly global impact.※We＊ve already seen the problematic loopholes in the US legislation, which limited the ban to ＆rinse-off＊ products that perform an ＆exfoliating＊ function and ended up allowing other types of products containing microplastics to keep pouring into our oceans.※With trillions of microplastics already in the sea, this really is a global issue and the British government must seize the opportunity to create a world-leading ban.§"																																																			
"City trees, popularly thought to remove pollutants and improve urban life, may also increase the amount of foul air that people breathe, says the UK body which gives independent health guidance to national and local government.※Leaves and branches slow air currents, causing pollutants to settle. They may also act as sinks for particulates and chemicals that may have direct or indirect effects in air quality. Air quality [under trees] may deteriorate at street level near vehicles,§ says the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence () in new draft guidance for local government to combat air pollution.Nice does not recommend that councils cut down trees in leafy suburbs to meet pollution limits, but urges planners, local authorities and developers to take into account the adverse effect that trees can have on air quality if badly sited or unmanaged.※It is not always true that trees reduce air pollution. Their effect is dependent on factors including species, canopy density, time of year and wind direction. Ventilation [on streets] will vary according to the size, distribution and species of tree and their position,§ it says. The guidelines also question the unintended consequences of other measures often taken by cities to improve people＊s quality of life. Road humps aimed at slowing traffic and noise barriers erected alongside busy roads can both increase air pollution, says Nice.※Traffic calming measures such as speed humps ... may increase emissions by adding to decelerations and accelerations,§ it says. ※Ensuring motorists drive steadily at the optimum speed can reduce stop-go driving and reduce emissions.※People regularly travelling or living downwind of a plume of vehicle pollution can experience poorer air quality as a result of a solid barrier.§The 60-page report, which goes to consultation on Thursday and could be adopted by July, is expected to feed into the government＊s response . Following , the court has demanded faster action to reduce air pollution which causes more than 40,000 early deaths a year in Britain, with conservative estimates putting the cost at between ?8.5bn-?18.6bn.Under pressure from the courts, the government has proposed  in five cities, including Birmingham, Derby, Leeds, Nottingham and Southampton. But Nice recommends that all councils consider setting up similar zones which could allow them to ban heavily polluting vehicles from town centres, and set their own pollution standards for taxis, hire vehicles and council fleets.It proposes that councils consider air pollution at every stage of the planning process. This could extend to where new housing is sited and recommending that developers build new houses with the living room situated furthest away from roads.Schools and nurseries should be sited away from main roads and councils should avoid developments that trap pollution in canyons, says Nice. But it also wants to see drivers educated as to how to reduce emissions. New guidelines are expected to support low and zero emission travel.※Public sector transport providers should educate drivers how to reduce emissions. This could include switching the engine off when they are dropping people off, or making deliveries, and avoiding rapid accelerations and decelerations,§ said a spokesman.However, the committee could not directly address the sheer number of cars now on roads and was limited to proposing ways to mitigate pollution.※We can take steps now to encourage people to walk or cycle rather than drive but these efforts will be futile if we do not have a long-term plan to improve air quality,§ said Mark Baker, director for the centre of clinical practice at Nice.※Past measures have not had the required impact. The draft guidance sets out ... practical measures for local authorities to encourage low or zero emission transport,§ said Paul Lincoln, chair of the Nice guidelines committee.A British Lung Foundation spokesperson said: ※Robust measures must be taken to clean up the air we breathe. We need to specifically target the most polluted areas in our towns and cities. Everyone deserves to breathe clean air.§ ※Action is needed both to ensure vehicles on the road are clean and that there are fewer of them. Diesel vehicles, which are the most polluting, must be phased out and our transport and planning policy needs a radical overhaul,§ said a spokeswoman for Friends of the Earth.※This is no time for tinkering around the edges 每 to deal with this public health crisis we must plan our towns and cities in ways which actually reduce traffic and give people real alternatives to driving.§"																																																			
"Will Donald Trump＊s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate change agreement tip the world into fiery catastrophe? The extraordinary  in tackling global warming, allied with the booming green economy, driven by plummeting renewable energy costs, are strong reasons to think not.A much more likely casualty of Trump＊s choice is the US economy he claims to be protecting: America＊s brilliance at innovation, investment and building businesses will no longer have its government＊s support. The prize of leadership in the 21st-century economy could be sacrificed in a doomed attempt to revive the fossil-fuelled economy of the 20th century.However much , he cannot force companies to build coal-fired power stations if wind and solar are cheaper and executives are smart enough to realise that a billion-dollar bet on a new plant 每 likely to be closed by Trump＊s successor 每 is not a winner.Instead, US states and cities will continue to pursue the green future that secures clean air, water and the promise of climate stability for their citizens. That is no small deal: combined together, California and New York City would be the fourth biggest economy in the world.Climate change is, of course, a global issue but, around the globe, leaders from China to India to Russia to the European Union have lined up to reassert their commitment to confronting the greatest challenge faced by civilisation. Most remarkable is China, the world＊s biggest polluter, which has transitioned from  in recent years.Can China be relied upon to match its words with action? The answer is yes, because its determination is not founded on lofty altruism but the hard-headed need to protect its vast population from the air pollution and looming water and food problems that stem from carbon emissions. Furthermore, China is coming to  energy technology.But the US pullout still undoubtedly brings risks for the rest of the world. There are lots of possible pathways to the zero-emission global economy needed in the second half of this century to avoid the ※§ warned of by the world＊s scientists. But the best is to start early, with global carbon emissions starting to fall by 2020.Even a flattening of the decline in US carbon emissions 每 if not compensated for by other nations 每 will slow progress and might bump up global warming by a tenth of a degree or two. That could be enough to push the most vulnerable nations under the waves of a rising ocean.A rogue US, exporting goods manufactured with dirty energy, might tempt other nations to weaken their climate commitments in order to compete, although there is no sign of this at present. Alternatively, other countries could punish the US with heavy carbon taxes on its exports. But that would prompt retaliation, with unpredictable consequences.The US has also been a major funder of climate aid programmes, which have been vital in winning over developing nations that view global warming as a crisis inflicted on them by industrialised nations. Billions more will have to be contributed by the richest nations.But the breakthrough in Paris 每 getting the unanimous agreement of 196 nations to tackle climate change together 每 remains a deceptively solid foundation for beating global warming, a task that will take decades not years.German environment minister Barbara Hendricks said on Thursday: ※The world＊s climate will survive for eight years without the US.§ But, despite the good reasons for optimism, a one-term Trump presidency would be even safer."																																																			
																																																			
"n an inexplicable abdication of any semblance of responsibility or leadership, Donald Trump has announced that he will begin the process to , joining Nicaragua and Syria as the only world countries rejecting the agreement. It now seems inevitable that the history books will view Trump as America＊s worst-ever president.Trump＊s withdrawal from the Paris treaty is a mostly symbolic act. America＊s pledges to cut its carbon pollution were non-binding, and  for America to meet its initial Paris climate commitment for 2025. The next American president in 2020 can re-enter the Paris treaty and push for policies to make up some of the ground we lost during Trump＊s reign.However, withdrawing from the Paris treaty is an important symbolic move 每 a middle finger to the rest of the world, and to future generations. America is . Ironically, on the heels of  to the organization, America has announced that we won＊t do our fair share to curb the climate change threats that we are the most responsible for.And the GOP has become the Party of Trump. His decision was reinforced by  from 22 Republican senators urging withdrawal from the Paris climate treaty. Those senators have coincidentally received .Their reasoning was dubious at best, arguing that environmental attorneys will cite the international agreement in their efforts to prevent the Trump administration from eliminating President Obama＊s Clean Power Plan. By law,  under the Clean Air Act, because it poses a threat to public welfare. The Republican Senators wrote:As National Resource Defense Council climate and clean air program senior attorney  explained to me, this argument is nonsense:It＊s difficult to discern the Republican Senators＊ motivations behind this letter. Even big  and  and  companies supported America staying in the Paris agreement. Industries don＊t like the uncertainty involved in lurching in and out of international treaties, and experts are concerned about the effect on America＊s international influence from tearing up this critically important agreement that we helped broker less than two years ago, that was signed by nearly every world country. Perhaps the Republican Senators are trying to ride Trump＊s nationalist, anti-globalist coattails. Maybe they think that their right-wing base will be excited if they stick it to the rest of the world on Paris. However, majorities of voters in every single county in the US , and 71% of Americans () think the US should participate in the Paris agreement.In short, efforts to pull out of the Paris treaty are woefully misguided, and almost everyone knows it. Everyone except 42% of Senate Republicans including leader Mitch McConnell, James Inhofe, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and of course Trump＊s senior advisor Steve Bannon and his EPA administrator Scott Pruitt. Additionally,  and  are not fans of the treaty. Those two factors may best explain this decision by Trump and the Republican senators.Political calculations aside, pulling America out of the Paris agreement is grossly immoral. Human-caused climate change puts the well-being of our children and grandchildren at risk. That＊s especially true for  to its impacts, and that contributed the least to the problem. However, the move will also , as Joseph Robertson wrote on these pages earlier this week:Some Republican leaders are struggling to preserve their party＊s credibility and viability. Senators  (R-AZ) and  (R-SC) warned against the withdrawal. 20 House Republicans have now joined , whose goal is to craft economically beneficial climate policies that both parties can support. And a group of  including Secretaries of State and Treasury to Presidents Reagan, George HW Bush, and George W Bush met with the White House seeking support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax plan. So far, these leaders＊ laudable efforts have failed. Trump and the majority of Republicans in Congress are doing everything they can to increase American carbon pollution. They want to repeal all of America＊s climate policies . In short, they＊re happy to let the world burn, and for our children and grandchildren suffer the consequences.This is the rotten state of today＊s GOP. They＊re happy to sell out the future of humanity for their own short-term political gain.  每 the Republican Party may be the most dangerous organization in human history. This move comes at a time when the need to act on global warming has been clear for decades, but the GOP has blocked all American climate policy efforts, and we＊re now running out of time to avoid dangerous climate change.America＊s withdrawal from the Paris treaty will take four years, meaning that the 2020 election (and the 2018 midterms) will be a referendum on Trump＊s decision today. American voters must send the world a signal in that election. In the meantime, it will be up to the rest of the world -  - to take up the mantle of leadership on climate change that America has left behind."																																																			
"The UK is set to reap the whirlwind of climate change with the huge damage caused by wind storms expected to increase sharply, according to new analysis.Even the minimum global warming now expected 每 just 1.5C 每 is projected to raise the cost of windstorm destruction by more than a third in parts of the country. If climate change heats the world even further, broken roofs and damaged buildings are likely to increase by over 50% across a swathe of the nation.The research shows all of the UK is on track to see rises in high winds except the south and south-west, with the greatest impact across the Midlands, Yorkshire and Northern Ireland. This is because the main storms that barrel in off the Atlantic are expected to move their track northwards as the planet warms, a phenomenon linked to the rapid melting being seen in the Arctic.Flooding is the most high-profile impact of climate change on the UK. But the overall cost of wind storms is actually higher, as a result of a much larger number of smaller incidents, and currently runs at an average of about ?1bn a year. Extreme wind storms can occur, though, and  resulted in 47 deaths, as well as more than ?2bn of insured damage and many millions more in damage to roads, power lines and uninsured properties.The  was commissioned by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), which is concerned by the rising impacts of climate change on its customers, and was carried out by the consultancy Air Worldwide and the UK Met Office.※It is absolutely a concern that we are going to be living in a world where overall there are higher wind storm losses,§ said Matt Cullen, the ABI＊s head of strategy. ※That inevitably transfers through to insurers having to raise premiums and hold more capital. We want to make sure we live in a world where risk is controlled and understandable and we can offer insurance in a reliable and sensible way.§Homes and buildings have lifespans of many decades and so work done now should make them better able to withstand the buffeting of severe winds, Cullen said. He said there was a concern that, while the risks of climate change are now being included in policies, there was little to ensure the protections needed are actually implemented. The research used sophisticated  climate models to examine how wind storms are likely to change in frequency and intensity with different levels of global warming. ※We will probably see an overall reduction in the number of storms, but an increase in the frequency of the most intense storms, and of course those are the ones that cause the [most] damage,§ said Peter Sousounis, director of meteorology at Air Worldwide.This data was then used to calculate the changes expected in the cost of damage resulting from the stronger storms and the researchers found significant increases in most parts of the UK. This was not entirely unexpected, said Sousounis.※We have seen enough results from catastrophe models to really not be surprised. Small changes in wind speed can have a huge impact on losses,§ he said. ※Losses go up almost exponentially with increasing wind speed.§Cullen said: ※The likelihood of claims resulting from severe storms increasing in the future is something the insurance industry, and society, need to start preparing for now. Planners and builders should be aware of the need for more wind-resistant construction in specific areas of the country if claims are to be kept to a minimum and residents spared the distress and expense of higher levels of wind damage.§The government＊s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change,  for the inevitable impacts of global warming in coming decades, including floods, deadly annual heatwaves and water shortages. It also warned: ※Any increases in maximum wind speeds with climate change experienced during storms would have significant implications for many infrastructure networks,§ such as roads and railways and power and communication lines."																																																			
"There was tremendous outcry when the New York Times hired opinion columnist Bret Stephens, who has a long history of . Stephens didn＊t assuage those fears when he , absurdly suggesting that our lack of progress on climate policy is a result of greens being too mean to climate deniers.Stephens lamentably stayed on the subject of climate change in his  and  Times columns as well. In those pieces, he used corn-based ethanol subsidies as an example of where climate policy has gone wrong:This is a clear case of cherry picking. There are hundreds of examples of climate policies with varying degrees of effectiveness; why focus on just one? Many environmental groups and ※climate-change activists§ have long opposed corn-based ethanol subsidies, as Stephens himself noted. Politicians of both political parties supported those subsidies because they were popular in corn-growing Midwestern states. It had little if anything to do with climate efficacy. So why blame ※climate-change activists§ for these politically-motivated subsidies?For his next misleading argument, Stephens shifted to German electricity costs:Stephens＊ comparison to 2009 is another example of blatant cherry picking. German carbon emissions that year were particularly low, due in part to the global recession. The long-term trend is unmistakable:It＊s also odd that Stephens criticized Germany for its electricity bills, given that the report he referenced shows . The difference is that while German electricity rates are 3.3 times higher than Americans＊, their electricity consumption is 3.4 times lower. In other words, German policies have been successful in cutting the nation＊s carbon pollution while still keeping their electricity bills a bit lower than Americans＊. The country is far from perfect 每  for a significant amount of that electricity generation 每 but from a climate policy perspective, Germany is mostly a success story. America＊s per-person carbon pollution is nearly twice as high as Germany＊s.Although his columns are riddled with these sorts of misleading cherry picks, worse yet is that Stephens＊ arguments are , distracting from the elephant in the room. Stephens＊ columns worry that America will jump on the bandwagon of any feel-good climate policy. If only we lived in a world where that were a legitimate concern. In reality, the Trump administration is taking every possible step to undo all American climate policies. They＊re  because they believe it won＊t allow America to increase its carbon pollution. The administration has effectively  and our future well-being. Noam Chomsky has called the Republican Party the most dangerous organization in human history because of its climate denial and policy obstruction.Stephens＊ focus on corn-based ethanol is like a cancer patient worrying about a hangnail. Certainly, all parties should debate the best and most effective policies to address climate change. We＊ve been  to engage in that debate. Democrats have proposed all sorts of different policy solutions - government regulations, free market cap and trade systems (), small government  - you name it. They＊re not the problem. Fortunately, some prominent Republicans have stepped up to engage in the climate policy debate. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham authored past climate legislation. 19 House Republicans have joined , 12 of whom just introduced  that would establish a commission to recommend economically viable climate policies. And a group of Republican elder statesmen on  to recommend support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax.However, while deserving of great praise and encouragement for their efforts, these climate realist Republican Party leaders are in the minority. The question is whether they can wrest control of the party away from the climate deniers and policy obstructionists before too much damage is done to the Earth＊s climate and the future prospects of the GOP.The Republican Party used to be conservative on environmental issues, as Tea Party co-founder Debbie Dooley has noted:On this issue, the conservative approach requires major efforts to cut carbon pollution. Merely investing in research and clean technologies, as Stephens supports, is grossly insufficient. It＊s worthwhile to challenge New York Times readers＊ notions and worldviews, but not if it＊s done in an intellectually dishonest way on the greatest existential problem we face today. Stephens could use his platform and influence to try and reverse his party＊s policy obstruction; instead he＊s chosen to  Times readers. They expect and deserve much better."																																																			
"Speaking Darwinistically, the planet should have no truck with the spodoptera genus, commonly known as armyworms. Fat, slow over the ground and unspeakably terrible looking, they should never have evolved into anything more than an entomological pilot project. In some variants, their heads resemble human brains that have been caramelized with a blowtorch. Mandibles, jammed into the bottom of the face part, glisten with alien goo. In their most gregarious morphological variation, black and dun stripes run down their bodies, mimicking something an avid golfer would wear to a funeral. They are speckled with sparse little hairs, like the budding moustache of a teenage Lothario, while their stubby legs appear to have been distributed randomly, and without consideration for balance and mobility.Unfortunately, as it happens, armyworms do not appear fat and ugly to each other 每 or not, following one of nature＊s great acts of mercy, when they＊ve hatched into the world＊s most boring looking moth. They reproduce at a staggering rate, with each female laying about 1000 eggs in a 10-day lifetime. And though they may be slow crawlers, they are strong fliers. Every year spodoptera frugiperda, or the fall armyworm, travels from Mexico to Canada, a distance of at least 3000km.But if they have a dominant evolutionary superpower, it is rapacious communalism: in their larval stage, they advance in squadrons, platoons, battalions, armies 每 tens of millions storming the countryside, eating every crop or garden they can get their mandibles on. Most pests will consume only the good bits, but armyworms will strip even a fully-grown maize plant down to the last leaf. Spodoptera have proved to be a blight in North America, South America, the Middle East, the South Pacific islands, Australia 每 pretty much everywhere. There are five species of armyworms, but we＊re concerned here with the aforementioned frugiperda which is headquartered in North and South America; and the exempta, usually based in Africa. Spodoptera exempta 每 the African armyworm 每 specialises in cereals, and has been causing havoc on the continent for decades now, spreading out slowly from the east and in 2009 sparking a state of emergency in Liberia. The new arrival, however, is spodoptera frugiperda, more commonly and chillingly known as ＆the fall＊. This variant, which eats pretty much anything, has enjoyed a long, awful history in South America 每 managing it costs the Brazilian economy a staggering $600 million a year. In January 2016 it was detected for the very first time in Africa, in Nigeria. (As for how it it got there from the Americas, it either flew in on prevailing winds, or caught a plane. No one is yet sure). By April 2016, the pest had travelled to several other West African countries and to Central Africa. By December, it was detected in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi, and was storming South Africa＊s borders. Last week, Ghana＊s parliament was asked by the minister of agriculture to declare , and take urgent action as the fall arrived en masse. But why this particular plague, and why now? Is it the newish mash-up between local and invasive species that has produced such unstoppable consumption machines? Or has modern farming 每 in particular, modern African farming, which depends increasingly on planting vast tracts of a single staple 每 made it easier for them to advance? In regions stricken by climate change, and which in some parts have recently suffered (or, in some cases, is still suffering through) a once-in-a-generation drought, are armyworms not just another manifestation, albeit the most revolting, of the colossal challenges facing Africans as the world warms? At this stage, no one is really sure certain how best to answer these questions. But there is one last, and far more pressing, problem: can the armyworms be stopped before they eat Africa bare? If there is a three-star general currently conducting the war against genus spodoptera, it must be a. According to his university profile, Wilson ※ is fascinated by the interactions between parasites and their hosts, be they insects, birds, mammals or humans.§ He first became interested in African armyworms after studying their migration through Kenya 25 years ago. The sweetener, as far as his particular discipline was concerned, was the armyworm＊s achilles＊ heel: when he tried to transport live specimens back to a lab in Nairobi, he found that they would succumb to a virus, and none of them would survive the journey. There was a devastating natural loop at work here: a voracious parasite was felled, and easily so, by a voracious infectious agent. His work began to echo almost exactly the plot of HG Wells＊ War of the Worlds, in which invading Martians are eventually killed off by microbial infection to which they had no immunity 每 ※slain, after all man＊s devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.§Wilson, who is currently in the field in Tanzania, remains in equal measures enthralled and terrified by these critters. ※I got to wondering how armyworms could be such a devastating pest when they seemed so susceptible to this virus,§ he explained over email, ※and I have been studying the interaction between armyworms and their viruses ever since.§His research suggested that the obvious solution to any armyworm infestation was to replicate the virus, and employ it as a biological agent in order to eradicate the blight. But this was easier said than done, and his research was anyway focused exclusively on the African armyworm. The recent introduction of the fall into the African theatre served, according to Wilson, ※as the latest twist.§And not a good twist. Given that the fall has only been in Africa since January 2016, no one is quite sure how severe the impact will be. ※People are rightly scared about what＊s going to happen,§ Wilson told me.Making matters worse, armyworms tend to love maize, the local staple. The practice of monoculture farming 每 lots and lots of maize, as far as the eye can see 每 is a key component to any form of industrial agriculture. But it has provided the African armyworm, which specialises in cereals, with a continent-wide all-you-can-eat buffet. ※For the many farmers who also grow small amounts of other crops such as beans, peas and other vegetables, their livelihoods were safeguarded to an extent by these other crops,§ Wilson explained. ※But the fall armyworm has a much broader host range§每 translation: it＊ll eat anything 每 ※so potentially can also eat these other crops if maize is not available.§ This attack on regional food security has been compounded by an X factor: climate change. ※Drought followed by lots of rain is perfect for armyworms,§ said Wilson, describing exactly the kind of weather conditions that are becoming the sub-Saharan norm. And so, in dry years, African crops suffer for the obvious reasons. In non-drought years, there are still the armyworms to contend with. Southern Africa＊s recent drought, vicious by any estimation, was broken by the tropical cyclone Dineo, which touched down on the coast of Mozambique mid-February. Much of the region was swamped with massive, in some cases unprecedented, amounts of rainfall. Undaunted 每 nay, encouraged 每 onward marched the armyworm.When the infestation was detected in South Africa in January, it did not come as a surprise to the  (Daff), who had effectively posted wanted posters throughout the agricultural community in preparation for a first sighting. The fall armyworm was already listed as a quarantine pest for South Africa in terms of the Agricultural Pests Act 1983. After the first suspected specimens were collected on a farm in the northern province of Limpopo, Daff requested a diagnostic report from the Agricultural Research Council, Plant Protection Research Institute (Arc PPRI), which on February 3 confirmed the armyworm＊s identity. Daff had already constructed a sort of historical narrative regarding the outbreak, which squared with Kenneth Wilson＊s and other expert assessments. Relying on a worst case scenario, which had been realised in other countries as the worm made its way south, Daff thus informed commodity and research organisations of a possible threat, and encouraged farmers to report suspicious pest damage. Serendipitously, Daff had recently introduced the South African Emergency Plant Pest Response Plan, which was designed to diagnose and detect new pest infestations. Wisely, the government treated the outbreak as a crisis, and detection was just the first in what was necessarily a tiered attack. According to Makenosi Maroo, Daff＊s chief director, stakeholder relations and communications, the department set up an internal joint operations centre, along with a steering committee that included ※research, industry and provincial government role players§. But if African armyworms were the known known, the fall was the known unknown 每 there was no protocol in South African on how best to halt its progress.As ever, the fallback option was to nuke them with chemicals. But which chemicals? ※As the fall armyworm is a new pest to South Africa, no pesticide was previously registered to be used against it,§ said Daff minister Senzeni Zokwana, during a hastily called press conference on 6 February. ※A process of emergency registration of agricultural chemicals is ongoing with two active ingredients already registered to be applied against this pest. As with all agricultural remedy applications the label instructions must be followed in accordance to the supplier＊s recommendations.§Which was sound advice. But given that the effectiveness of the pesticide regime was still largely speculative, South Africa was due a lucky break. And the country got one due to a quirk in the harvesting schedule: the bulk of the season＊s maize crop was unaffected and already drying for harvest, which meant that the armyworms were late for dinner. And there was more good news, at least as far as South Africa was concerned: the country produces most of its maize crop in areas where frost occurs, and armyworms can＊t handle the cold. But in the warmer northern provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, to say nothing of the rest of the continent, this was hardly an upside worth mentioning. Still, Hamlet Hlomendlini, a spokesperson at AgriSA, a local lobby group, seemed to feel that the crisis was not much of a crisis at all. ※We don＊t see it as a threat right now,§ he told me. ※We feel that the department of agriculture is on top of it, and it was restricted to a few isolated farms in Limpopo. It was a question of finding the right pesticides. It seems like things are under control.§ This would likely sound like an excess of sanguinity to Wilson. When I asked him how seriously African policymakers should be taking the armyworm blight, he was unambiguous. ※Very.§Nothing is certain at this point, but it＊s clear that the infestation is spreading rapidly, without respite. A state of emergency has just been declared in Ghana. But the real kicker is that fall and African armyworms, as Wilson puts it, ※have teamed up to provide a deadly double act.§ This entomological suicide squad will cost a lot of money to control, and if they aren＊t kept in check, the stakes get higher. From Africa, said, Wilson, ※it＊s possible that they will spread to Southern Europe, with seasonal migrations into northern Europe and possibly also into Asia.§There＊s some hope of nailing down an effective pesticide regimen, but that comes with its own problems 每 poisoning the environment, pollinators, livestock and humans not minor among them. Besides, the fall is resistant to many of the chemicals currently being deployed across the continent. With this in mind, Wilson and his collaborators have been working on a biopesticide derived from the natural disease that was killing his specimens in Kenya all those years ago. By his own admission, this is a time-consuming and expensive pursuit. At the moment, Wilson is in Tanzania battle-testing the new weapon. ※We are currently at the stage where we are asking some fundamental questions,§ he told me. ※Will the armyworms develop resistance to the biopesticide in the same way as insects often do against chemicals? Will the virus evolve to be less effective if we produce lots of it under field conditions? And can we make the biopesticide more effective by formulating it in a different way?§The armyworm is not waiting for Wilson and his team. And while the outbreak is apparently under control in South Africa, no other African country can match Daff＊s sophistication. The Central African Republic is in the midst a long-simmering civil war; Zimbabwe is in perennial economic free-fall; and even boring Zambia is undergoing political instability. Next year, according to the experts, a drought beckons. The world＊s ugliest worm thrives on exactly this kind of chaos."																																																			
"The world＊s leading shipping organisation has been condemned by environmental campaigners and MEPs for its failure to urgently tackle the industry＊s impact on climate change, after it agreed only to a partial reduction in harmful emissions from ships.The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), meeting in London, agreed to , which are a cause of , but on greenhouse gases agreed only to some further monitoring and a fresh round of negotiations. Potential measures to reduce greenhouse gases have been delayed to 2023, which campaigners said was too late.Sulphur will be capped at 0.5% of shipping fuel content from 2020, not 2025 as some companies and countries had urged. .Bill Hemmings, of the campaigning group Transport and Environment, welcomed the move: ※The decision reduces the contribution of shipping to the world＊s air pollution from about 5% to 1.5% and will save millions of lives in the coming decades. Now the focus should shift towards implementing this decision.§It is not clear how the sulphur cap will be implemented or policed.No agreement was reached on . Shipping is a fast-growing source of greenhouse gases, projected to account for 17% of global emissions by 2050, though the industry has long been omitted from international agreements on climate change, including the UN＊s Paris accord signed last year and due to come into force next month.Instead, IMO members agreed to further monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions data from international shipping, with a view to drawing up an action plan to reduce them. But that plan is not likely to be implemented before 2023. The IMO first began to make plans to reduce emissions in 2003, yet little action has been taken. Shipowners and shipping companies want to guard any data they collect on fuel consumption, seeing it as a competitive issue.Sotiris Raptis, shipping officer at Transport and Environment, said: ※This can in no way be seen as a proper response to the challenge laid down by the Paris climate agreement. The International Maritime Organisation is proposing to stall any action until 2023. The decision to delay by at least a further seven years any agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping constitutes an abject failure by national governments and the shipping industry.§Jytte Guteland, a Socialist MEP, said the agreement was not enough: ※The shipping sector must play its role in Europe＊s transition to a low-carbon society. Time is of the essence, and in the absence of IMO action, the EU must include ships＊ emissions in its 2030 climate target. By setting up a climate fund for shipping, Europe can help industry cut carbon in a cost-effective way.§Bas Eickhout, a Green MEP, added his support for unilateral action from the EU: ※International shipping is the only transport sector not contributing to climate goals in Europe. Since the IMO will not be considering, let alone proposing, any emissions reduction measures for many years to come, our duty is to make sure that Europe takes action.§Both shipping and aviation have been excluded from international negotiations on climate change, partly due to the difficulty in allocating their emissions to a particular country, but also because of the reluctance of both industries 每 which continue to grow strongly as globalised trade increases 每 to submit to the international monitoring that climate change regulation requires.The aviation industry this month . The International Civil Aviation Organisation agreed that airlines would have to offset some of their emissions by buying carbon credits, which require investment in carbon-reduction schemes such as growing new forests and installing new renewable energy. The shipping industry has been slower to adopt such measures.Shipping fuel is much heavier and thicker than aircraft fuel, and produces more greenhouse gases. Airlines have an economic incentive to use the lightest fuel possible, which can include biofuels derived from plants. But ships are capable of carrying the heavier, more polluting 每 and, crucially, cheaper 每 fuel on long voyages, so there is little economic incentive for the industry to change its practices."																																																			
"e often forget we ourselves are animals. Perhaps this is what makes it easier to eat them, wear them and experiment on them. Some of the more hardcore carnivores will loudly claim that the taste of a bacon sandwich is worth committing any cruelty for, but most of us eat meat while averting our gaze from its source.Of course, we are not alone in eating other animals. Many other species have a meat-based diet 每 even some species of plant. Animals eating other animals is a critical part of the food web. But humans have twisted their natural inclination into a highly destructive, carnivorous, corporate machine.Some people forswear meat for health reasons, and some, , see the killing of animals and humans in a similar light. But it starts to get more difficult to separate fact from fiction when we focus on the environmental impacts of livestock. They are a major contributor of carbon emissions, certainly, but placing the blame for climate change entirely on cattle farming is misleading.When it comes to farm animal numbers, the statistics are frightening. The world＊s average stock of chickens is almost 20bn, or three per person. Cattle are the next most populous breed of farm animal at 1.4bn, with sheep and pigs not far behind at around 1bn each. And farm animals that are raised intensively require a staggering amount of animal feed and water. Soya production, mainly for animal feed, has devastated ecosystems in Latin America. All in all, livestock production occupies the vast majority of agricultural land and is the main reason why 50% of the wildlife we share our planet with has disappeared since the start of the industrial revolution.As a result there is a general consensus that eating less meat and dairy produce is one of the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, feed 7 billion-plus people and protect biodiversity. And the focus, up until now, has been on cattle rather than pigs and poultry. This is partly because ruminants or grass-eaters emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Cattle farms have also been responsible for large-scale destruction of important ecosystems both directly for grazing and indirectly for animal feed. The expansion of cattle farming in the Amazon, for example, has been responsible for one-eighth of all forest destruction globally in recent times.So there is no denying that cattle have caused extensive environmental damage in many parts of the world. And over-grazing of cattle, especially in drought-prone regions, has been a significant cause of soil degradation. Soil is key.  is the largest land-based reservoir of carbon on Earth, absorbing it from trees and vegetation as they die and decay. Losses of carbon from chemically intensive use of soils and land-use change from ploughing up grasslands and clearing forests and peatlands constitute the second-largest source of CO after burning fossil fuels. It＊s a little-known fact that soils store four times more carbon than all trees and other life. We will not be able to feed people in the future if the soil continues to be degraded, and we are degrading soils at a faster rate than ever before.Our number one priority has to be to protect the soil, but the destruction of our soil is where the issue of meat becomes a bit less one-sided.The traditional solution to soil exhaustion is crop rotation. Without the use of crop rotations which include grass and legumes, crop production comes to depend more and more on synthetic chemicals: manufactured fertilisers 每 a huge source of climate emissions 每 and heavy use of pesticides to control weeds, pests and diseases.Turning exhausted cropland over to grass pasture can protect soils and build soil carbon, while still producing food. Small numbers of animals that eat grass and arable byproducts which we cannot eat could be good for the environment 每 if they are not displacing critical wildlife habitat such as forests and peatlands. Low-intensity grazing allows fallow land to remain productive, encouraging farmers to protect their soils and reducing the pressure on the land. And if you have pasture anyway, why not use it to give cattle a free lunch?So the distinction diehard carnivores need to make is not between cattle and chickens or pigs but between intensively farmed animals 每 which depend heavily on grain or soya and are therefore in direct competition with humans for land 每 and those that predominantly eat grass or, in the case of pigs, heat-treated swill from our waste food mountains. This means no industrially raised chicken and pork, as . Factory farming is not only unacceptably cruel, but unsustainably inefficient.So for people who are not vegans or vegetarians, but still want to do their best for the planet, the most sustainable option is much smaller quantities of higher-quality, mainly grass-fed meat, along with less dairy, more fruit and vegetables, and less processed food. How much less meat? A lot less. Unless, that is, you can persuade all of your friends to go vegan."																																																			
"Russian metals giant Norilsk Nickel has admitted a spillage at one of its plants was responsible for turning a local river blood red.Russia＊s environment ministry last week , with local activists blaming the nearby Nadezhda metallurgical plant. After initially refusing to confirm a leak, Norilsk Nickel 每 the world＊s biggest producer of nickel and palladium 每 on Monday said heavy rain on 5 September had resulted in water flooding over a filtration dam at the plant and into the river.※Despite the short-term discolouration of the water ... this incident does not present a danger for people or fauna in the river,§ the company said in a statement.Environmental activists, however, insisted that it was too early to judge the environmental impact, since the official investigation was still ongoing. ※You can＊t just say that it＊s no big deal. Right now there is a ministry of environment commission there,§ said  Russia official Alexei Kiselyov.Kiselyov said that investigating pollution from Norilsk Nickel plants was extremely difficult, because its infrastructure was located in remote areas and the firm controlled access to the entire Taymyr peninsula, which lies between the Kara and Laptev seas in the Russian Arctic.Groups representing indigenous populations in the area say that local media went out of their way to whitewash the company and did not inform the public after the accident.※We had a report after it happened that claimed the river colour came [naturally] from clay. That is just laughable to local people,§ said Sidor Chuprin, an indigenous activist.He accused Norilsk Nickel workers of poor safety standards and said locals are concerned about the Daldykan river, because they fish in another river further downstream. ※They don＊t care about polluting, because they all have homes on the mainland,§ he said, referring to central .Chuprin added that there were no environmental officials based on the remote peninsula, and that locals struggled to hold the metals giant to account. ※Of course, this is in their interest,§ he said of Norilsk Nickel. ※We are not experts; all we can do is take a picture.§"																																																			
																																																			
"More than 400 icebergs have drifted into the North Atlantic shipping lanes over the past week in an unusually large swarm for this early in the season, forcing vessels to slow to a crawl or take detours of hundreds of kilometres.Experts are attributing it to uncommonly strong counter-clockwise winds that are drawing the icebergs south, and perhaps also global warming, which is accelerating the process by which  and float away.As of Monday, there were about 450 icebergs near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, up from 37 a week earlier, according to the US Coast Guard＊s international ice patrol in New London, Connecticut. Those kinds of numbers are usually not seen until late May or early June. The average for this time of year is about 80.In the waters close to , the icebergs are forcing ships to take precautions.Instead of cutting straight across the ocean, trans-Atlantic vessels are taking detours that can add around 650km (400 miles) to the trip. That＊s a day and a half of added travel time for many large cargo ships.Close to the Newfoundland coast, cargo ships owned by Oceanex are throttling way back to three or four knots as they make their way to their home port in St John＊s, which can add up to a day to the trip, said executive chairman Captain Sid Hynes.One ship was pulled out of service for repairs after hitting a chunk of ice, he said.  ※It makes everything more expensive,§ Hynes said. ※You＊re burning more fuel, it＊s taking a longer time, and it＊s hard on the equipment.§ He called it a ※very unusual year§.US Coast Guard Commander Gabrielle McGrath, who leads the ice patrol, said she had never seen such a drastic increase in such a short time. Adding to the danger, three icebergs were discovered outside the boundaries of the area the Coast Guard had advised mariners to avoid, she said.McGrath is predicting a fourth consecutive ※extreme ice season§ with more than 600 icebergs in the shipping lanes.Most icebergs entering the North Atlantic have ※calved§ off the Greenland ice sheet. Michael Mann, director of the earth system science center at Pennsylvania State University, said it was possible climate change was leading to more icebergs in the shipping lanes, but wind patterns were also important.In 2014, there were 1,546 icebergs in the shipping lanes 每 the sixth most severe season on record since 1900, according to the patrol.

"The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday  that jet engine exhaust endangers public health by contributing to climate change, a key milestone as it works to develop regulations that will cut carbon emissions from commercial aircraft.Large commercial jets account for 11% of all emissions from the global transportation sector. Aircraft emissions are expected to grow by 50% by 2050 as demand for air travel increases.Regulating aircraft emissions is part of the Obama administration＊s  under the Paris Climate Agreement to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by up to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The international pact aims to to keep global warming from exceeding 2∼C (3.6∼F).※Addressing pollution from aircraft is an important element of US efforts to address climate change,§ Janet McCabe, the EPA＊s acting assistant administrator for air and radiation, said in a statement. ※EPA has already set effective GHG standards for cars and trucks and any future aircraft engine standards will also provide important climate and public health benefits.§Both the EPA and the International Civil Aviation Organization (), are developing regulations that will cut carbon emissions from commercial aircraft. The ICAO is expected to finalise its emissions standards in 2017, but the EPA could not proceed with developing its own standards in the US until it concluded that jet engine exhaust poses a public health threat.Jet engine exhaust emits carbon dioxide, which drives climate change by warming the atmosphere, leading to increasing global temperatures,  and extreme weather. Public health will suffer as  become more frequent and intense, rising seas inundate coastal cities,  lead to more deaths and  burn more forests and reduce air quality.※The endangerment finding is key because it obligates the EPA to take regulatory action to cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft 每 it triggers a legal mandate,§ said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation.New emissions standards may become more important as climate change affects the atmosphere. Studies show that climate change will increase wind speeds in some areas of the globe, forcing airplanes flying through them to burn more fuel. Total global carbon dioxide emissions could see a boost as flight times increase in the stronger winds.The proposed ICAO , supported by the US and 22 other countries, call for a 4% reduction in fuel consumption in new commercial aircraft built after 2028 and from aircraft currently in production delivered after 2023.Airplane makers are already building more fuel efficient aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, and they are expected to already meet the proposed ICAO emissions standards.Kodjak said the ICAO＊s proposed standards will not sufficiently cut airplane emissions to reduce their climate impact, and the EPA＊s process for developing new standards for US airplanes could be an opportunity to make emissions cuts even stricter.US-based aircraft are responsible for 29% of all greenhouse gas emissions from commercial aircraft worldwide, according to the EPA."																																																			
"A coalition of 17 US states filed a legal challenge on Wednesday against efforts by Donald Trump＊s administration to roll back climate change regulations, deepening a political rift over his emerging energy policies. Led by New York state, the coalition said the administration has a legal duty to regulate emissions of the gases scientists believe cause global climate change. ※The law is clear: the EPA must limit carbon pollution from power plants,§ the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said in a statement announcing the challenge. Trump  last week targeting climate change regulations ushered in by President Obama, saying they hinder US energy production and jobs without providing meaningful environmental benefits. The order＊s main target was Obama＊s Clean Power Plan, a law that would require states to slash carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, but which was never implemented because it was challenged in court by 26 Republican-led states. Trump＊s order directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review the regulation to decide whether to ※suspend, rescind, or revise it§. Shortly after, the EPA filed a legal motion asking the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit to delay ongoing court proceedings on the regulation to allow for the review. The New York-led coalition＊s motion on Wednesday asked the court to throw out the EPA＊s request to delay court proceedings, saying the delay ※would waste the substantial resources already expended in this litigation§. ※This case is ripe for decision now, and nothing that EPA has proposed to do obviates the need for this court＊s review,§ according to the statement.

Anyone with a precious cashmere sweater now resembling a piece of lace will sympathise.※We＊ve lost some modern furniture and furnishings, but so far we＊ve kept on top of it with historic textiles by utter scrupulous diligence,§ said Amber Xavier-Rowe, head of collections conservation. ※Our curators are constantly on the lookout, and we have weekly, monthly and major annual conservation cleaning programmes 每 six-monthly in some properties.§The public is invited to collect free moth traps from staffed properties as they reopen for Easter, keep them at home for a few months and then report on their haul .※We really don＊t know exactly why this is happening, which is why we are enlisting the public＊s help. It could be to do with the climate getting warmer, and it could be that we＊re all just so busy we＊re not cleaning at home as much. It＊s not just a problem in this country. I was at a conference in Paris the other week and everyone with collections to care for was talking about it. We had one report of a clothes moths problem from Tehran,§ said Xavier-Rowe.※One possible source is chimneys 每 most of us have open fireplaces, but we don＊t light as many fires, so we don＊t get them cleaned as regularly. Moths love dead birds 每 the larvae eat the feathers, the skin and even the flesh. It＊s very important to identify the source of an outbreak and then deal with it.§When Xavier-Rowe talks about checking textiles, she does not mean a quick reassuring glance: her routine involves checking in the crevices of all furniture, turning back buttons, collars, cuffs and pockets of all garments, as well as checking along seams and binding.Generally, the moths target wool, fur or feathers, but Xavier-Rowe says they will also eat other fabrics if they are dirty: when English Heritage took over , a property in South Yorkshire that had survived almost unaltered and with hoarded possessions for more than a century, they found moths had targeted the carpets, which the previous owner＊s many dogs had urinated on, and munched through the sweat-stained silk underarmlinings of coats. ※I don＊t know why that should be. Maybe the dirt makes it tastier, or more digestible,§ she said.Xavier-Rowe＊s advice to householders is depressing: relentless cleaning, including chimneys, attics and cellars, and moving all furniture to clean underneath at least monthly. She urges against the storage of dirty clothes, but also suggests shaking clean stored garments in boxes and wardrobes at least every six months.Most of the racks of moth repellent now in every supermarket and hardware shops do not work, and those that do are highly toxic, she said. Gentle remedies like lavender help only if they are changed very regularly, she added.※If you do spot the telltale signs, if it＊s a beloved jumper, stick it in the freezer. If not, chuck it.

"Plans to set fire to coal under the seabed at up to 19 sites around the UK would cause significant climate pollution, groundwater contamination and toxic waste, according to a report by environmentalists.The UK government＊s Coal Authority has granted licences for  (UCG) covering more than 1,500 sq km of seabed off north-east and north-west England, Wales and east central Scotland.The Scottish and Welsh governments have put temporary moratoriums on the technology because of concerns about the dangers. Scottish ministers are awaiting an independent review in September, which is likely to be critical of UCG.But a company led by the veteran oil entrepreneur and former owner of the Spectator, Algy Cluff, is pursuing major developments near the shores of northern England.Cluff Natural Resources has licences for nine potential undersea coalfields amounting to 640 sq km, valid until 2018-2020. Two are off the coast near Durham, two off Cumbria, two off Wales and three in the Firth of Forth in .The company said that progress in Scotland ※has been delayed due to local politics§. But it is continuing ※to evaluate the development options for its acreage in England, particularly the north-east of England, which shares many of the commercial advantages of the Firth of Forth projects§.Another 10 licences for UCG around the coast, valid until December this year or January 2018, are held by Five Quarter in Newcastle. Though the company ceased trading in March this year, there are fears that its licences could still be assigned to others.UCG involves drilling boreholes up to 1km deep, setting fire to underground coal seams, and extracting the resulting gas to heat homes. But according to the new report by Friends of the Earth International, it has ※left a trail of destruction in its wake across the world§.The report says that UCG has caused groundwater contamination, subsidence, accidents and toxic waste where it has been deployed in , South Africa and the US. Its total potential carbon dioxide emissions 每 1,650bn tonnes globally, or 46bn tonnes in the UK 每 would wreck efforts to cut climate pollution, it warns. Flick Monk, the report＊s author from  Scotland, said: ※On climate change grounds alone there is no way these plans can possibly make sense. ※Given what we know about this technology＊s terrible history around the world, Cluff＊s plans to burn coal seams off English coasts are utterly reckless. The UK government should stop this industry now before Cluff gets his foot in the door.§But Andrew Nunn, the CEO of Cluff Natural Resources, accused Friends of the Earth of having a predetermined position on fossil fuels. He said: ※We fully expect that this new report will continue to perpetuate that position by ignoring those UCG projects which have proceeded without incident and focusing purely on a small number of projects, which fall well short of the standards that would be required to operate a UCG project in the UK※This is a blatant attempt to influence the public and other stakeholders prior to the publication of the Scottish government＊s independent report on UCG.§"																																																			
																																																			
"t＊s late morning and I＊m driving from Allendale to Hexham along the straight road known as the Paise dyke. Cars bowl along here at speed, but to do that is to miss the far views and the birds. There＊s always something to catch the eye. Ahead, on this warm March morning, starlings swarm like bees across the fields, a rushing wind as I drive under them, about 3,000 birds. The flock is so regularly spaced that I feel a vast net has been cast over me before they settle on a field pocked by mole hills and rich in worms.There＊s a farm and a wood called the Paise but the road＊s name is not on the Ordnance Survey map. In his book published in 1970, Goodwife Hot and Others:Northumberland＊s Past as Shown in Its Place Names the historian and farmer Geoffrey Watson thought the name referred to land where peas were grown. Though these are upland fields, he believed they would have been adequate for growing this staple diet. The dyke might refer to a stone wall or a causeway over the boggy moorland. Passing along the Paise dyke in winter, I look out for  in the roadside hawthorns. Feasting on the crimson berries, the plump black birds look slightly comical and out of proportion to the tough squat trees. On those cold days, the long trough of the Tyne Valley can be filled with fog but up here it can be clear enough to see the Cheviots or into Scotland.With March showers come days when rainbows arc above isolated Scots pine woodlands and the air vibrates to the wings of . There＊s the swooping lapwing, a high-up lark or the slow glide of curlew,  coming through the open window of my car. At  Lane I catch a white-barred flash from a wood pigeon, after which this little track is named.In May, there will be snow in summer as  flowers across the bogs. Come August, the honey-scented heather will turn the land purple. Colours and sights shift across the seasons, all seen from this one road. "																																																			
"Two members of the Climate Change Authority have resigned, with one accusing the government of being beholden to rightwing, anti-science ※extremists§ in its own party and in the media.John Quiggin told Guardian Australia he informed the federal minister for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, of his resignation on Thursday. It follows the resignation of fellow climate change authority member, Danny Price, who quit on Tuesday.※The government＊s refusal to accept the advice of its own authority, despite wide support for that advice from business, environmental groups and the community as a whole, reflects the comprehensive failure of its policies on energy and the environment,§ Quiggin said.※These failures can be traced, in large measure, to the fact that the government is beholden to rightwing anti-science activists in its own ranks and in the media. Rather than resist these extremists, the Turnbull government has chosen to treat the vital issues of climate change and energy security as an opportunity for political point-scoring and culture war rhetoric.§Quiggin said his immediate reason for resigning was the government＊s failure to respond to the authority＊s third report of the special review into potential climate policies, which the government had requested and which it was legally required to respond to.※The government has already indicated that it will reject the key recommendations of the review, particularly the introduction of an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity industry.§Quiggin said he didn＊t believe there was anything to be gained ※by giving objective advice based on science and economic analysis to a government dominated by elements hostile to both science and economics§. Price told Guardian Australia he had resigned because he ※didn＊t think it was appropriate for a member of a government agency to be openly critical of government policy§.※I think the authority does really good work, but I didn＊t think I could stay if I was going to continue to criticise the government＊s policy making and I didn＊t see any chance that it would get any better,§ he said.※I really hate the complete ad hocery of it all ＃ the idea that anything at all can be thrown out by a government in a political panic.§Quiggin was appointed to the authority in 2012, and Price in 2015. Both were appointed for five-year terms.The Climate Change Authority＊s special review was undertaken last year, and recommended the government institute two emissions trading schemes and strengthen regulations if it was to meet Australia＊s 2030 emission reduction targets. The report was criticised by the Climate Institute, the Greens, and other climate groups and experts criticised elements of the report, and in August , with three members writing a dissenting report.However many groups 每 including the Business Council of Australia, , retailer Energy Australia, , the Climate Change Authority, the  and the CSIRO 每 have also Frydenberg canvassed a trading scheme in December, but the  following objections from senior ministers. The government＊s openness to a scheme has also been  from the party in February.The Climate Change Authority was set up in 2011 as an independent statutory agency, and the Coalition has maintained that it should be abolished after failing to get its legislation to do just that through the Senate.Frydenberg told Guardian Australia: ※the government thanks both Danny Price and John Quiggin for their service and the government will continue to engage constructively with the authority§.The Greens climate and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the government＊s ※dangerous pandering to climate change deniers§ had left it friendless.※When added to previous resignations, this exodus is the equivalent of half the reserve bank board resigning over the government＊s economic policies.§"																																																			
"※Plausible§ possible sightings of a Tasmanian tiger in northern  have prompted scientists to undertake a search for the species thought to have died out more than 80 years ago.The last thylacine is thought to have died in Hobart zoo in 1936, and it is widely believed to have become extinct on mainland Australia at least 2,000 years ago.But sightings of large, dog-like animals that are neither dingoes nor foxes have persisted over the decades, despite widespread scepticism.Recent eyewitness accounts of potential thylacines in far north Queensland have spurred scientists from James Cook University to launch a search for the animal long considered extinct.Professor Bill Laurance said he had spoken at length to two people about animals they had seen in Cape York peninsula that could potentially be thylacines, and that they had given plausible and detailed descriptions.One was a long-time employee of the Queensland National Parks Service and the other was a frequent camper in the north of the state.Laurance said all the potential sightings to date had been at night. ※In one case four animals were observed at close range 每 about 20 feet away 每 with a spotlight.§Descriptions of their eyes, size, shape and behaviour were inconsistent with known attributes of other large species in north Queensland such as dingoes, wild dogs or feral pigs.The sightings were at two separate locations on Cape York peninsula, but the specifics were being kept confidential, said Laurance. ※Everything is being handled with strict confidence.§He said people who claimed to have seen a thylacine were ※very nervous about relating their tales for fear of being branded kooks or fringe types§.Richard Dawkins  of news of the study.※Can it be true? Has Thylacinus been seen alive? And in mainland Australia not ? I so want it to be true.§Sandra Abell, a researcher with James Cook University＊s Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science who was leading the field survey, said they had been contacted with more possible sightings since their intentions were publicised.She was in the process of deciding on sites for the more than 50 ※camera traps§ to be set up on Cape York peninsula, with the survey due to get under way when the dry season begins in April or May.Abell said even if a thylacine was not detected, the survey would inform the centre＊s understanding of the status of rare and endangered mammal species on the peninsula.Many mammals, including the northern bettong, were at risk from introduced predators, she said.※It is a low possibility that we＊ll find thylacines, but we＊ll certainly get lots of data on the predators in the area and that will help our studies in general.§It was ※not impossible§ there were thylacines to be found, she said. ※It＊s not a mythical creature. A lot of the descriptions people give, it＊s not a glimpse in the car headlights. People who say they＊ve actually seen them can describe them in great detail, so it＊s hard to say they＊ve seen anything else.※I＊m not ruling it out at all, but to actually get them on camera will be incredibly lucky.§Thylacine ※truthers§ active on Facebook were emboldened by the recent rediscovery of the night parrot in Western Australia, presumed extinct until 2013, and .※Maybe old stripey next?§ commented one member of ."																																																			
" laws protect people from discrimination based on factors such as race, disabilities and sexual orientation, and a Republican lawmaker wants to add a person＊s beliefs about climate change to that list.State representative Larry Lockman has introduced a bill that would limit the state attorney general＊s ability to investigate or prosecute people based on their political speech, including their views on climate change. It would also prohibit the state from making decisions on buying goods or services or awarding grants or contracts based on a person＊s ※climate change policy preferences§.Lockman, an independent business consultant from Amherst, told the Associated Press that he believed it was an open question whether human activity is the primary cause of climate change. Peer-reviewed studies, science organizations and climate scientists say that the world is warming from manmade forces.State representative Lois Galgay Reckitt, a Democrat of South Portland and a marine biologist who sits on the judiciary committee that has the bill, said prospects for passage are poor. She said she expected ※the entire Democratic caucus is going to hate it§, and some Republicans will, too. ※The issue for me is I＊m a scientist and I live near the ocean. It＊s absolutely clear to me that climate change is happening, and it worries me,§ she said. ※I will fight this tooth and nail.§ Lockman wants to prohibit the state attorney general from investigating, joining an investigation or prosecuting any person based on that person＊s protected political speech. But he said his bill would reaffirm free speech by protecting climate change supporters as well. ※I don＊t want to see a Republican state attorney general issuing subpoenas for the records of progressive or liberal thinktanks or public policy groups to chill their free speech,§ he said. The Democratic attorney general, Janet Mills, declined to comment. In his bill, Lockman says that the supreme court＊s decision in Citizens United ※continued the protection of protected political speech, no matter the source or message§. That case allowed corporations and unions to make unlimited independent expenditures in US elections. Jonathan Reisman, an associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of Maine at Machias and a vocal critic of the scientific consensus on climate change, said he requested the bill. He said the bill is an attempt to defend the first amendment freedom of those who speak out in a way that does not reflect the consensus. ※It＊s about Citizens United and the government abridging speech,§ he said. ※It＊s not about climate science. It＊s about climate policy.§ Lockman has a history of causing controversy. He once dressed as a vampire outside a federal building in Bangor to protest against the Internal Revenue Service. He also once accused liberals of assisting the Aids epidemic, saying they assured ※the public that the practice of sodomy is a legitimate alternative lifestyle, rather than a perverted and depraved crime against humanity§.He said he could not predict the outcome of his latest bill but expected a lot of interest at a public hearing scheduled for 6 April. Lockman＊s bill is ※absurd and unnecessary§, said Dylan Voorhees, climate and clean energy project director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine. ※Clearly an attempt to provide cover for climate deniers,§ he said. ※I see a trickle down from the Trump administration that has emboldened some folks to make climate denial statements.§ "

Invasive species are one of the prime contributors to , after habitat loss.But the language is problematic. ※Invasive§ suggests the species is to blame, when it is usually moved by globetrotting humans.

Killing destructive exotic species is not analogous to anti-migrant prejudice (although, intriguingly, history suggests that native species protections  in times of anxieties about human migration), because we are a single species.Globalisation is creating homogenised ecosystems.

"One sunny morning, Shi Dianshuo sets off for China＊s River of Happiness.※It＊s not very happy right now,§ the 24-year-old environmentalist admits as he drives north from Beijing to inspect the poetically named waterway.Driving 26 miles (42km) out of town, Shi＊s car pulls up beside a putrid, rubbish-strewn creek. A black sofa pokes up from its murky waters; a landfill decorates its western bank; and beside another heap of refuse, a stray bra hangs lazily from the branch of a tree, lending a comic touch to the bleak scene. ※I＊ve seen this kind of river so many times,§ complains Shi, pacing along the sewage-scented canal to evaluate the grime. ※It makes me feel bad. I＊m not happy about it.§Shi is one of hundreds of Chinese citizens fanning out across the country in search of what the government has labelled ※black and smelly rivers§.As part of the ※hei chou he§ (※black and smelly river§) initiative, China＊s environment ministry is asking members of the public to help it hunt down severely polluted waterways that can then be catalogued and, hopefully, cleaned up.Volunteers can post the locations and images of such waterways on a public  account operated by the ministry.Since the project started in February, citizens have used smartphones to identify and log more than 1,300 locations. They have been added to a pre-existing blacklist of more than 1,850 polluted waterways, says Shi, who works at the Beijing NGO Environmentalists in Action.Shi, who has so far denounced five such rivers, says he hopes his work puts pressure on authorities and draws attention to toxic waterways they do not know about. ※We think many black and smelly rivers have yet to be discovered,§ the activist says during a 6km trek along the River of Happiness or Xing Fu river. ※We want to get those ones on the list so they can deal with those rivers too.§Decades of unbridled industrialisation and urbanisation mean China has no shortage of .

"he federal government recently released the showcasing the numerous opportunities for businesses to be involved in conservation. This is great for the bush, but what aboutthe wildlife that calls the city home?With more than 80% of Australia＊s population living in cities, it might not feel like there＊s much room for nature. Yet scientists in the field of urban ecology and conservation, such as myself, aim to shine a light on our city-dwelling fauna, and develop new ways for people and wildlife to live side by side.A stroll through any Australian city proves there＊s no need to go bush to get in touch with native animals. From the brush turkeys of Brisbane to the powerful owls of Sydney, many species find ways to survive in the urban jungle. In fact, many of our rarest animals live in urban environments. Research under way at the  reveals that just over 100 of Australia＊s federally listedendangered animals live in cities or towns. For example, Canberra hosts the grassland earless dragon, striped legless lizard and painted honeyeater, while Melbourne is home to southern brown bandicoots, growling grass frogs and visiting swift parrots. Of the 70 species prioritised in the recent prospectus, around 25 have been recorded in or around urban areas.This means that not only are urban areas great places to engage with native wildlife but they can play an important role in the fight against the extinction of these species. And increasingly, scientists and conservationists are working with city planners,  and even  to develop  to sharing urban areas with wildlife.The first step is to realize that spaces for urban conservation don＊t have to be large. Even a solitary gum tree can be a lifeline for native wildlife. Researchers from the  found that large old trees are critical feeding and nesting sites for a huge range of animals in urban areas. Once lost, these trees take hundreds of years to replace, so it＊s vital to protect those that are left.Sydney＊s  are a great example of this. Sometimes large gum trees can drop branches, posing a safety risk to those using the space underneath. Instead of removing the whole tree, many councils now choose to prune the dangerous branches and retain the rest for wildlife. Artificial hollows can be cut in, and nesting boxes added to recreate nesting spaces for native birds and mammals. Creative solutions like this help to balance conservation goals with the local community concerns. Individuals can help wildlife by creating new habitats and resources in their local communities. When the natural nesting hollows formed in old trees are scarce, urban nest box programs are a salvation for , and  . The Hume city council is encouraging  to provide havens for native stingless bees, while Ku-ring-gai council has a  program, to help residents convert unused swimming pools into homes for native fish, frogs and turtles. Urban ponds and water sources provide much-needed water for other animals during droughts and heatwaves. Councils and business can also help by making the most of urban spaces for wildlife. Research shows that urban animals are resourceful, and often not too discerning. They can be found along roadsides, rubbish tips, abandoned lots and cemeteries, even nesting in skyscrapers. For example the  outside Melbourne is a hotspot for birdwatchers, who have recorded more than 270 species of native birds visiting the waters. Managing these spaces to protect species will be a big part of helping urban wildlife survive.The recent revolution in green roofs and green walls opens up even more avenues for wildlife in the city. They  and are becoming more common in buildings across the world. These features are not just fantastic for wildlife but serve as green oases for humans too, breathing new life into built environments. City living can be dangerous for wildlife; cars, windows, pets, powerlines and pesticides can take their toll. But new structures and innovations can help curb the carnage. Road-crossing structures such as wildlife bridges or underpasses are a good way to help animals cross roads safely. Crossings are built at sites where wildlife naturally try to cross the road, along with fences to help animals find the structure＊s entrance. Perhaps the most impressive structure in Australia is Brisbane＊s , which allows birds, mammals and reptiles to cross between two urban parklands without tangling with peak-hour traffic. Councils and road agencies are increasingly recognising the benefits of these structures, both for wildlife conservation and human safety. The actions we take to encourage wildlife into our towns have benefits for human residents. Increasing nature in cities is good for our own , can , and even .Urban conservation represents a great opportunity, both for people and native wildlife. Whether it＊s installing a nest box in a backyard, a bee hotel in a cafe garden, or a wildlife crossing on a local road, urban conservation empowers people to take positive action in their own homes, workplaces and communities. Taken individually, these actions may all seem small. But the combined effect can make a huge difference to the ability of native animals to survive in cities and towns."																																																			
"William Happer is a physicist at Princeton University 每 one of those US academic institutions with brand recognition for academic excellence that travels the globe. is well known for his contrarian views (that＊s the polite term) on human-caused climate change.So when it emerged last week that the professor might seriously be in the running to be President Donald Trump＊s science adviser, that Princeton tag no doubt added an air of authority to his opinions. In short, Happer thinks more CO2 will only be good for the planet 每 putting him .※There＊s a whole area of climate so-called science that is really more like a cult,§ Happer told the . ※It＊s like Hare Krishna or something like that. They＊re glassy-eyed and they chant. It will potentially harm the image of all science.§ Happer has also compared the ※demonisation§ of carbon dioxide to the ※demonisation of poor Jews under Hitler§ 每 because  will always .But here＊s the thing 〞 the first of many to note about Happer. First, he is not, by any stretch, an expert on climate change science.Happer＊s record of getting  in leading journals on climate change science is at, or very close to, zero. Simply, he knows a lot about some stuff, but he is not a climate scientist.While he has a distinguished career as an atomic physicist, previously serving the administration of George HW Bush as a science director, the 77-year-old＊s views on climate science are outnumbered by all the credible evidence, all the credible science agencies and are also being laughed at by the Earth＊s thermometers and its melting ice sheets and glaciers.Prof Michael Oppenheimer has scores of articles on climate science in leading journals going back to the mid-1990s. He＊s a climate scientist ＃ at Princeton.So what does Oppenheimer think of his colleague?※With respect to climate science and scientists,§ Oppenheimer told me by email, ※[Happer] is not only unknowledgeable but appears to have become unmoored.§Ouch. But then, maybe Oppenheimer has glassy eyes? Happer has laid out his thoughts on climate change in some detail in an ongoing  (my irony meter just exploded) with the Australian climate scientist Prof David Karoly.While Happer＊s contribution seems technical, it＊s the same parade  that actual climate scientists have been dealing with for years. Happer says CO2 levels and temperatures have been much higher in the past and that life ※flourished§ under these conditions many millions of years ago. He doesn＊t mention that during those times sea levels were probably several metres 每 sometimes well over 10 metres 每 higher than they are today. If that＊s the world you want to advocate, then it＊s time to call the removal guys for most of the world＊s major coastal cities. The climate scientist Dr Nerilie Abram, of Australian National University, specialises in the climate of the ancient past. She told me: Happer also rolls out that mouldy old chestnut that CO2 is just food for plants, but ignores the research on the impacts that higher concentrations of CO2 will have on our global food supply. Research into some staple crops such as rice, wheat and sorghum, for example, finds that they . That＊s before you worry about how food crops will cope with droughts and heatwaves. At a conference in December Happer said his ※main concern§ was that climate change was ※likely to damage public perceptions of science§. If Happer is concerned about the reputation of science, then he＊s picking some very odd places to hang around 每 that conference being one of them.The  was organised by Freedom Force International 每 a group led by the famed conspiracy theorist G Edward Griffin. He fits right in with the  that＊s growing big audiences online.Among many other things, Griffin has § as HIV and that human-caused climate change is a hoax. Griffin also promotes conspiracies around ※chemtrails§. Just punch that word into your favourite search engine for hours of family fun (don＊t actually do that). To summarise, there＊s a plan to spray the atmosphere with chemicals added to planes to poison everyone and ※they§ are using weather modification as a weapon.Griffin  ※somebody is spending a lot of money and effort to spray the planet§ and that this is probably some international effort.Also appearing at the conference was the British hereditary peer and climate science denier Lord Christopher Monckton, who likes to say he was  report without mentioning that, literally, you need no qualifications and can ※appoint§ yourself.Happer＊s speech to the conference isn＊t yet online but an interview he gave at the venue after is. He goes over the same ground.

"ormer London mayor Boris Johnson has been  of holding back negative findings from a 2013 report on the city＊s air pollution.The  stated that 433 of London＊s 1,777 primary schools were in areas where nitrogen dioxide concentrations breached EU limits. Nitrogen dioxide, or NO, is an air pollutant that when inhaled can aggravate respiratory diseases such as asthma, emphysema and bronchitis. It has been estimated that in 2010 there were  in London associated with long term exposure to NO.There＊s a social element too. Of those 433 polluted schools, 82% were officially considered ※deprived§ (where more than 40% of pupils eligible for free school meals).Given that the then-mayor was, for some time, promoting  it is difficult to understand . After all, the finding that children, especially poorer children, suffer the most from air pollution isn＊t particularly surprising.In November 2015 a study by King＊s College London and the thinktank Policy Exchange found that a third of the capital＊s primary, secondary and independent schools were situated in areas with NO concentrations above legal limits. This equates to about  in London being exposed to poor air quality.This isn＊t just a London thing: the Sunday Times mapped school location against government data of NO emissions per square kilometre and found that about 3,000 British schools were sited in areas with potentially .Two schools in South Yorkshire next to the M1, England＊s main north-south motorway, are to be  as their pupils were .However in Croydon, south London, a new school is to be built next to a busy arterial road where NO concentrations have been shown to . It is proposed that the school will be ※internally ventilated§ to reduce the pupil＊s exposure.The London report highlights the importance of environmental justice: deprived poorer communities suffer from poor air quality more than wealthy communities and by implication its associated disease burden. This has been known for some time and data from 2001 indicates that of the 2.5 million people in areas of Britain where the NO limit value was breached, more than half were among  of the population. A more recent analysis found that air quality improvement has been greatest in the .There is now a wealth of research papers that have characterised children＊s exposure to air pollutants in schools, although many concentrate on . In one of the most comprehensive studies, focused on , it was found that schools had high levels of pollutants because the majority of them were very close to high traffic streets. However schools contribute to  of a child＊s total exposure to air pollution.Why is exposure to air pollution of particular concern for children? Young people are more susceptible to air pollution as their lungs are still growing and developing, and because they tend to spend more time being active outdoors. For example children living in areas with high levels of nitrogen dioxide have up to 10% less lung capacity) than normal.Both the  and parliament＊s  have noted that little attention has been paid to planning when it comes to air pollution at schools due to their proximity to roads. The committee even recommended that national planning policy ※should make it impossible to build new schools, care homes or health clinics near existing air pollution hotspots, and any redevelopment of such existing buildings should only be approved if they reduce pollution exposure for their users. Building regulations should provide for existing schools sited near pollution hotspots to be fitted with air filtration systems.§Transport to and from school is one option that should be considered. However, parents are often reluctant to allow their child to walk along busy roads and so often drive, making the situation worse. Children these days are  less often. In the 1970s an estimated 64% of all trips to school were made by walking (74% for primary age pupils and 53% for secondary age). By 2014 younger children were being driven as often as they walked in (both 46%) while older children were walking just 38% of the time.Exploring safer or  routes could be one solution to encourage more walking to school and reduce exposure to air pollution.Every council has a legal duty to increase opportunities for children to travel to and from school by sustainable modes such as cycling and . Most schools have a ※§ which identifies healthy and sustainable transport options to help to reduce the numbers of cars on the road at peak times and improve the local environment.

"The 2016 Australian election is the last opportunity to save the , the authors of a new scientific paper have warned.The government needs to commit to $1bn a year for 10 years to reduce water pollution, which would give the reef a chance to survive the impacts of climate change,※This is the last chance,§ said the lead author, Jon Brodie from James Cook University. ※The current spending is totally inadequate ... You either do it properly or you give up on the reef. It＊s that bad.§, with warm water causing . It is the worst bleaching event ever seen in the Great Barrier Reef. Mass bleaching events were never seen before 1998.The reef＊s ability to recover from bleaching is hampered by water pollution, caused largely by nearby land-clearing, as well as fertiliser and pesticide run-off from farming. Fishing also damages the reef＊s resilience by disrupting the ecosystems that support healthy coral.Brodie and his colleague Richard Pearson analysed all the , evaluated their impacts and developed an estimate of what would be needed to give the reef a fighting chance against already locked-in climate change. The required measures would cost $10bn over 10 years. Brodie said that would get water quality to a point where the reef was in the best shape possible to fight the impact of climate change.※It＊s a lot of money but the alternative is just to give up on the reef,§ Brodie said. ※We know how to do it. In fact right now we＊re spending a little bit of money doing some of it and we have made a little bit of progress with that little bit of money but we just need a lot more.§Several water quality improvement plans have been created over the past couple of years. They involve input from agricultural scientists, reef ecologists, economists and social scientists. Using those, Brodie was able to develop a plan.The analysis recommended management of the reef be extended from the world heritage area to include the ※greater Great Barrier Reef§. That would extend from the Torres Strait in the north to Hervey Bay in the south and include the catchment areas that are directly responsible for the water pollution.It also found a focus should be diverted from the struggling reefs to the ecosystems that are still in relatively good condition, including those in the Torres Strait, northern Cape York and Hervey Bay.Stronger regulation was also needed, with powers available under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act being used to stop activities on land that are polluting the water. Some of the required measures could be controversial, including buybacks of some sugarcane farms that are too polluting. But Brodie said many of those farms were not particularly profitable and many farmers would be happy to sell the land.The $10bn needed by 2025 amounted to $1bn a year. But since the reef was  for the Australian economy, that amounted to just 5% of its economic value for a limited time.Brodie said this federal election was the last chance for the reef. If this plan or one like it wasn＊t committed to, he said it could be time to give up on the reef. ※It takes time for change to happen and we need to start fast,§ he said. Imogen Zethoven from the Australian Marine Conservation Society said: ※Things are worse than we thought for the reef＊s future; we are close to the brink of what this fragile ecosystem can tolerate without a credible plan for restoring it to good health.※This federal election is an historic opportunity for political leaders to take heed and act decisively to stop its destruction,§ she said."

For more than half a century I＊ve made regular pilgrimages to this pool, the southern Welsh uplands wrapped round it like a protective barrier. The view takes in the Black Mountains to the south, the Brecon Beacons in the west, and those smooth, heathery highlands of Radnorshire to the north.There＊s a stand of drowned Scots pine at the pool＊s western end.

"The extraordinary ability of eager beavers to engineer degraded land into wildlife-rich wetlands has been revealed by a new study in Scotland.Scientists studied the work of a group of four re-introduced beavers over a decade and found their water engineering prowess created almost 200m of dams, 500m of canals and an acre of ponds. The result was a landscape ※almost unrecognisable§ from the original pasture that was drained over 200 years ago, with the number of plant species up by nearly 50% and richly varied habitats established across the 30 acre site.Beavers were hunted to extinction in the UK in the 17th century, but a few hundred now live in Scotland, where they are now . Interest is growing rapidly in controlled releases in the rest of the UK, where only a few dozen live, with a  being monitored closely and an  being considered.The researchers say their new work provides solid evidence that beavers can be a low-cost option in restoring wetlands, an important and biodiverse habitat that has lost two-thirds of its worldwide extent since 1900. ※Wetlands also serve to store water and improve its quality 每 they are the ＆kidneys of the landscape＊,§ said Professor Nigel Willby, at Stirling University and one of the study team. by the team showed how beaver dams can slow water flows, reducing downstream flood risk and water pollution.Beavers build their elaborate waterworks to create pools in which they can shelter from their traditional predators, bears, wolves and wolverines. The new research, , regularly surveyed the site near Blairgowrie in Tayside where two beavers were released in 2002 and began to breed in 2006. Beavers live 10-15 years in the wild and the average number of beavers present during the study was four.※After 12 years of habitat engineering by beaver, the study site was almost unrecognisable from its initial state,§ the scientists concluded: ※The reintroduction of such species may yet prove to be the missing ingredient in successful and sustainable long-term restoration of wetland landscapes.§Alan Law, another member of the team from Stirling University, said: ※We know lots about the benefits of beavers in natural settings, but until now we did not know the full extent of what they can achieve in present-day landscapes where restoration is most needed.§He said wetland restoration usually involves ditch blocking and mowing or grazing to maintain diversity: ※Beavers offer an innovative, more hands-off, solution to the problem of wetland loss. Seeing what beavers can do for our wetlands and countryside highlights the diverse landscape we have been missing for the last 400 years.§However the scientists said beaver reintroductions had to be carefully managed to deal with the potential impacts on farmers, who fear crops being raided by beavers and damage to embankments that protect low-lying fields and other areas from floods.※Any species introduction, particularly if it has not been in this country for hundreds of years, can have a massive impact on the many benefits that the countryside delivers,§ said Mark Pope, chair of the National Farmers Union＊s environment forum. ※The impact of beavers is assessed across the whole landscape considering the impacts on all land uses. This study is just one piece of that big jigsaw. We need to learn from Scotland＊s experiences before any decisions are taken on the future status of beavers.§Anglers are also concerned about the impact of beaver dams on salmon and other fish, fearing they might block migration upstream. But Wilby said: ※The main conclusions from recent studies were that the overall effect of beavers was positive.§ This is because greater biodiversity provides more food for the fish and the deeper pools maintain stable cool water temperatures, even as the climate warms. ※I think as long as beavers have plenty of space to form a decent number of territories, there are enormous potential benefits,§ said Wliby. ※Sometimes the negative views of farmers can dominate.§"																																																			
"Fish and chip lovers can now enjoy North Sea cod with a clear conscience, after the fishery was awarded sustainable status by the  on Wednesday.Stocks of cod in the North Sea were once one of the world＊s great fisheries but plummeted by 84% between the early 1970s and 2006. They came perilously close to the total collapse seen in the  off Canada in the early 1990s, which has still not recovered.But action to decommission fishing boats, ban catches in nursery areas and put larger holes in nets to allow young cod to escape has seen the stock rise fourfold since 2006. The MSC, a non-profit certification group, undertook a detailed 18-month study and has now approved the North Sea cod catch of 228 boats in Scotland and England, which represents the vast majority of the white fish fleet.Sustainable North Sea cod will carry the MSC＊s blue label and is expected in supermarkets as early as next week, with Waitrose likely to be among the first to offer the fish. North Sea cod has never been approved by the MSC in the group＊s 20-year history and the MSC certification also requires fishers to protect cold water corals from damage by trawlers.Currently, about 90% of cod in the UK is imported, mostly from Iceland and from Norwegian and Russian boats fishing in the Barents Sea, which have all gained MSC sustainability certification in recent years.But now cod caught and landed in the UK will also be labelled sustainable. UK citizens eat about 70,000 tonnes of cod a year 每 1kg per person 每 and the proportion of UK cod consumed is now expected to rise. Industry group Seafish estimated there are over 10,000 takeaway fish and chip shops in the UK, serving about 380m meals a year.The UK fleet has been given a five-year approval from the MSC, subject to annual checks. The fleet will also have to adapt to new EU rules banning the discarding of bycatch 每 dead fish for which the fishermen have no landing quota 每 and the change of management regime after the UK leaves the EU.The future of fisheries management has been a high profile part of the Brexit debate, with many fishermen arguing that taking control of UK waters would mean more fish for UK boats and better management. However, conservation groups have warned against diluting environmental protection and recent improvements to the common fisheries policy.James Simpson, from the MSC, said the North Sea cod stocks have just recently reached a sustainable level. ※You can literally keep on fishing forever,§ he said, if the protections against overfishing are maintained. This sustainable stock level is about 40% of the total estimated to once have been present.Fisheries minister George Eustice said: ※The UK has played a leading role in the recovery of North Sea cod stocks and it＊s great news that this iconic species has been certified and recognised as sustainable seafood. As we prepare to leave the EU we have an opportunity to improve how we manage fish stocks in our waters.§The action that brought North Sea cod back from the brink hit fishing communities hard, with many boats taken out of service and fishing days limited. Mike Park, chair of the Scottish Fisheries Sustainable Accreditation Group, said: ※This [new accreditation] is a massive development for the catching sector and is a testament to the power of collective action. The years of commitment to rebuilding North Sea cod has shown that fishermen are responsible and can be trusted to deliver stable and sustainable stocks.§Lyndsey Dodds, head of UK marine policy at WWF, agreed that the improvement in cod stock showed what was possible when the fishing industry, managers and scientists worked together. But she said: ※The amount of North Sea cod at breeding age is well below late 1960s levels and recovery remains fragile. If we＊re to get North Sea cod back on British plates for good, it＊s vital that we don＊t lose focus on sustainably managing fish stocks and protecting the marine wildlife as the UK develops its post-Brexit fisheries policy.§The MSC hope their new accreditation for North Sea cod will help end the confusion some UK shoppers felt about the sustainability of cod. A 2015 survey found 28% of people thought cod was not sustainable and should not be eaten, while an equal proportion though the opposite.Another sustainability scheme run by the Marine Conservation Society currently rates North Sea cod as not sustainable, but this rating is currently under review and could be changed within a month or two.

"fter explaining to a visitor the lengths to which I go to encourage  and  on my fen, I was amused to hear her describe the troubles she takes to keep them from her garden. I know they＊re prickly customers, but why do people dislike them?What I cherish most is the sheer architectural grandeur of the summer plant. Each fully open flowerhead has a kind of declarative beauty 每 a blend of spine-fringed awkwardness and inner sensuous velvet. No wonder nations have hitched their wagons to the thistle＊s star-like bloom. Even in autumn, when they are desiccated and devoid of seed floss, and possibly enwrapped in old spider＊s web, they retain an aura of dignity. Yet my real awakening to their virtues was thanks to the bumblebees. I love these insects, and they, in turn, adore feeding on thistle blossom. There are few more impressive summer sights in our area than a marsh-thistle bed in a late-June blow. Scores of the magenta-topped spikes bend back and forth in the breeze like some kinetic sculpture. Regardless of this fair-ride movement, the bees cling to those bulbous heads or dance from one swaying wand to another.My favourite recent visitor to Blackwater＊s thistles is a . It gathers the pollen, not in a sac on the hind leg as in bumblebees or honeybees, but on specialised hairs across the whole underside of its abdomen.  bees can swim sometimes for minutes on end through those plush beds in a big spear-thistle head. They also use their legs to press the pollen from the scores of individual florets until they utterly smothered in the stuff. To watch them about this business, truffling head-first in the plants＊ sexual parts, one senses that there is an almost ritualised, erotic pattern to the movements. It is as if the insect realises that it＊s an agent in the thistles＊ reproduction.There is mutual profit in the process, because more pollinated flowers means more plants next year 每 and more thistles means more bees. At Blackwater this insect is truly propagator-in-chief in its own garden."																																																			
"ostojna Cave in  is one of Europe＊s longest cave networks and one of the world＊s most spectacular subterranean tourist sites. Hundreds of thousands of visitors come here every year to gaze at its wonders: its huge stalactites and stalagmites, its curtains of coloured rock and bridges that have been carved out of the local limestone by the river Pivka over millions of years.Given such glories, it is not surprising that few tourists take note of the two concrete huts draped with black polythene that have been erected in a shadowy alcove in one obscure part of the 24km-long labyrinth. But the huts contain wonders of their own. In racks of trays of water, scientists have placed specimens of one of the world＊s strangest creatures: the blind aquatic salamander or olm, as it is known locally. It constitutes a project that could have profound implications for the future of these remarkable creatures.※We now have 21 baby olms flourishing in our trays,§ said Primoz Gnezda, a biologist working in Postojna Cave. ※For the first time we have witnessed the hatching of proteus larvae 每 and, after one year, they are all healthy. And that gives us hope we can save our olms for the future.§Olms spend their lives in total darkness in the Postojna cavern complex. They can grow to up to a foot in length, making them the world＊s largest cave-dwelling animals and they can live up to a century, though they usually breed only once every six or seven years. The creatures can detect the bioelectric fields of other organisms 每 helping them hunt in the dark for their main prey, the cave shrimp. And experiments have suggested that they use the Earth＊s magnetic field to orient themselves. In addition, they possess photosensitive skin: if you shine a torch on the tail of an olm, it will swim away from you.That extraordinary set of attributes has brought olms considerable renown among animal lovers, not least David Attenborough who has included them in his list of endangered animals he would most like to save from extinction. They are, he says, ※one of the ultimate specialists§ in the natural world. They have adapted to living in total darkness by losing their sight and can survive for up to 10 years without food. ※The olm lives life in the slow lane which seems to be its secret for living a long life＃ and perhaps that is a lesson for us all,§ says Attenborough.Given their remote, stygian home, it might be expected that olms would be relatively new to the world of science but their existence has been known about for centuries. That＊s because their habitat 每 the subterranean pools and rivers of the great karst outcrops of Slovenia and the north Adriatic coast 每 occasionally becomes flooded during rainstorms and when that happens the olms get flushed out into the open. In medieval times, the appearance of these writhing, white, eyeless creatures in the midst of severe storms caused some alarm. Locals believed they were the spawn of a mythical beast, most likely a dragon. So they become known as baby dragons 每 and the name has stuck, not least on the mugs and fridge magnets on sale in the tourist shops. In fact, with their clammy white skin and tiny legs, olms look more like miniature versions of Gollum than baby Smaug.Slovenia is extremely proud of its remarkable little blind salamander which featured on the country＊s pre-Euro coins. But the creature faces problems. For a start there is the threat of pollution to its waters from surrounding factories and towns - many of which are outside Slovenia. It has also suffered from the attentions of collectors. As a result  is now rated as vulnerable by the International Union for Nature Conservancy.That explains the particular joy that met the news that young baby dragons had been bred and were now being carefully nurtured in that dark subterranean hut. It was the first time olms had been persuaded to breed in a scientifically controlled environment within Postojna Cave. ※In the cave, in nature, olms hatch all the time,§ said Saso Weldt, another cave biologist, ※but nobody has ever seen that happen or seen a hatchling younger than about two years 每 until now.§The discovery that a mother olm had started to lay eggs was made in January last year by cave guide Juan Pablo Maschio. He reported having seen one attached to the wall of the aquarium in the cave that allows tourists to see living examples of Postojna＊s distinctive salamanders. Biologists who rushed to the tank found the mother fighting to fend off other olms. Three years earlier, in 2013, another captive olm had laid eggs but none hatched and many were eaten by the other olms in her tank. This time the Postojna team were able to move the other olms out of the tank and allow their ※dragon mum§ to go on to lay her eggs. On 30 May, four months after the first egg was laid, the first baby dragon was born. In the end, a total of 21 larvae were hatched. ※It was just fantastic. We all had tears in our eyes,§ said Katja Dolenc Batagelj, head of the Postojna Cave laboratory.At present, all 21 baby dragons are thriving and have grown from 2 to 7cm over the past year, and studies of the creatures continue. Last year, Lilijana Mali, of the University of Ljubljana 每 working with Stanley Sessions of Hartwick College, New York, and others 每  have evolved a unique genetic feature in which a piece of Y-chromosome (in most creatures present only in males) has become attached to an X-chromosome. Such a translocation can mix up sex determination and cause gender ambiguity, even in humans. This translocation may have arisen to conserve genes that are useful in the olms＊ lightless, low-food environments. However, it may also pose reproductive problems for the species.※The establishment of our breeding colony in Postojna gives us a chance to carry out more research and see what has been the impact on the genes of  in evolving in this strange environment,§ says Mali.The story underlines the importance of the Postojna team＊s success in establishing a breeding colony. ※There may be thousands of our baby dragons in the caves but equally there is a constant danger of pollution,§ says Batagelj. ※Only a slight change to the water here might have a devastating effect so this colony is a lifeline.§"																																																			
" has welcomed the plan to make electric or zero-emission cars and vans account for all new sales from 2040, but said the government and industry now faced big decisions on how the extra power was provided and demand for it was managed.The grid recently  of additional capacity, on top of the current peak demand of 60GW.By comparison, the nuclear power station being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset will add 3.2GW of capacity to the system.By the middle of the century, when it is assumed almost all cars will be electric, that extra peak demand could be up to 18GW.The lowest estimates of extra demand assume that drivers charge their cars at off-peak times. Smart meters and time-of-day tariffs could incentivise owners to charge when wind and solar power are plentiful and electricity is cheaper.Energy networks could also manage demand via automatic time-shift charging, whereby a car plugged in at home at 6pm is not actually charged until the early hours of the morning, when demand is low. to think carefully and avoid placing extra pressure on the grid.James Court, head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, a trade group, said: ※We need smart vehicle charging and price-reflective tariffs if the future electric fleet is to be a huge benefit and not a hindrance to our grid.§Regardless of how sensibly the extra demand is spread across the day, electric cars will require investment in new power generation.The energy analyst Wood Mackenzie estimates that if one in three cars sold in 2035 is fully electric, the vehicles would collectively account for 3% of the UK＊s total electricity demand. Building 400,000 charging points for them all would cost ?30bn, the group has said.National Grid said the extra power would be generated from gas, windfarms, imports and nuclear reactors 每 not from coal, which is scheduled to .And the switch to electric vehicles could even provide an eventual boost to the grid.

" The government＊s new clean air plan has been branded inadequate by the leaders of eight heavily polluted cities, as campaigners said banning petrol and diesel cars from 2040 would not help the thousands dying each year from illnesses linked to toxic fumes.The long-awaited report was published by , the environment secretary, on Wednesday, after a court ruled last year that the government must improve its proposals for tackling illegal levels of pollution.It confirmed conventional petrol and diesel cars would be banned in 23 years but the government refused to legislate for more ※clean air zones§ that would charge the dirtiest vehicles to enter some of the UK＊s most polluted cities.The plan also stopped short of bringing in a scrappage scheme to encourage people to give up diesel cars, considering only a ※targeted§ version to incentivise some some groups of people on low incomes or in particularly polluted areas.In a letter to Gove, the leaders of Liverpool, Leeds, Birmingham, Southampton, Leicester and Oxford city councils called for urgent legislation and a proper diesel scrappage scheme, saying the long-awaited air quality plan would not enable them to keep to their legal limits on pollution.The city leaders said the ※updated clean air plan, while indicating long-term ambition, still lacks some specific actions that would enable us to meet the legal limits and establish safer air sooner rather than later§.The criticism means the government could face further legal action to force it to produce a more comprehensive plan, with environmentalists, doctors and opposition politicians arguing it is insufficient to deal with a ※health emergency§ estimated to be killing 40,000 people a year.Some energy experts also warned that a wholesale switch fromconventional to electric cars could put the National Grid under huge pressure and require many new power stations.ClientEarth, the environmental lawyers that previously took the government to court, said it appeared to be ※little more than a shabby rewrite of the previous draft plans and is underwhelming and lacking in urgency§.※The court ordered action by the UK to obey its own laws as soon as possible. This plan kicks the can down the road yet again,§ said James Thornton, chief executive of the firm. ※The 2040 diesel and petrol ban, while important is a diversionary tactic and doesn＊t deal with the public health emergency caused by illegally polluted air, now.§Ministers had been urged to introduce charges for vehicles to enter a series of clean air zones (CAZs) in new cities, adding to existing plans for such measures in Birmingham, Derby, Leeds, Nottingham, Southampton, and London.But the government said it only wants new charging zones to be considered as a last resort, despite  showing that such clean air zones are the ※quickest, most cost-effective way§ to tackle the problem.It named 80 A-roads and motorways with particularly poor air quality but said councils should exhaust other options before opting to impose charging, and restrictions should be time-limited and lifted as soon as pollution is within legal limits.Instead, most councils will be given money from a ?250m pot to tackle pollution hotspots with ※surgical interventions§ such as improving public transport and changing road layouts. Labour said the government was ※shunting the problem on to local authorities§, which have 18 months to submit their plans for action.In their letter to Gove, six councils warned that some of these suggestions for surgical interventions risk ※displacing the problem elsewhere in our cities rather than solving it .... and they could also increase traffic and congestion§.※Only national backing of local action, in law and in resources, will enable us to tackle this crisis effectively,§ they said.Another council, Sheffield, called the report ※woefully inadequate§, with Jack Scott, cabinet member for transport, saying he was ※highly sceptical that the government＊s announcement today even meets their legal duties on air quality§.Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, also joined in the criticism saying the ban on petrol and diesel cars from 2040 was a ※half-hearted commitment§ that Londoners cannot afford to wait for.This was echoed by Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader and energy secretary, who said he feared the new ban in 23 years＊ time was a ※smokescreen for weak measures to tackle 40,000 deaths a year from air pollution now§.Gove had also been pressed to bring in a scrappage scheme for diesel cars, but the final document only said the government would consider a limited programme to incentivise drivers to switch the most polluting cars for cleaner vehicles.This would be directed at those who most need support, such as those on lower incomes or those living in the immediate vicinity of a clean air zone. It sounded a negative tone about the idea, saying previous schemes have been ※poor value for the taxpayer and open to a degree of fraud§.The report＊s flagship measure was a pledge to ban new sales of conventional diesel and petrol cars by 2040, but this did not go as far as expected because hybrid car sales would still be allowed. Previously, the government had said 2050 emissions targets required ※almost all new cars and vans sold to be near-zero emission at the tailpipe by 2040§.Senior doctors specialising in child health expressed dismay at the failure to take more decisive action. Prof Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said there was ※indisputable evidence demonstrating the tragic effects it has on the development of the lungs and hearts of children§. ※Having been told [by the courts] to go back to the drawing board so many times, that the government＊s final air quality plan still lacks sufficiently strong measures to clean our air is frankly inexcusable,§ she said.Prof Jonathan Grigg, from Barts and the London school of medicine and dentistry, also said more urgent action was needed※The 2040 target means that several generations of children will suffer the long term consequences of inhaling sooty particles and oxides of nitrogen,§ he said. ※The government needs to act now, with a faster and more robust response to this public health emergency.§Industry figures criticised the lack of detail and Mike Cherry, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said it ※still leaves many small businesses in the dark, particularly regarding any potential diesel scrappage scheme§.Others were concerned about jobs when conventional cars are phased out. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of Unite, said nothing should be done to jeopardise the ※hard won§ success of the car industry, adding: ※The announcement has wide-ranging implications for the UK economy and future employment prospects of hundreds of thousands of skilled workers. We are calling for a national debate embracing employers, unions and ministers.§Mike Hawes, the boss of car industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said it was crucial that the government supported the development of electric car technologies and attracted the major battery manufacturers to the UK to prevent the industry, which supports 814,000 jobs, from being damaged. Environmental groups also reacted with disappointment. , the green charity, said it was a cynical move for the government to grab headlines with the eyecatching promise to ban new diesel cars in future, when there is little in the plan to deal with immediate problems.The plan was described as gimmicky by Areeba Hamid, a clean air campaigner at  UK. ※While this plan makes the right headline-grabbing noises, in reality it means that children across the UK will continue to be exposed to harmful air pollution for years to come, with potentially irreversible impacts,§ she said. ※The government cannot shy away any longer from the issue of diesel cars clogging up and polluting our cities, and must now provide real solutions, not just gimmicks.§Opposition parties criticised the plan for failing to go far enough and highlighted the weakness of proposals to deal with air quality in the short and medium term.Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, said there had already been ※seven years of illegal air pollution under this Conservative government, who have only acted after being dragged through the courts§.※Despite the scale of the problem of illegal air pollution, we are presented today with further consultations and delays, a squeamish attitude to clean air zones, shunting the problem on to local authorities and no detail about how the government＊s 2040 target will be achieved,§ she said. ※With nearly 40 million people living in areas with illegal levels of air pollution, action is needed now, not in 23 years＊ time.§The plan was defended by Gove, who said it ※sets out how we will work with local authorities to tackle the effects of roadside pollution caused by dirty diesels, in particular nitrogen dioxide§. ※This is one element of the government＊s ?3bn programme to clean up the air and reduce vehicle emissions,§ he said."																																																			
"Hundreds of thousands of taxpayers＊ pounds have been spent on equipping badger cull marksmen with radios that link them directly to police, the Guardian has learned. have advised the government to invest in the same communications system they use to make it easier for officers to get to conflicts with cull saboteurs in remote areas where the mobile phone signal is poor. However, anti-cull activists plan to turn the tables on the marksmen by investing in devices that trace the signals produced by the radios, meaning they can pinpoint their position and disrupt shooting.  Another hi-tech tactic protesters are planning to use is deploying infra-red night vision on drones to hunt for marksmen and badgers caught in traps.  The government is expected to announce imminently that the cull will be expanded into new areas this autumn.  This year, protesters believe the cull will extend east to Wiltshire and north to Cheshire and .  Since the cull began, there has been tension between police and protesters over whether officers help keep shooters a step ahead of activists.have revealed that in 2016 and this year the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) paid almost ?500,000 to  Defra confirmed the equipment was provided to those taking part in cull operations. A spokesperson said: ※We take the safety of the public and those undertaking badger control operations very seriously. That is why, on the advice of local police forces, radio equipment has been hired by Defra for licence holders to provide a reliable means of communication should any incident arise.§Airwave equipment is considered by police to be the most effective network because mobile reception can be unreliable in the sort of remote areas where much of the culling takes place. Jay Tiernan, of Stop the Cull, whose members take direct action against the cull, said it would invest in detectors that pick up Airwave signals. This would allow protesters to pinpoint marksmen and disrupt them.  Tiernan said: ※Shooters will face a choice between being cut off completely from police backup, or only having backup at the cost of being quickly located by antis. The irony that it is the very equipment purchased to protect them being their weakest security point, hasn＊t been lost on saboteurs keen to get out there with these devices.  ※It＊s going to lead to many late night chases across cull zones and safety will be a major issue now that police forces are so badly stretched in many areas.§In another development, Natural England, the government＊s conservation watchdog, has blocked the release of . Evidence from previous culls has shown that fox populations increase when badgers are culled, which could reduce the numbers of rare ground-nesting birds.  After a three-year battle, the Information Commissioner＊s Office last month ordered Natural England to provide the analysis, but the conservation body has appealed against the ruling, preventing the information from being made public before the new round of culling. Natural England claims the data will enable activists to better identify the cull zones and potentially harass the marksmen and farmers conducting the cull."																																																			
"Britain＊s car industry has warned that the government＊s proposed ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 risks damaging the industry and stalling sales of new cars.Mike Hawes, chief of executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders trade body, said that carmakers were working with ministers on the switch to electric cars but called for the government to use carrots rather than sticks.※Outright bans risk undermining the current market for new cars and our sector, which supports over 800,000 jobs across the UK, so the industry instead wants a positive approach, which gives consumers incentives to purchase these cars. ※We could undermine the UK＊s successful automotive sector if we don＊t allow enough time for the industry to adjust,§ he said.However, experts said two decades was plenty of time for carmakers to evolve away from the internal combustion engine.Prof David Bailey, an automotive industry expert at Aston University, said: ※I think that＊s more than enough time. It＊s sufficiently long to be taken seriously and give the industry time to adjust.§He said that by 2040 carmakers would have switched over to battery-powered vehicles regardless of the government＊s announcement. But in the short term, he said ministers needed to do more to ease that switch.※I think where they [carmakers] probably have a point is the government isn＊t doing enough to incentivise people to switch over to electric cars and hybrids in the short term,§ said Bailey.Motorists are offered a ?4,500 government grant off the price of fully electric cars (down from ) and ?2,500 for plug-in hybrids, which can run a short distance on a battery before switching to a conventional engine. Bailey said the scheme should stay until the 2020s. Research by  suggests that will be the decade when there is a tipping point as the total cost of owning an electric car 每 including refuelling and maintenance, as well as buying the vehicle 每 becomes cheaper than combustion engine vehicles without subsidies.BMW, which on Tuesday , said it was on track to sell 100,000 fully and partially electric vehicles around the world this year, up from 62,000 in 2016. ※We see electric powertrains as the future for our industry,§ a spokesman said. Nissan said it welcomed the move by ministers.However, one luxury carmaker branded the government＊s plans ※absurd§ because some drivers need to travel long distances. The average range of a new electric car is 100-150 miles, although some of  can now run for more than 300 miles between charges.Andy Palmer, chief executive of Aston Martin, : ※If the government is going to legislate then they have to assist as well, otherwise they will destroy part of the industry.§Andy Barratt, managing director of Ford of Britain, told the Guardian: ※Our product plans very much support that kind of timeline. A 23-year period is a good notice period.§ But he said despite the UK and France announcing a phase-out of new petrol and diesels by 2040, there was ※not a global movement at this point in time§ to ban them.The British car industry said it could only hit the 2040 deadline if consumers wanted electric cars. ※[Demand is] still at a very low level as consumers have concerns over affordability, range and charging points,§ said Hawes.According to a survey of 2,134 drivers, only 2% of people are thinking of buying a pure electric model as their next car. The main reason given for not considering one was cost, followed by concerns over range and the time needed for recharging. The survey, for insurance firm Aviva, also showed that, after VW＊s emission scandal and amid concerns over pollution, drivers are turning away from diesel: 68% said their next car would be petrol, with only 21% choosing diesel. New car sales are currently split roughly half and half between petrol and diesel.This year so far, fully electric cars accounted for 0.5% of all new registrations, plug-in hybrids accounted for 1% and hybrids, such as the Toyota Prius, 2.6%. While only 37,000 of the 26m cars on British roads now are pure electric, they are growing at an astonishing rate: .Some carmakers will do better than others out of the transition the government wants. Bailey said that Renault-Nissan, BMW and Volvo, , had already gone a ※long way§ towards a battery-powered future. Ford, by comparison, had been ※very slow§, he said.Ultimately, it was too early to say who would win out, he said. ※Who survives and who prospers? We just don＊t know at this point.§Ben Lane, director of the site Next Green Car, said VW was also emerging as a leader on electric cars as a result of the emissions scandal over its diesel models. ※At the bottom of the list is Ford. They do have conventional hybrids in US, they do have the Focus electric, but they＊ve not pushed it,§ he said. Ford was overtaken in terms of stock-market value by Tesla in April this year and the following month parted company with its chief executive, Mark Fields. The head of its driverless car unit, Jim Hackett, was handed the top job. The switch to electric cars will require a significant investment by carmakers, experts said, as the companies re-skill their workforces, invest in research and development and retool their manufacturing facilities. ※The big question: do we see this as a huge opportunity to develop new supply chains, new skills, new technologies? If we don＊t develop these, they will happen somewhere else,§ said Bailey, who claimed the government was not yet doing enough to support the industry＊s transition.Prof Andrew Parkes of Coventry University said the signal the government had sent ※creates a huge opportunity for the UK to lead in the design and development of a new generation of zero-emission and autonomous vehicles§.Chris Gubbey, chief executive of the London Electric Vehicle Company, which is making  at a ?325m factory in Coventry, said Britain already had an ※exciting, dynamic§ electric car sector 每 and so would benefit from the switchover."																																																			
"What a beautiful smokescreen. A UK ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2040 conjures up the clean, green vision of an all-electric future and is absolutely the right thing to tackle climate change 每 emissions from transport are high and not falling. But for the public health emergency of today, with most urban areas already having suffered illegal levels of air pollution for years, it does nothing at all.Ministers call toxic air ※the biggest environmental risk to public health in the UK§ which causes ※unnecessary and avoidable§ damage 每 40,000 early deaths a year. They even echo the legal obligation they have repeatedly failed to fulfil by pledging to take action in the ※shortest possible time§.Yet the killer measure to cut air pollution that shines like a beacon through the smog 每 charging or banning dirty cars entering city and town centres 每 is relegated to the option of last resort in . The responsibility of implementing these Clean Air Zones (CAZs) is also dumped on to councils, aiming to divert the flak from angry motorists towards town halls.Ministers know CAZs are the best option by miles:  than a scrappage scheme, and bring net benefits in the billions. In the government＊s judgement, hidden in the , they are the ※quickest, most cost-effective way§ to tackle the problem.The government is already mandating CAZs in Birmingham, Derby, Leeds, Nottingham and Southampton, with London is getting one too. The millions of pollution-choked people living everywhere else will rightly ask why ministers refuse to do the same for them. If designed with the right exemptions, there is no reason for pollution charges be regressive.But ministers fear the ※war on diesel§ invective of some motorist lobby groups, having themselves stoked that anger by blaming the last Labour government for mis-selling diesel as the green option. But Conservative-led governments continued the tax breaks for diesel and there is no mention of any changes in the new strategy, though it hints at tweaks in the autumn.The true villains, who ministers are letting off scot-free, are the carmakers who cheated and dodged the emissions regulations that would have kept air pollution in check. In a remarkable act of slamming the garage door after the filthy car has bolted, ministers have suggested new laws to penalise cheating manufacturers.The scrappage scheme that might assuage diesel drivers will give an entirely undeserved boost to car sales, while barely denting pollution. It＊s also the worst-value option of all those the government considered. Worse, the scheme won＊t even be put forward till the autumn 每 so much for ※shortest time possible§.The new air pollution strategy in not entirely hot air. The second most effective action is retrofitting buses, HGVs and black cabs and the ministers are putting a total of ?266m into this, though all the money had already been announced. A possible ?1.2bn to encourage cycling and walking will also be money well spent but is also old news.The only obvious new money is ?255m to help cash-starved local councils speed up action on diesel emissions. Local councils know local problems best and so should implement local plans, but the funding looks small relative to the problem. Ministers also give councils till the end of 2018 to deliver their plans 每 another 18 months delay during which children＊s developing lungs will be damaged.There is some idiotic guff in the strategy too, such as altering ※speed humps and re-programming traffic lights§. Given that these are already optimised and that moves to free up traffic inevitably attracts more drivers on to the roads, these are about as useful a cork in an exhaust pipe. They don＊t even merit analysis in the government＊s own research, which instead reckons unlikely options such as ※influencing driving style§ and cutting some motorway speed limits are better bets.The 2040 ban on fossil-fuelled cars has done its headline-grabbing job, despite simply going with the low-carbon flow and being less ambitious than other big nations. Behind the smokescreen, ministers coyly state that air pollution caused up to ?2.7bn in lost productivity in 2012, ignoring its own estimate of annual health costs of at least ?27.5bn. A government＊s first duty is to protect its citizens from harm: this one, scandalously, is still failing to do so."																																																			
"South Africa has just launched the first ever legal rhino horn auction. If you are based in South Africa and would like to buy some rhino horn you can place . This is not a government auction, although it is sanctioned by the South African government. It has been organised by private rhino rancher, John Hume, who took the government to court and won the right to sell 265 rhino horns weighing about 500 kg. Trade in rhino horn is illegal in most countries, but the black market value of one kilogram is said to be USD 100,000〞more than the price of platinum. The astronomical price of rhino horn is driven by demand in Asia that has fuelled the current epidemic of rhino poaching in South Africa. Rhino deaths from poaching have risen from almost zero ten years ago to more than  Rhinos are listed on  of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which means that horns cannot be legally taken out of South Africa into any other CITES member state. So this auction is targeting buyers in South Africa ＃ even though there is no market there for rhino horn. What is going on? Although the horn can only be sold within South Africa, where the business language is English, the rhino horn auction website is in English, Vietnamese and Chinese. It seems very likely that most of rhino horn will end up in Asia via South Africa based purchasers with links to the international crime cartels that control the illegal trade in rhino horn.Why is John Hume going ahead with this auction, given the obvious risk that it will end up generating funds for crime cartels that are known also to be involved in drug smuggling, people smuggling and other nefarious activities? Here is what the auction website says:The argument is that by meeting the demand from legal rhino horn stocks from managed rhino ranches, the price will fall, thereby reducing the incentive for poachers to kill wild rhinos. This market-based solution appeals to capitalists and of course particularly to commercial rhino farmers. John Hume owns and breeds more than 1,500 rhinos. However reality rarely follows economists＊ simplistic supply and demand models. I predict that, on the contrary, the impact of this sale will be an explosion in demand, driven by the opening up of new markets in Asia for ＆sustainably sourced＊ rhino horn. Rising demand and the expectation of a corresponding rise in price of horn will lead to a massive explosion of rhino poaching, extinguishing populations in most countries. Native range states like Kenya, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa who hold the bulk of Africa＊s rhinos will be targeted, along with Botswana and Australia, where hundreds rhinos have been imported in a last ditch effort to save the species. Even rhinos in zoos, sanctuaries and baby rhinos with tiny horns will be at risk.If this happens, in just a few years＊ time, rhinos on ranches like the one owned by John Hume may become the only reliable source of horn. These rhinos will also be at risk from poachers. But even if poachers swoop in and decimate John Hume＊s 1,500 animals, he will still be able to make a profit. He has more than 6 tons of rhino horn in a secure holding and is putting less than 10% of this up for auction. The rest can be drip fed into the markets in a way that maximizes the price increase as wild rhino horn becomes increasingly scarce. Rhino breeders may talk about conservation but their business model is literally banking on extinction. Unlike poachers who kill rhinos, rhino breeders harvest horns from living rhinos〞just as you harvest fruit, or milk a cow. These rhinos are treated as livestock. Each rhino＊s horn is regularly trimmed and the pieces are stored. Ranchers say this is to prevent poachers from harming them, but this not true. Poachers will go after rhinos with trimmed horns, which is why rhino ranches have such massive security budgets. On the auction site, Hume claims security costs him USD 170,000 per month. What could possibly justify this expense? Clearly you don＊t need 1,500 rhinos to attract tourists and rhinos don＊t make good house pets. Rhinos have no other value that their horn, so it is safe to assume that ranchers are breeding them and collecting the trimmed pieces of horn in expectation of a future sale. Hume claims the auction is ※raising money to further fund the breeding and protection of rhinos§〞but most likely he means his own rhinos. If this is not the case, and a significant proportion of the proceeds are used for the protection of wild rhino populations, he should show us the evidence. The flaw in the rhino breeders＊ business model is that the market for rhino horn in South Africa is negligible. African＊s do not value or use rhino horn. Demand comes mainly from Vietnam and China, where it has traditionally been ground up and consumed in a glass of water as a cure for headaches, hangovers and high blood pressure. But most Chinese and Vietnamese people can now get modern and much more effective medicines for these purposes. So the traders have given them an additional reason to buy the horn at any price: they claim rhino horn can cure cancer. To further broaden its appeal they promise that a few grains of rhino horn sprinkled on your rice every day will prevent you from getting cancer in the first place. I have even heard it said that a bead of rhino horn worn on a bracelet of necklace will draw out poisons and impurities from the blood. These are not ancient beliefs, they are modern myths intentionally created and propagated by gangsters as a marketing ploy to sell rhino horn to Asia＊s new rich. China and Vietnam are home to some of the world＊s worst criminal cartels. They are countries where it is impossible to effectively combat wildlife crime, and where the ego of the newly rich is driven by the thrill of consuming products from animals on the brink of extinction. Why has John Hume gone to such pains to make his auction website accessible to speakers of Vietnamese and Chinese?We cannot predict the future, but what follows is more than simply a dystopian fantasy: It may well happen. By 2020, South African rhinos on private properties will be all but wiped out. Wild rhinos in Kenya, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe will be plundered to negligible levels. South African rhino ranchers will sell their remaining animals at a fantastic price, and will all become billionaires. A gullible greedy buyer (probably an Asian with a South African passport) will purchase the remaining South African rhinos on the expectation that they will continue to breed and create more profit. They will all be poached. Values of remaining rhino horn stocks will hit the roof. People will continue to die from cancer. What can be done? It is essential that the South African government and CITES obtain samples of all the horns sold and DNA profiles of the rhinos they come from. CITES should further demand DNA testing of all horn seizures. This will allow illegal rhino horn to be traced back to John Hume＊s stock and for appropriate legal action to be taken, including against the buyer and seller in South Africa.  Proactively, attempts should be made to stop the sale and any future sales should through legal means. Lawyers should examine the legality of selling a product in the knowledge that will almost certainly enter illegal supply chains and benefit organised crime.  A massive campaign is needed to convince people in China and Vietnam that rhino horn has no significant medicinal value and to stigmatise the purchase of rhino horn. The messengers must include the leaders of South Africa, Vietnam, and China. The fact that none of them have so far spoken out to denounce misinformation about the medicinal value of rhino horn speaks volumes.  Governments of all rhino range states and consumer countries, as well as international agencies like the African Union, United Nations, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and China in Africa Forum must be persuaded to make and implement commitments to save rhinos. Measures could include outreach, education, awareness raising, law enforcement and legislation. Slavery, child marriage, FGM and many other cultural practices were once the accepted norm but are now considered socially unacceptable due to the negative impact on people, and have become illegal around the world. Similarly we can no longer tolerate killing long-lived slow-breeding endangered species to produce luxury goods just because there is a market for them. It is time for a new global convention to be adopted in which a red line is drawn firmly around certain species, including whales, elephants, great apes and rhinos, among others. ＆Sustainable use＊ of these species is an illusion and the risk of losing them is too great to accept. The world will simply be too poor without them."																																																			
"Water streams off the edges of her giant ears, runs in rivulets down the wrinkles of her slate-grey skin. She presses her whole head into the hose＊s force, the spray welling into her mouth. As she drinks, she rubs her skin against the steel fence, her eyelids drooping luxuriously, her trunk relaxing. If ever I＊ve seen a captive elephant happy, it＊s Flora this morning. There are no people laughing or pointing here at the  in Tennessee. There are no infants crying, no children arguing. The public are not allowed into the sanctuary, whose unofficial motto is, ※Allow elephants to be elephants§: give them the freedom of choice, the freedom of large areas to explore, the freedom from human gawkers (apart from via the online ) while still providing the kind of care that comes with a zoo. In fact, few things are required of the 10 pachyderms here. They can sleep in the barn or they can spend the night among the pine-covered hills. They can stay in the shade or lounge in the sun. They can wander together for company like elephants in the wild or take off on a solo sojourn. They can chase turkeys or trumpet at deer. They can take a dust bath, roll in a mud wallow, or be sprayed by a keeper, as Flora chose on this day when the temperature hits 34C (93.2F). ※I don＊t think we will ever get away from elephants in captivity,§ Stephanie DeYoung, the director of elephant husbandry, tells me. ※But is it time to change how we keep them in captivity?§ Watching her now, it＊s hard to imagine Flora 每 a female African elephant, the largest and arguably most regal terrestrial animal on the planet 每 dressed up in a silly costume performing in a one-elephant act for 18 years. But that was her life before.We are, as a species, generally fascinated by elephants. ※We see the qualities and characteristics in elephants that we aspire to have ourselves,§ says Patricia Sims, the co-founder of . ※Empathy, enduring family bonds, cooperation, intelligence, long memories, taking care of their environment 每 to name just a few.§ Some extraordinary scientific studies in the last few years have revealed just how intelligent they are. They can recognise themselves in a mirror, found scientists in 2006, one of only a few species that do this. They can have an ※aha§ moment to solve a puzzle, showed  in 2011, by witnessing a young elephant in the National zoo in Washington DC who would move a block wherever she needed it to reach food. We even know now that what makes captive elephants happy is not the size of their pen, but whether they live with other elephants, thanks to a landmark  in the scientific journal PLOS ONE last yearBut our desire to be close to these incredible creatures has led us down some ugly paths. We have ridden them, dressed them up in ridiculous attire, , starved them, and slaughtered them en masse. Today tens of thousands live shackled in prisons of our making. Elephants are still gussied up to decorate weddings in India; in Sri Lanka they are locked in religious sites as living (but suffering) embodiments of a god; in Africa tourists ride trained elephants to see wild ones; in south-east Asia elephants are used to log the very forests they once called home; and worldwide elephants are still forced to perform silly tricks in circuses and zoos, tricks they are trained to do by brutalising methods, often using a bullhook, a large, sharp, medieval-looking instrument used to create pain in an elephant＊s sensitive spots.When I ask ecologist and author of Beyond Words: What  Think and Feel, Carl Safina, if he believes elephants are intelligent and conscious, he says that there is ※zero§ evidence that such animals are  conscious, while there is multiple lines of evidence 每 both physically and behaviourally 每 that they are.So what are the implications of this? Besides their own particular form of consciousness, elephants have spectacularly good memories. Can they remember abuse and pain? Could some elephants even be described as traumatised? There have certainly been episodes that would seem to indicate this. In 1994, for example, a female African elephant named Tyke crushed her trainer to death in front of a circus audience in Honolulu. She escaped the tent and ran through the city streets for a half hour before police officers brought her down in a hail of 86 bullets. Like all circus elephants, she＊d spent her life chained up, transported in trucks and beaten to perform. The only freedom she＊d known was when she＊d escape 每 and she＊d done so twice before. (The 2013 documentary Blackfish, about a killer whale, Tilikum, appears to tell a very similar story about another of the earth＊s largest mammals.)Over and over again, staff at the Tennessee sanctuary tell me that ※elephants never kill anyone accidentally§. Like humans, they can snap. Constant beatings, solitary confinement, being chained to the floor: all this can understandably push any elephant to the brink 每 and some will retaliate.In her book Elephants on the Edge, Gay A Bradshaw argues that elephants 每 both wild and captive 每 can suffer psychological traumas, leading them to become more unpredictable and violent. ※When elephants lose their homes and families, are subjected to mass killing, and are captured and incarcerated in zoos, they breakdown mentally and culturally and exhibit symptoms found in human prisoners and victims of genocide,§ Bradshaw said in an interview with .In her book, Bradshaw describes an experiment where the symptoms of an elephant were sent to five mental health officials 每 who had no knowledge that they were diagnosing an elephant and not a human 每 but all of whom diagnosed the individual with PTSD.As our understanding of the minds of our fellow species improves, will we increasingly look back at the way we have treated them in horror and repulsion? The impact of our changing understanding of elephant psychology has already been profound. Perhaps the most astounding change is at circuses. Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey, arguably the world＊s most famous circuses, stopped using elephants last year 每 and then  this May after 146 years. Britain＊s last circus elephant, Anne, was rescued in 2011 after the Daily Mail revealed she was being viciously abused. Twenty countries have banned the use of elephants in circuses. Even India has banned elephants in both circuses and zoos 每 though the process of retiring the elephants is gradual. ※The day＊s gone by of putting an animal in a cage and calling it entertainment. I think more and more people realise that is ridiculous,§ says DeYoung. Life in zoos is generally not as abusive for elephants as in circuses. Zoo elephants are not travelling overland on a weekly basis, are not usually chained up for days to weeks to years on end, and are not usually forced to perform tricks day in and day out. But there have been enormous changes here too. Recognising the social needs of elephants, the US＊s Association for  and Aquariums (AZA) now requires that any accredited zoo must have at least three female elephants, two males or three mixed genders in order to make sure elephants have peers although facilities can apply for an expectation. (There has been less progress on space: a creature known to roam hundreds to thousands of square kilometres in the wild gets as little as 500 square metres of outside space in a zoo.)The best zoos are changing concrete cages to natural environments, adding more enrichment and taking their elephants for daily walks to increase exercise. Today, 43 zoos are members of the Elephant Welfare Initiative, which tracks real-time data on their pachyderms, all in an effort to improve conditions. And many elephant keepers now have behavioural backgrounds, an acknowledgement of the species＊ deep psychological needs, explains Otto Fad, an animal behaviour and welfare specialist. ※All of us ＆elephant geeks＊ are paying attention,§ he says.But progress is slow, and patchy. China is  from Africa, and Chinese zoos are hardly known for humane conditions. Eyewitnesses say zoos there are forcing elephants to do unnatural tricks to entertain visitors, much like circuses. Even in Europe controversy remains: In April, Peta released  at the Hanover zoo in Germany using a bullhook and whip to train juvenile elephants to perform tricks. The European Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the AZA both still allow the use of bullhooks.And then there are the 15,000 to 20,000 elephants around the world that still spend their . ※Harsh,§ is how Carol Buckley, the head of ,describes conditions in Asia. ※With little exception, they live in chains when not being dominated by their mahout to perform.§ The mahouts ※suffer equally ... [Both] live in squalor, deprived of the most basic needs.§ In Indonesia, activists have photographed an elephant in a zoo that lives alone with its feet tied together by a chain. It can＊t move a single step.So, what to do? We can＊t just open the pen doors and unloosen all the chains. If only they could all go and live in the sanctuary. No institution is perfect. Founded in 1995, the 2,700-acre sanctuary 每 North America＊s only one dedicated solely to elephants 每 has seen its own set of tragedies and challenges, none worse than when a keeper was killed in 2006 by an Asian elephant.  But it is a genuine sanctuary for once abused elephants, tended to by the most devoted of staff, who practise a form of elephant care known as ※protected contact§ or PC, a type of training invented in the 1990s by San Diego zoo. This is in opposition to what＊s called free contact, which generally depends on bullhooks and punishment. Keeper Kristy Sands Eaker says PC is about ※mutual respect§, and about positive reinforcement 每 rewards for good behaviour 每 rather than punishment. ※They know we are not going to enter their space ... They are allowed to express themselves ＃ if they do not want to participate in something ＃ they can react and there＊s no punishment for that.§At the same time, the animals are not romanticised: elephants and keepers are always separated by a steel barrier; there are always at least two keepers working with an elephant, and all are aware they are dealing with four-tonne animals capable of killing with a single strike of its trunk.The sanctuary houses 10 female elephants 每 it doesn＊t take males at this time. It has room for six more, but it＊s surprisingly difficult to obtain new elephants. After all, elephants are money makers for circuses and zoos, which are often loathe to give them up. This is why the sanctuary is never sent young elephants: the younger the elephant, the bigger the jackpot. In an attempt to create bridges between the circus or zoo world and the sanctuary, the staff say their elephants are ※retired§ 每 not ※rescued§. The sanctuary has no interest in breeding on the site. ※We＊re not breeding for animals to live in captivity,§ says CEO Janice Zeitlin. ※And this is captivity.§ Some of these elephants have harrowing stories. Sissy, stolen from the wild in 1969, survived a flood in Texas in 1981, spending 36 hours submerged under water with just her trunk above the surface. For years she was terrified of water, but after coming to the sanctuary she started wading in pools again.※This is what the sanctuary is about,§ says Zeitlin. ※These celebrations. These milestones.§Some elephants arrived with self-mutilation behaviours, such as biting their ears or tusking their own legs. ※It＊s a coping mechanism, and a lot of that is based on stress,§ explains DeYoung. I spend the day at the sanctuary with remarkable women. DeYoung moved across the country to work here. Zeitlin came 20 years ago and today runs the place. Sands Eaker worked up to the day she gave birth to twins. She told me she sometimes feels she knows the elephants better than her own children. This is not a job for them, it＊s a calling, a devotion, a love.I wonder if they are aware of the similarities between them and the elephants they care for. On the one hand, we have a highly intelligent, empathetic, deeply conscious species that has survived millions of years through a powerful matriarchal society. And, on the other, are the women of another species determined to give these pachyderm ladies the best years of their life, determined to do their utmost to heal the wounds caused by our sins.Given that they are often taking in geriatric elephants 每 the youngest on site is 33 每 workers at the facility have become accustomed to loss. In its 22 years, they have seen 17 elephants die. In 2013, they started a new policy of euthanising elephants when they felt they were suffering from irreversible health problems causing unrelenting suffering. ※There was a philosophical change,§ DeYoung says, noting that founders preferred allowing ※nature to take its course§. The final decision comes down to the vets, but includes input from all the staff. Since 2013 they have humanely euthanised five elephants.※We feel we are the stewards of this animal and it is our responsibility to take care of them 每 in life and in death,§ adds DeYoung. When death comes 每 whether due to euthanasia or other causes 每 the other elephants are allowed to spend as long as they need with the body. Elephants are buried on site and marker stones erected. Staff have observed elephants visiting the graves of their lost companions, especially those they were particularly bonded to. More then 10 years after Jenny＊s death, Shirley still marches into the wood to mourn beside her grave. But even if every zoo in the world was like the sanctuary, captivity can never replicate the wild.Conservationists rarely consider the idea of releasing captive elephants back into the wild, but it has been done. Elephant Reintroduction, a NGO in Thailand, has reintroduced more than a hundred once-captive elephants into three protected areas since 2002. The work is challenging. Premjith Hemmawath, with the organisation, says mahouts had to teach one elephant how to drink water from the river instead of the tap. Still, many reintroduced elephants have thrived in this programme, with some even reproducing in the wild.Fewer captive elephants have been released in Africa, but there are successes there too. Eight adult captive elephants housed in African countries (five males and three females) have been rereleased in Botswana. The most incredible example of reintroductions are Durga and Owalla, American circus elephants that were reintroduced into a park in South Africa in 1982. Both went on to have their own calves. It＊s expensive 每 that＊s one issue. But the biggest problem, as Safina says, is that ※there＊s no place to free them to§. Asia is losing its habitat at record rates and surviving elephants are already coming into near-constant conflict with human populations. In Africa, the situation is even more dire due to unrelenting poaching. According to the Great Elephant Census, around 144,000 African savannah elephants have been lost in less than a decade in 18 African countries. But no one has even been able to count African forest elephants 每 a distinct species 每 which have taken the brunt of . ※Welfare is a concept that can be applied to any animal in any situation, not just wielded as a weapon to attack zoos,§ said Fad. ※Does anyone thinks that a starving elephant who just had her lower jaw blown off by a hakka pata [a makeshift explosive inserted in fruits and vegetables to injure or kill any animal raiding fields] takes comfort in her ＆wild＊ status?§Safina, who has spent a lot of time with elephants in the wild, adds that today wild elephants suffer from ※more danger, stress, and harm ＃ than do elephants who live in the better zoos, where they are comfortably bored§. Compared with the plight of wild elephants, he says, ※captivity issues are a sideshow§.Before I left for Tennessee, I showed my six-year-old daughter a video about Shirley＊s life. A 69-year-old Asian elephant at the sanctuary, Shirley survived a shipwreck, a truck crash and an attack by another elephant that left her crippled 每 her right hind leg forever-after bent at an irregular angle. I held my daughter as she wept through the video, but afterwards she brightened up and drew a picture for me to bring to Shirley. I wasn＊t sure I was going to see Shirley, though. The staff said she likes to wander deep into the forest, and she was the kind of elephant that would decide for herself whether to grace you with her presence. In the afternoon, we find an Asian elephant, Tarra, and the staff proceed to give her a shower and feed her treats. But far away 每 just a large shadow-like shape deep among the tall Tennessee pines 每 stands another. ※That＊s Shirley,§ Sands Eaker tells me, adding that the crippled leg ※doesn＊t limit her. I＊ve seen her climb some of the steepest hills 每 which I wouldn＊t climb myself.§We wait. And watching Shirley 每 just a silhouette in the forest 每 I feel that tinge 每 that pull 每 so many of us feel in the presence of an elephant, like we＊re meeting a being both similar and alien, a great four-legged giant, a kind of demi-deity, a wise mother. Of course, it＊s often a toxic intimacy: our desire to be close to elephants more often than not has resulted in their suffering and despair. We＊re not elephants 每 and no human can replace an elephant for an elephant.But maybe our greater understanding of elephant needs will allow us to let them go 每 to let them be free again. To make sure captive elephants are living in places where they can be elephants again. And, for those in the wild: to stop slaughtering them for trinkets, to invite them to share this world with us unmolested. ※Oh, Shirley!§ Sands Eaker exclaims. And Shirley comes out of the forest to greet us. I take a photo for my daughter 每 since the sanctuary is not open to the public she＊ll never get to see Shirley herself 每 and I hope the image will be enough to impart that awe, that wonder, that reverence that radiates off these great beings. I hope it＊s enough for my daughter, and all of us, to extend our empathy to a species alien to ourselves. After all, that＊s what elephants would do.*   "																																																			
"Donald Trump has failed to knock the  off course despite his efforts to derail it, according to the former US vice president Al Gore.※The US will meet its commitments [on emissions] in spite of ,§ he said in London, where his new film An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power was released on Friday. ※Every other country has pledged [to combat climate change]. I think the psychological message is that the train has left the station. The signal sent to investors, businesses, individuals and civil society is extraordinarily powerful.§He said the US president was now isolated and unable to prevent global action on climate change, despite his announcement of the .※I was very concerned at his speech 每 I feared that some other countries would use it as an excuse [to delay or withdraw from the Paris agreement]. I was extremely gratified that the rest of the world redoubled their commitment to Paris,§ he told journalists.※I think he has isolated himself. Even today in the US, members of his own political party in the House [of Representatives] and the Senate are beginning to separate themselves from him, and why wouldn＊t they?§ recounts much of the story of the Paris negotiations in which he took part informally in attempts to persuade governments, businesses and civil society of the need for concerted global action on the climate. It comes just over a decade after his first film, , which won an Oscar and helped make Gore co-winner of the Nobel peace prize in 2007 alongside the scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The first film dealt mainly with the science of global warming, making clear the consensus among experts that human activities, chiefly in burning fossil fuels, were contributing to what could end up as large-scale and disastrous changes to the world＊s climate. Its sequel takes the story forward, detailing some of the probable effects of climate change now being seen, such as floods, droughts and fierce rainstorms, and also some of the potential solutions, such as renewable energy, which is surging ahead across the globe.Like the first film, the new documentary dwells on some of the remarkable story of Gore＊s life, including his term as vice president to Bill Clinton, during which the Kyoto protocol aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was signed, and the , in which Gore won the popular vote but was denied the presidency in a controversial supreme court decision to halt a vote recount in Florida, handing the post to George W Bush.Gore told journalists: ※I do not know of a position in the world with [the ability to achieve] positive change that is like the position of US president.§The film was largely made before Trump＊s election victory, but a final section examines his rhetoric on climate change during the campaign, and initial actions on taking office. As well as announcing the withdrawal from Paris, Trump has appointed several people to high office who dismiss the human role in climate change, including . He has also begun the , as well as longer-standing regulations on clean air and water, and the Guardian recently revealed that his team have .Gore said of Trump＊s election: ※It is a setback, but not the worst setback we have received. I have seen a lot of setbacks over the years. The damage I feared Trump would do has turned out to be less than I feared.§He pointed to the success of renewable energy, the price of which has plunged dramatically in recent years. In the film, he visits Georgetown in Texas, where the conservative Republican mayor has moved to run the town using only clean energy. ※I＊m not saying business and new technology will solve this on their own, but it is a tremendous benefit, a legitimate basis for hope.§Gore＊s film also deals with aspects of his own role in the Paris negotiations, highlighting efforts he made to broker a deal with the Indian government, which initially took a tough line in the talks, arguing for developing countries to continue using fossil fuels. Gore helped to win a cooperation with the renewable company Solar City that would benefit India. Though the film casts his role as pivotal, Gore acknowledged that ※there were many elements involved, a lot of people 每 President Obama, [Indian prime minister Narendra] Modi, the World Bank and others.§ He also praised the French hosts of the talks for a ※virtuoso performance§ in gaining the global agreement, particularly former president Fran?ois Hollande and foreign minister .The new film highlights the increasing threat of extreme weather. , which caused widespread damage on the US eastern seaboard in 2012, is a taste of disasters to come, according to Gore. He also spent time filming floods in Florida, the low-lying US state most threatened by climate change.Since his election defeat in 2000, Gore has made climate change his focus. He co-founded, with former Goldman Sachs banker David Blood, the fund manager , which specialises in renewable energy and other emissions-cutting technologies, and has run a series of ※climate leadership§ programmes to train politicians, businesspeople and civil society leaders in climate science. Gore, who will turn 70 in March, has no plans to let up on his globetrotting efforts on climate change. Does he have any regrets over his long and varied career? Just one: ※I might have campaigned an extra week in Florida.§"																																																			
"equins are a popular way to bring ethereal pizzazz to an outfit. But back before synthetic bling was mass produced in every shade of fabulous, the source of such dazzle could be ethically dubious but more iridescent still. For Victorian fashionistas a statement collar or cape might have been adorned with the wingcases of thousands of tansy beetles.These days, the entire British population of could probably all fit on one dazzling atrocity of a garment. Of these precious few beetles, almost all now live on the  of the river , either side of York.There are large clumps of  (here, its compact flowers looking like bunches of gold buttons. When crushed, the plant＊s foliage is so bitterly aromatic it makes a serviceable insect repellent. To tansy beetles, though, this is the scent of home. It takes my eyes a while to adjust to the matrix of feathery leaves and reddish stems, but there＊s no mistaking a tansy beetlewhen it clambers into view. It is the size of my little fingernail, bulbous and goblin green with auroras of cherry bronze and gold glowing along its curved flanks. Mid-August marks a generational changing of the guard. This year＊s parents have all but died off, and early in July their odd brown grubs, slug-like in colour and form, retreated into the mud to undergo a stunning transformation. They are emerging now as flawless adults. These summer individuals can fly but rarely do so, and their pedestrian trundle and cheerily waving antennae make an enchantingly easy watch. Close up, you can see the carapace is delicately pitted. The pit pattern distinguishes this gem from the more common but less spectacularly colourful , .Come autumn they＊ll be gone, self-interred in the Ouse ooze, to wait out winter shortages of food and excesses of water while their wings resorb and reproductive organs develop. This flood-prone stretch of river seems an unlikely home for such a sedentary creature. But saturated ground might just be a blessing, by creating a challenging spot for moles and other predators likely to target the beetles during their underground metamorphosis."																																																			
"The BBC has recently come under fire for a . This has drawn the ire of  , and rightly so. The science on this matter is settled, there is no meaningful debate to be had, and the evidence is there for all to see should they choose to go and look for it. Basically, Nigel Lawson isn＊t real. It＊s all very well putting forward opposing views in the name of ※balance§, although it＊s worth noting that the importance of ※balance§ at the BBC seems to differ wildly depending on the subject matter. You seldom get  giving contrasting weather forecasts to combat , and it seems the BBC is perfectly happy broadcasting debates about whether . Balance isn＊t a priority in these instances, clearly. But the increasingly-unhinged and militant types who insist that Nigel Lawson exists, they must be given airtime apparently. It boggles the mind. Look at the facts. It＊s ※claimed§ that  was a conservative party MP who was  from 1983 to 1989. But even this simple statement doesn＊t hold up under closer scrutiny. For instance, he was reportedly MP for Blaby. Blaby? That＊s clearly not a real place. Doesn＊t even sound like one. I＊ve been all over the UK and never seen it. Sure, the maps say it＊s , but that doesn＊t prove anything.

So, we＊re supposed to believe that an individual whose policies and actions messed up a whole country, would still be allowed on state-funded TV and radio regularly, as an authority on how something bad definitely isn＊t going to happen in the near future? Such a thing would be rejected by the writers of comic books for being too ludicrous, and yet we＊re expected to believe that not only does this person exist, but that he＊s an authority on matters that he has no experience, expertise or insight on, and that he＊d be regularly given platforms to share this lack of knowledge?No, pull the other one. The only feasible explanation is that Nigel Lawson is a fictional creation, put together by conservative and right-wing politicians and influencers in order to make them look more reasonable and professional in comparison. Sure, you can point to all sorts of ※proof§ of Nigel Lawson＊s existence. His voting records, his birth certificates, his presence in the house of lords, the fact that many people have met him and he is definitely a real person with skin and legs and everything, but this is clearly all just a front, and people need to wake up and stop scaremongering about the existence of Nigel Lawson. Because none of it makes sense!He＊s unrepentantly ? He loves Britain so much he doesn＊t want to be anywhere near it? It defies logic. And to the people who say ※he must exist, he has six children! !§, I say this: Nigel Lawson＊s most famous offspring would be TV chef and presenter, the .

That＊s the point though; this fantasy that Nigel Lawson exists is just denial and rhetoric from those afraid of change, afraid of losing out. But you can＊t shut reality out for long, pretty soon they＊re going to have to face facts and accept they can＊t dictate how the world really works by harrumphing and complaining constantly. They might get to this point sooner if the BBC, of all things, stops enabling them, and giving credibility to notions that have long been rendered farcical.

"he bell-beat of ＊ wings came with a grey dawn in early March. A pair of swans touched down in the river Teifi＊s tidal reaches upstream of Cardigan town bridge. On wind-ruffled waters they kept proximity, gliding around in search of food, accompanied at respectful distance by small flocks of teal and unruly gangs of mallard drakes.The old shipwright from the small boatyard most days ventured out of his workshop to sit on the slipway, talk to the swans, feed them by hand. They would respond with sonorous high grunts that belied their name. Occasionally the huge cob, neck outstretched, tore off downriver, wings flailing, to warn off some presumptuous intruder. This was his territory and no other＊s.By April, the closeness between the cob and the more delicate pen had become pronounced. Long mutual grooming sessions took place on the slipway. Their necks intertwined as they drifted on flooding tides. Around the middle of the month the pen disappeared. The cob held to his stretch of the water, looking muddier and more dishevelled as weeks passed. I kept watch, noted the inaccessible region of nearby Rosehill marsh to which he gravitated, presumed the nest site would be there among the reeds and hoped the otters that also inhabited the river would stay well clear.In the first week of June, scanning upriver at dawn, I saw the cob and pen paddling in golden light 每 and between the two of them was a single, black-billed ball of grey down. Over the next weeks, constantly looking for the cygnet＊s presence, I was as fretful as a parent. One cold day the pair coasted along shallows at the farther bank, the cygnet nowhere to be seen. I focused the glass. And, there, between the pen＊s folded wings, a tiny dark head was peering out. Normally there are four or more to a brood. Did  take the others? Have the frequent agro-chemical poisonings of this once pure and beautiful river, have the agri-industry＊s accidental slurry discharges into it, taken a toll on swan fertility? I don＊t know. More  needs to be done. For the moment, how precious is this little scrap of avian life."																																																			
"Grouse moors are to blame for persecuting endangered birds of prey in the Scottish Highlands and Uplands, according to a wildlife crime expert.Ian Thomson, the head of investigations at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , said data from 77 birds of prey that had been satellite-tagged showed a direct correlation between dead and disappeared birds and grouse moors.Moorland estates across Scotland and northern England are gearing up for the start on Saturday of the annual red grouse-shooting season, known as the , although wet weather and late snow have led to some shoots being postponed in the Highlands.The industry in Scotland is fighting to persuade ministers to drop proposals to introduce licensing for shooting estates, which can include pheasant and partridge, in a further effort to crack down on illegal persecution of birds of prey.Thomson said ※a very stark pattern§ emerged when tagging data for 44 golden eagles, eight hen harriers and 25 red kites that had disappeared or been deliberately killed since 2009 was displayed on a map of Scotland. It showed hotspots in the Angus glens near Dundee, the Highlands in Perthshire, the Monadhliath mountains and Speyside south of Inverness, around the Black Isle north of Inverness, and in the Southern Uplands. Some were poisoned, others shot or killed by blows to the head, but a large majority of tagged birds vanished without explanation, the records said.In May an said there was a direct correlation between grouse moors and the deaths and disappearances of tagged eagles, and the areas where eagles were failing to breed or prosper. SNH found a third of 131 young eagles tagged over a 12-year period had disappeared in suspicious circumstances or been killed, chiefly in the Highlands, although several did so on Hebridean islands or remote peninsulas with no shooting estates.In a , Thomson said: ※It is clear from this map that, like golden eagles, the distribution of illegally killed or suspiciously disappeared satellite-tagged red kites and hen harriers is far from random, and shows clear clusters in some upland areas. ※As with the hotspots for eagles, these clusters are almost entirely coincident with land dominated by driven grouse shooting management.§Landowners insist the rate of persecution has fallen sharply in Scotland because a majority of grouse moor managers and gamekeepers supported government-led campaigns to protect birds of prey. Arguing that Scotland already has among the strictest wildlife crime legislation in the world, they say official Scottish government data shows a decline in recorded incidents.※The reality, corroborated by official statistics, is that incidents of persecution of birds of prey are at an all-time low and that populations of birds such as eagles and red kites are on the rise,§ said Tim Baynes, the director of the , an industry alliance. ※Many grouse moors host good populations of breeding eagles, harriers, merlin, buzzard and short-eared owls. [The] attitude of grouse moor managers towards protected species is a world away from attitudes held in generations gone by.§ Timed to coincide with a march to support shooting estates by gamekeepers and rural traders last weekend in Edzell, a town in the Angus glens, the moorland group published a survey of 45 grouse moors around Scotland. It calculated these estates each generated ?515,000 on average for local businesses every year ※before a shot had been fired§. That figure did not include wages to gamekeepers and other staff, or the spending by clients in local hotels or restaurants. But prompted by the golden eagle data released in May, Roseanna Cunningham, Scotland＊s environment secretary, announced she was setting up an expert group to consider licensing of shooting estates, among other reforms. She also increased police resources to tackle wildlife crime.The licensing system, which the RSPB has campaigned for, would allow estates linked to wildlife persecution to be barred from commercial shooting. Scottish land owners are already at risk of prosecution under ※vicarious liability§ regulations if there are suspicions or evidence they are failing to prevent wildlife crime on their estates.Speaking in May about the golden eagle research, Cunningham said: ※The findings of this research are deeply concerning and will give rise to legitimate concerns that high numbers of golden eagles, and other birds of prey, continue to be killed in Scotland each year. ※There is every reason to believe that similar levels of persecution affect untagged golden eagles, as well as those we are able to track via satellite tags.§"																																																			
"Parents who leave their car engines running at the school gate should be fined in order to help tackle the air pollution crisis, according to England＊s official health watchdogs.New guidance from Public Health England (PHE) and the National Institute for  and Care Excellence (Nice) sets out a wide range of measures to cut air pollution, which is at illegal levels in almost 90% of urban areas.The health experts say children and older people are most at risk from toxic air and so ※no idling§ zones should be used outside schools, care homes and hospitals. Westminster city council has already introduced . Other PHE and Nice recommendations include planting more pollution-absorbing trees and hedges, training motorists to drive smoothly and to keep their tyres pumped up, and supporting cycling and electric vehicles. The health watchdogs also back ※clean air zones§ that charge or restrict polluting vehicles from entering town centres. The government＊s own evidence shows this is the fastest way to cut pollution, but ministers have shied away from implementing zones, fearing a backlash from motorists.Air pollution is estimated to cause 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, making it the biggest environmental killer. It also results in health costs of between ?8.5bn and ?18.6bn a year, according to PHE and Nice. The government＊s plans to solve the pollution problem have twice been declared illegally poor and its latest plan in May was dismissed as . Ministers are now .※Air pollution is a major risk to our health, and so far suggested measures have not managed to tackle the problem sufficiently,§ said Prof Paul Lincoln, chair of the Nice guideline committee. ※This guidance is based upon the best evidence available. It outlines a range of practical steps that local authorities can take, such as the implementation of no-idling zones, to reduce emissions and protect the public.§Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: ※These guidelines bring into sharp focus the reality that air pollution is one of our most important public health issues. We welcome the recommendations to introduce no vehicle idling areas, which will help to protect the most .§RAC roads policy spokesman Nick Lyes said: ※We welcome the principle of no-idling zones, especially outside schools, hospitals and care homes. No-one should have to suffer dirty air as a result of a driver leaving their engine on unnecessarily. Sadly, many drivers don＊t realise the harm they are causing by doing this.§Healthcare professionals should play a role in tackling Britain＊s air pollution problem too, said Prof Paul Cosford, director of health protection at PHE: ※They can advise individuals, particularly those who are most vulnerable, on how to reduce the personal impact of air pollution 每 for example, by reducing strenuous activity when air pollution is high and by using less polluted routes in towns and cities.§"																																																			
"t was only a misplaced shoe that prevented Fadila Bargicho from losing a second child when an , killing at least 113 people in Addis Ababa earlier this month.An impatient Ayider Habesha, nine, had left his older brother searching for his footwear. He headed to religious lessons in a hut next to the towering dump. Ayider was buried alive with his six classmates and teacher when a chunk of the open landfill gave way on the evening of 11 March. His body was recovered two days later.※He could not find his shoe and that was God＊s way of saving one of my children,§ Bargicho says of her 16-year-old son, Abdurahim, who usually attended the classes with his brother.While Bargicho sees divine intervention at play in the incident, the collapse at Reppi landfill was an avoidable, manmade disaster.In 2011, the French development agency (AFD)  (?17.3m) to close and rehabilitate Reppi and build a new landfill site at Sendafa, about 25 miles outside the capital in Oromia state.Oromia has been engulfed by violence since November 2015. The unrest has been fuelled by  the development of Addis Ababa 每 a metropolis of about 5 million people 每 with surrounding Oromo areas. While federal officials insist the blueprint would mean harmonious progress, activists cast it as another land grab that would mean the eviction of thousands more Oromo farmers as the capital expands.The AFD funding also covers retraining for the hundreds of people who picked through the waste at Reppi for valuable items, some of whom died in the landslide.When Reppi was established in the 1960s, it was in the countryside. Now it is surrounded by shops and houses, which have encroached on an expanding rubbish mountain.Rubbish started being sent to Sendafa, rather than Reppi, in January last year. But operations were suspended seven months later after protests by local farmers, who said the Sendafa site was poisoning water and killing livestock.The trucks returned to Reppi, where rubbish had been dumped without being treated, compacted or otherwise managed for half a century. Authorities knew Reppi was unstable and over capacity when they resumed operations, according to Nega Fantahun, the head of the city government＊s solid waste recycling and disposal project office, the responsible agency.※One cause is the return to Reppi. It＊s not the only reason, but it＊s one cause, one reason, it aggravates it,§ he says of the landslide.The government hasn＊t given up on Sendafa, a joint initiative of the city and Oromia region. But activity at the fenced-off site is limited to work on buildings and other infrastructure. Black sheeting covers a shallow bulge of rubbish to try to reduce the smell. An eight-metre high net was constructed to prevent waste blowing on to adjacent farmland but, when a gust of wind arrives, several plastic scraps soar into the air and tumble over the fence into the fields.In rolling farmland next to the landfill, local opposition to the project is fierce. Gemechu Tefera, 40, a farmer, says maggots from the landfill have ruined food, cattle have died from toxic water, and a dog brought a human hand back from the site. Consultation was so inadequate that residents thought the site would become an airport, the group claims. ※If they come again they will have to go through us. We will continue protesting. They will have to kill us first,§ says Tefera.The French financing included Sendafa＊s construction and the closure of 19 hectares (about 47 acres) of Reppi＊s 36 hectares between 2011 and 2013. Eventually, the plan is to transform the toxic site into a park. Seven hectares have been set aside for a  owned by the state electricity company, which could deal with 75% of the city＊s rubbish when it becomes operational later this year.The AFD is waiting for notification from the city government to begin rehabilitating the remaining section of Reppi. That will only begin once the site is no longer being used for dumping, says Shayan Kassim, project manager at the French agency＊s Addis Ababa regional office. According to Kassim, consultants reported that the performance at Sendafa of the city＊s contractor, Vinci Construction Grands Projets, was satisfactory and there were no irregularities in dealing with the impact on the community. Vinci worked with AFD and the authorities on improving Sendafa for a year after completion, and the government is undertaking more work following storms that caused some leakage into the nearby environment, he says. ※We know the municipality has had some problems with the landfill during the rainy season and we hope the additional works will correct them.§The local administration responsible for the new landfill＊s location supports the farmers＊ pollution claims. Shimallis Abbabaa Jimaa took over as head of Bereke district government last year after the protests. He produced an October 2016 report from Oromia＊s government that concluded water in a local well was not potable and the cause could be a river polluted by seepage from Sendafa. The area had been earmarked by the region as a productive cropping area and should not have been selected for waste disposal, says Jimaa.The promised improvements could mean local acceptance of Sendafa but, given the strength of the resistance, that seems unlikely, he says. ※No one agreed with the project so they rose in revolt.§"																																																			
"undreds of people across the UK are likely to be killed by a natural disaster this week, but their deaths will not be the subject of ministerial statements or newspaper reports, even though a failure of government policy is partly responsible.The heatwave conditions are causing preventable deaths partly because large swaths of the population wrongly believe that extremely hot days are becoming less common.While the hot weather is not as obviously newsworthy as the recent terrorist attacks or the Grenfell Tower fire, it should be treated as a national emergency that is every bit as serious. before the high temperatures over the weekend that ※for some people, such as older people, those with underlying health conditions and those with young children, the summer heat can bring real health risks§.It drew attention to the , published in May 2015, noting that there were about 2,000 ※excess deaths§ during the heatwave in August 2003, with 680 more in summer 2006 and 300 killed in 2009.The lethalness of heatwaves is often hidden because the total number of deaths is not reported until many months after they have happened. on deaths over the previous 12 months, an analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that, while there were markedly more deaths during the winter, a spike in casualties was evident on 19 July 2016.On that date, there were 1,661 deaths recorded in England, compared with the five-year daily average of 1,267. The ONS pointed out that this peak coincided with the hottest day of the year, with maximum temperatures of 31C in some parts of the country.Public Health England on Monday  in anticipation of further hot weather this week, with the Met Office forecasting daytime temperatures of more than 30C across parts of the country.The level-three amber warning, one level below a national emergency, advises people to stay out of the sun, keep homes cool, and check that anyone ※at special risk§ knows how to cope with the conditions.However, the Committee on Climate Change has highlighted a worrying lack of understanding of heatwave risks which is increasing the number of people that succumb in hot weather. found that heat contributes to about 2,000 premature deaths each year in the UK, and that this figure could rise to about 7,000 annually in the 2050s due to the impact of climate change and population growth.It concluded that ※the uptake of measures to increase cooling capacity in existing homes is currently very low§, and suggested that this may be because ※the public appear to perceive that heatwaves and hot weather have become less common over time§. on a representative sample of the UK public who believed that hot weather had become less common during their lifetimes.The study did not explore the influence of coverage of extreme weather by the UK media. Many national newspapers and broadcasters have downplayed the risks of heatwaves and flooding  that there has been no increase in extreme weather events.Nevertheless,  that the UK appears to be warming more quickly than the global average and refers to research showing that ※the maximum daily temperature and minimum daily temperature in the UK have risen by just over 1C since the 1950s§, adding that ※there is a suggestion that the warmest daily temperature extremes are rising faster in summer, whereas the coldest daily temperature extremes are rising faster in winter§. of the government＊s National Adaptation Programme, the Committee on Climate Change warned that ※there is low awareness amongst the general public about how the risks from heat are changing§.It recommended that the updated version of the programme, due to be published in January 2018, ※should contain specific actions to increase public awareness of the risks of climate change, with lead responsibility for increasing awareness assigned to a single department§.However,  rejected the committee＊s advice.  for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 每 which has lead responsibility for ensuring the nation＊s resilience to climate change 每 and the Environment Agency have eliminated most activities aimed at increasing public awareness of the risks of climate change impacts in the UK.The last few environment secretaries have largely ignored the importance of climate change adaptation. Will  break with the dismal record of his predecessors and try to save lives by raising public awareness about the growing risks of heatwaves and other impacts of climate change?"

"As the Senate launches an inquiry into the national security ramifications of climate change, a  has warned global warming will cause increasingly regular and severe humanitarian crises across the Asia-Pacific., written by the , forecasts climate change could potentially displace tens of millions from swamped cities, drive fragile states to failure, cause intractable political instability, and spark military conflict.Report co-author Ian Dunlop argues Australia＊s political and corporate leaders, by refusing to accept the need for urgent climate action now, are ※putting the Australian community in extreme danger§.※Global warming will drive increasingly severe humanitarian crises, forced migration, political instability and conflict. The Asia Pacific region, including Australia, is considered to be ＆disaster alley＊ where some of the worst impacts will be experienced,§ the report, released this morning, says.※Australia＊s political, bureaucratic and corporate leaders are abrogating their fiduciary responsibilities to safeguard the people and their future wellbeing. They are ill-prepared for the real risks of climate change at home and abroad.§On Friday, the Senate passed a motion for an , and Australia＊s readiness to mitigate and respond to climate-related crises in our region.Dunlop, a former chairman of the Australian Coal Association and chief executive of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, told the Guardian the security impacts of climate change were not far-distant future concerns, but happening now.The ongoing Syrian civil war 每 which has killed 450,000 and forced an estimated 5.5 million people to flee the country over six years of conflict 每  exacerbated by climate change, that left millions without food or livelihoods.※Once these effects start, then they unfold right the way through the system as an accelerant,§ Dunlop said. ※Natural disasters lead to social pressures, to increasing conflicts, competing claims for scarce resources. These fuel extremist positions, which could be religious, tribal, or political, which can lead to mass migrations. We are going to see a lot of people start moving, in our region especially, and to think we stop that by finessing things like ＆stop the boats＊, is frankly naive.§Dunlop said the global nature of the climate change challenge should force countries to cooperate.※Climate change has to become seen as a reason for far greater levels of global cooperation than we＊ve seen before. If we don＊t see it that way, then we＊re going to be in big trouble. This problem is bigger than any of us, it＊s bigger than any nation state, any political party.※We＊re going to be steamrolled by this stuff unless we take serious action now.§The security implications of climate change have been identified by thinktanks, governments, and militaries across the world.A decade ago,  that the security threat posed by climate change had been largely ignored and seriously underestimated.In 2013 the commander of US Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Locklear, said the greatest long-term threat in the Asia-Pacific was not military ambitions of another state, or the threat of nuclear weapons, but climate change. In 2015, the US Department of Defense commissioned a report, examining the security implications of disrupted climate, and current secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, has said climate change is a clear and current threat to US troops. Australia＊s  said climate change would contribute to state fragility, which it identified as one of the six key drivers that will ※shape the development of Australia＊s security environment to 2035§.※Climate change will be a major challenge for countries in Australia＊s immediate region.  will see higher temperatures, increased sea-level rise and will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These effects will exacerbate the challenges of population growth and environmental degradation, and will contribute to food shortages and undermine economic development.§※Instability in our immediate region could have strategic consequences for Australia should it lead to increasing influence by actors from outside the region with interests inimical to ours. It is crucial that Australia help support the development of national resilience in the region to reduce the likelihood of instability.§The Senate inquiry into the national security threats of climate change will report in December. But the issue remains politically charged.Greens senator Scott Ludlam, in putting the motion before the Senate said the government had failed to apprehend the global security risk posed by climate change.※As one of the highest per-capita emitters on the planet, Australia must play a constructive role as our region responds to climate change. The government won＊t listen to the scientists, and it won＊t listen to the renewable energy sector. Maybe it will listen to defence and security experts and the personnel on the frontline.§But assistant minister to the prime minister, Senator James McGrath, said the inquiry was unnecessary.He told the Senate a defence climate security adviser had been established within the office of the vice chief of the defence force group. As well, an environmental planning and advisory cell has been established within headquarters joint operations command, and defence is represented at the government＊s ."																																																			
"Thames  has been hit with a record fine of ?20.3m after huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames and its tributaries and on to land, including the popular Thames path. The prolonged leaks led to serious impacts on residents, farmers, and wildlife, killing birds and fish.The fine imposed on Wednesday was for numerous offences in 2013 and 2014 at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore. The  (EA), which brought the prosecution, said the enormous volume of untreated sewage discharged was unprecedented 每 1.4bn litres 每 as was the length of time over which the discharges occurred.The sewage caused long-term pollution in the Thames and some tributaries, revolting riverside users and wiping out the season for a commercial cray fisherman. The EA said it was the biggest freshwater pollution case it had ever undertaken.※This is a shocking and disgraceful state of affairs,§ said Judge Francis Sheridan, who delivered the sentence at Aylesbury crown court. ※It should not be cheaper to offend than to take appropriate precautions.§※I have to make the fine sufficiently large that [Thames Water] get the message,§ he said. Describing the breaches as ※wicked§ and noting the companies ※continual failure to report incidents§ and ※history of non-compliance§, he said: ※One has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned.§Anne Brosnan, the EA＊s chief prosecutor, said: ※Thames Water was completely negligent to the environmental dangers created by the parlous state of its works. Our investigation revealed that we were dealing with a pattern of unprecedented pollution incidents which could have been avoided if Thames Water had been open and frank with the EA as required.§Water companies have been the  and past fines were criticised as too low to deter these highly profitable companies that often offended repeatedly. But a change in sentencing guidelines in 2014 is now leading to far heavier penalties. Thames Water, which is the UK＊s biggest water company and serves about a quarter of the population, was  into the Grand Union canal in Hertfordshire and ?380,000 later the same year, after a sewage leak in an area of outstanding natural beauty in the Chilterns.Thames Water made an  and paid out ?82m in dividends. It is owned by a consortium of institutional investors, including funds from China and Abu Dhabi, and was managed by Macquarie Capital Funds, which  to Kuwaiti and Canadian investors.Richard Aylard, from Thames Water, said outside the court: ※We have failed in our responsibility to the environment and that hurts both personally and professionally because we do care. But in the three years since the last of those incidents we have learnt our lesson 每 there have been sweeping, far-reaching changes across the waste water business.§ He insisted the fine would not increase customers＊ bills: ※This fine will be paid in full by shareholders only.§ In 2013,  that the nation＊s 10 biggest water companies were the most persistent polluters of England＊s rivers and beaches. They committed more than 1,000 incidents between 2005-2013 but were fined a total of just ?3.5m, a sum described at the time as ※pitiful§ by a senior MP.Thames Water was the most heavily fined company in that period, paying ?842,500 for 87 incidents. Fines have soared since the change in sentencing guidelines but it remains too early to determine if pollution incidents are falling, due to the time it takes prosecutions to come to court.However, one source close to the issue told the Guardian recently: ※The courts have basically added a nought. Once it gets to that level, the boards and shareholders of water companies start to take notice.§The previous record fine was the in December for flooding beaches in Kent with raw sewage, which left them closed to the public for nine days. The EA called that event ※catastrophic§ and the judge in the case said the company＊s repeat offending was ※wholly unacceptable§. The company apologised unreservedly, as it had when  for similar offences.Water companies have been frequently criticised for making huge profits and awarding large shareholder dividends while paying little or no corporation tax. In October 2015, the National Audit Office found that an  to consumers."																																																			
" has one of the world＊s most sophisticated and ambitious cap-and-trade programs, which are designed to provide financial incentives to big polluters, such as electricity providers and oil refineries, to lower their greenhouse gas emissions.The complex program, which began only in 2013, is a signature component of California＊s plan to cut emissions in the midst of a controversial makeover by state policymakers, after they  a landmark bill last year that created one of the world＊s most aggressive climate change goals: to lower carbon emissions to 40% below the 1990 levels by 2030.Fierce debates over how to achieve the new, ambitious goals began before President  earlier this month to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement. That decision will likely put a greater spotlight on how California 每 considered a  每 will redesign its cap-and-trade program, which many say needs better market mechanisms and metrics to measure its successes and failures.※It＊s important to have the right architecture in place to make cap-and-trade succeed, and have it as a model for folks,§ explains , a Democrat from Fremont and chair of the Senate environmental quality committee. Wieckowski, a bankruptcy attorney, is co-sponsoring a bill, , which seeks to set new parameters for the cap-and-trade program after 2020.California＊s  sets limits on the amount of emissions businesses can emit, and it doles out, or auctions, allowances that determine how many tons of emissions businesses can vent into the atmosphere each year. Over time, the state tightens the emissions cap, forcing polluters to either spend money to buy allowances, also called credits, or find ways to cut their emissions. Companies that emit less can sell their unused credits to those that exceed their allowances 每 or keep their credits to be used later on.The California program hasn＊t been around that long, and it＊s been difficult to demonstrate how it has directly pushed big industrial companies to lower their emissions. The state collects and releases basic emissions data for the businesses that operate under the cap and trade system (the latest verified data is from 2015), and the state＊s Air Resources Board says that it expects cap-and-trade will deliver between 15% to 17% of the reductions needed to reach California＊s 2020 goal.Using emissions data from the state, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), an advocacy group, calculated that the industries covered by the program saw their collective emissions between 2013 and 2015.But whether the cap-and-trade program was largely responsible for that drop remains unclear. The state has a myriad of environmental regulations and clean energy programs in place to help lower its carbon footprint, and greater economic trends, such as a recession, can also play a role.※It seems crazy, right?§ says Parin Shah, a senior strategist at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, an environmental group, about the lack of analyses from the state and other researchers on the effectiveness of the cap-and-trade program. In response, lawmakers have proposed bills to require more data collection and studies.More detailed research would surely help a program that＊s been pretty lucrative for the state. California has collected more than $4bn that is set aside for programs that reduce carbon pollution, and more than $5bn has gone to dividends to utility customers (as credits on utility bills), according to the EDF.Like any large and complicated program, California＊s cap-and-trade system has had its detractors. The California chamber of commerce filed  close to four years ago contending that the state is imposing an illegal tax through the program. , a state appeals court upheld the program, but the chamber of commerce  that decision.The tricky part about designing functioning cap-and-trade systems, also called emissions trading schemes, is the complexity of incorporating climate science, financial incentives and effective solutions to reduce emissions from many different types of industrial sources. Politics, naturally, is also a key ingredient.※I can draw you the perfect cap-and-trade system that would be meaningless for the world if it＊s politically impossible,§ says Gernot Wagner, a research associate at Harvard University and contributor to the World Bank＊s manual on how to design an emissions trading scheme.More than a billion people live in countries and regions that have emissions trading programs, says Nat Keohane, vice-president of global climate at the EDF. The European Union launched one in 2005, followed by Quebec . China is trialling its program in several regions.※People don＊t appreciate the extent that trading programs are in place and working. They＊re here for the long haul,§ Keohane says.Some of the proposed changes to the California program are hot-button issues, such as eliminating the  by companies to meet the emission caps.Offsets are credits earned by putting money into projects, such as preserving forests or turning methane from livestock waste into electricity, that are intended to reduce greenhouse gases. The state currently allows offset projects to take place outside of the state.Some environmental justice groups have long opposed the use of offsets, which they say give companies a choice to pay to pollute rather than directly lowering their greenhouse gas emissions.Other environmental groups that support using offsets would like to require a certain portion of projects take place within the state. Creating this new rule, they say, will help improve the air quality and create economic benefits in some of California＊s disadvantaged communities.Offsets are ※a huge loophole for corporations to utilize,§ Shah says. The Pacific Environmental Network supports the elimination of offsets as proposed by the SB 775 bill. from researchers at the University of Southern California found that companies that prefer to use offsets, not surprisingly, also tend to have larger quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. Oil and power companies such as Chevron, Calpine Energy Services, Tesoro and Southern California Edison account for 60% of the offsets used, the report finds.The Western States Petroleum Association, an oil industry trade group, supports keeping the current offset program, including out-of-state offsets. The existing offset rule helps to support ※reasonable allowance prices and expands greenhouse gas reductions in sectors outside of our cap§, says Adam Smith, manager of air and climate at utility Southern California Edison.Brown has  that plans to use $2.2bn in revenue from the cap-and-trade program to fund carbon reduction programs. Brown  he wants the legislature to agree on a bill to extend or modify the program on June 15, the deadline for passing the state budget, but that deadline passed without a deal in place.But decisions on a controversial policy like this might not be able to be crunched into such a short timeframe. At the end of the day, it＊ll be politics, not an economist＊s design, that determines what the state＊s new cap-and-trade program ultimately looks like."																																																			
																																																			
"China and  have signed an agreement to work together on reducing emissions, as the state＊s governor warned that ※disaster still looms§ without urgent action on climate change.The governor of California, Jerry Brown, spoke to reporters at an international clean energy conference in Beijing about , saying it would ultimately prove to be only a temporary setback.For now, he said, , European countries and individual US states would fill the gap left by the federal government＊s decision to abdicate leadership on the issue.※Nobody can stay on the sidelines. We can＊t afford any dropouts in the tremendous human challenge to make the transition to a sustainable future,§ Brown said. ※Disaster still looms and we＊ve got to make the turn.§Brown later held a closed-door meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during which the two pledged to expand trade between California and China with an emphasis on so-called green technologies that could help address climate change, Brown said. Trump＊s announcement last week that he wanted to pull out of the Paris accord did not come up, according to the governor.※Xi spoke in very positive terms,§ Brown told reporters after the meeting. ※I don＊t think there＊s any desire to get into verbal battles with President Trump.§Trump＊s decision drew heavy criticism within the US and internationally, including in China, which  forged with the administration of the former US president Barack Obama. Trump argued that the Paris agreement favoured emerging economies such as China＊s and India＊s at the expense of US workers.Tuesday＊s agreement between California and China＊s Ministry of Science and Technology effectively sidestepped Trump＊s move, bringing about alignment on an issue of rising global importance between the world＊s second-largest economy 〞 China 〞 and California, whose economy is the largest of any U.S. state and the sixth largest in the world.Brown signed similar collaboration agreements over the past several days with leaders in two Chinese provinces, Jiangsu and Sichuan.Like the Paris accord, the deals are all non-binding. They call for investments in low-carbon energy sources, cooperation on climate research and the commercialisation of cleaner technologies. The agreements do not establish new emission reduction goals.The US has long been a major player in the clean energy arena, driving innovations in electric cars, renewable power and other sectors of the industry. California, with some of the strictest climate controls in the nation, has been at the forefront of the sector.China in recent years overtook the US as the world leader in renewable power development. But it has also struggled to integrate its sprawling wind and solar facilities into an electricity grid still dominated by coal-fuelled power plants.At the same time, Chinese leaders face growing public pressure at home to reduce the health-damaging smog that blankets many urban areas.China is by far the world＊s largest user of coal, which accounts for almost two-thirds of its energy use and has made it the No 1 emitter of climate-changing greenhouse gases.Communist party leaders pledged that greenhouse gas emissions would peak no later than 2030 under the Paris pact, and start to fall after that. They have cancelled the planned construction of more than 100 new coal-fired power plants and plan to invest at least $360bn in green energy projects by the end of the decade. The nation＊s consumption of coal fell in 2016 for a third consecutive year, but rebounded slightly in 2017. It could meet its 2030 target a decade early."																																																			
"The deep ocean and the creatures that live there are facing a desperate future due to food shortages and changing temperatures, according to research exploring the impact of climate change and human activity on the world＊s seas.The deep ocean plays a critical role in sustaining our fishing and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as well as being home to a . But  that food supplies at the seafloor in the deepest regions of the ocean could fall by up to 55% by 2100, starving the animals and microbes that exist there, while changes in temperature, pH and oxygen levels are also predicted to take their toll on fragile ecosystems.The situation, the authors note, is exacerbated by drilling for oil and gas, dumping of pollutants, fishing and the prospect of deep-sea mining. ※We need to wake up and start really realising that [with] the deep ocean, even though we can＊t see it ＃ we are going to be having a huge effect on the largest environment on the planet,§ said Andrew Sweetman, the co-author of the research from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. ※It is pretty scary.§Published in the journal  by an international group of scientists from 20 research institutes, the study describes how the team harnessed a number of climate models to explore how oceans around the world are set to change over the 21st century.※We wanted to look at how all of these combined stressors 每 warming, enhanced acidification, reduced food supply to the sea floor, deoxygenation 每 would work together to impact the ocean,§ said Sweetman. The results reveal that the future for the deep sea is bleak.By 2100 ocean conditions will have changed dramatically, say the authors, with so-called bathyal depths (waters reaching roughly 200 metres to 3,000 metres in depth) in the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans increasing in temperature by up to 4C. The seafloor of even deeper ocean regions, known as abyssal depths ranging from 3,000 metres to 6,000 metres deep, could  by up to 0.5C to 1C.Warming oceans are expected to result in lower oxygen concentrations, with levels predicted to fall in bathyal seafloor habitats by up to 3.7%. But even small changes, said Sweetman, could have a large impact, resulting in disruptions to fragile ecosystems that exist on the fringes of regions with very low oxygen. Rising levels of , says the study, will cause waters to become more acidic 每 a situation that is likely to be disastrous for organisms with shells, such as molluscs, as well as , while fish and other creatures will also be affected. Concentration of organic matter in the deep ocean is also expected to drop dramatically by 2100, reducing the amount of food available for organisms that thrive at such depths. But food is already scarce. ※The food supply these animals derive energy from in the abyss at 4,000-metre depths is equivalent to a sugar cube per square metre per year,§ said Sweetman. The worst hit, say the authors, will be the Indian Ocean, whose depths are expected to experience a drop in available food of up to 55%. ※The only way the ecosystem is going to respond is by some animals dying off,§ said Sweetman.While the team note that in some regions of the world＊s oceans temperatures may cool, the impact is still expected to be negative.※Animals living on the deep sea floor are relatively isolated from environmental change,§ said Sweetman. ※Most of the animals have adapted strategies for living under constant environmental conditions where the oxygen doesn＊t change over hundreds of years, the temperature doesn＊t change over hundreds to thousands of years.§Given the large changes expected to occur by the end of the century, Sweetman said, ※It is very unlikely that they are going to be able to adapt.§As far as is known, Sweetman said, change is happening faster than at any previous point in geological history. ※The rate of change is so dramatic that we run the risk of severely disrupting the deep ocean 每 which covers most of the planet＊s surface,§ he said.The authors point out that human activity in the oceans is likely to make matters worse, citing a rise in fishing and the dumping of pollutants as well as the burgeoning interest in deep-sea mining. ※Many of the areas that will be targeted for resource extraction lie in areas that will be most heavily impacted by climate change,§ the authors note. Adrian Glover, an expert in deep oceans from the Natural History Museum in London who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study. ※It must be stressed, however, that actual data on changes in deep-sea ecosystems are extremely scarce,§ he said. While the study offers clear evidence that climate change will affect temperature, acidity, and other factors, ※It is still in the realms of speculation as to what the impact would be on biodiversity, for example,§ said Glover.A key challenge, Glover said, is to conduct studies to explore the current state of the deep sea and the creatures that live there. ※To observe and monitor changes in our deep oceans, we need a vastly improved library of biodiversity information 每 a baseline upon which to measure change 每 and new scientific programs for understanding the fundamental ecology of the deep sea.§"																																																			
"The purple plumes of railway-side buddleias are emptied of insects. A single white butterfly is dancing, alone, in a grassy park. Suburban gardens are unvisited by red admirals or small tortoiseshells.The disappearance of butterflies from the British countryside over the past half-century is well documented, but a new study warns that they are also vanishing from UK cities, more quickly than in rural areas. Researchers examined 28 common British butterfly species over 20 years to 2014 and found their numbers  in urban areas compared to a 45% decline in the countryside. Some species are disappearing alarmingly quickly: s numbers fell by 78% in urban areas compared to 17% in rural areas; the small copper declined by 75% in urban areas, and 23% in rural areas. Because they are so well studied, butterflies are an indicator species: when they are declining, so too will thousands of less visible 每 but equally important 每 pollinators and other insects.The causes of butterflies＊ disappearance from the countryside is relatively well understood by scientists, who blame a combination of industrial agriculture, neglect of forests and climate change. But what＊s causing the butterflies to vanish from cities? The first and most easily understood cause is habitat loss. Green cities are becoming grey. The number of front gardens totally paved over has tripled from  between 2005 and 2015, according to the Royal Horticultural Society. A  found that the capital is losing the equivalent of two-and-a-half Hyde Parks of greenery a year from its domestic gardens 每 about 3,000ha (7,410 acres). Successful applications to councils for dropped kerbs to allow cars to drive over them (where gardens are converted into parking)  between 2013 and 2015.The paving over of gardens was blamed in several press reports for the decline of urban butterflies. But there＊s no simple, single cause, according to the co-author of the joint study by Butterfly Conservation, Kent university and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. ※There are a lot of different factors. Paving over gardens is definitely a problem but it＊s not the only one and probably not the biggest either,§ says Prof Tom Brereton of Butterfly Conservation.Many larger gardens have been divided up and built on in recent years, and changing garden fashions are reducing the butterfly-friendly habitat. ※Generally there＊s more artificial space now in your average garden with decking and barbecue areas,§ says Brereton, who points out that gardeners also use more pesticides per area than farmers.More widely, brownfield sites - an area of land previously used or built upon, which are some of the best insect habitats - are increasingly targeted for development. Austerity has meant that local councils＊ contractors scalp verges and green areas once or twice a year, destroying wildflowers and the insects that depend on them.※River banks and roadsides are just cut down to a bowling green as efficiently as possible to save money. You＊d think all the messages about wildlife verges would have got through, but it still hasn＊t really,§ says Brereton. ※Countryside services that local authorities provide have collapsed in some areas and been drastically reduced in others.§This loss and fragmentation of habitat particularly affects insects that aren＊t as strong fliers and are less able to find new sources of food, such as the small heath and small copper. (The powerful flying red admiral＊s urban decline has been less pronounced than other species.)Brereton cites two other major factors which are causing urban butterflies to disappear. Climate change appears to be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect in towns and cities, and so butterfly species struggle to adapt to warmer winters 每 a common problem for a number of British species 每 are finding it even harder in urban spaces.Finally, the impact of pollution, particularly from diesel-powered vehicles, is unknown but may be more significant than scientists suspect. The sheer volume of traffic is leading to higher nitrogen deposition, which has been linked to butterfly declines in the Netherlands. Researchers found that it led to a decline in plants that prefer less fertile soils. The butterflies suffering the biggest UK declines, the small copper and small heath, both prefer plants that grow in low-fertility soil. Nitrogen deposition also reduces the quality of plants. In effect, said the Dutch scientists, it turns plants into junk food for insects.Butterfly Conservation is now refocusing its efforts on towns and wants the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to adopt the annual urban butterfly data as an indicator of environmental health, and act to stop further declines. ※We want to do more for butterflies in urban areas,§ says Brereton. ※We＊re looking to develop more urban projects and engage more people.§Some cities are already engaged 每 and some urban areas even offer better butterfly-watching than the surrounding countryside. Michael Blencowe, co-author of , a new ※atlas§ of butterfly sightings in the region, says that rare butterflies including the  and migratory swallowtails from continental Europe and  are more easily found in Brighton than in rural parts of the county.※Right through  there＊s as much diversity as you＊ll find on the remotest downland valley,§ he says. ※Some of the most exciting sightings for our atlas came from people＊s back gardens.§The white-letter hairstreak lives on elm, and while Dutch elm disease wiped out most elm trees in the 1970s, many survive in Brighton. ※This is quite a rare butterfly and people have it in their front gardens in Brighton,§ says Blencowe. ※If you want to see them, you can simply stand by the Royal Pavilion.§Brighton is unusually good for butterflies because of its geology: the city is built on the chalk downs, and chalk grassland is one of the best places for wildflowers and the insects that depend upon them. In such places, gardeners can have a real impact. ※All you＊ve got to do in Brighton is go out with a shovel and spend half an hour scraping the topsoil off your back garden and you＊ve created one of the UK＊s rarest habitats [chalk grassland] in your back garden,§ says Blencowe.Brighton resident and teacher Dan Danahar has gone much further. Nine years ago, he created a  in the grounds of Dorothy Stringer High School 每 exposing the chalk beneath the standard lushly grassed playing fields and getting pupils to plant wild flowers. Unexpectedly, this little oasis swiftly attracted Britain＊s smallest butterfly, the small blue, which is rare and previously thought not particularly adept at navigating cities.※We＊ve got unbelievable numbers of common butterflies such as the common blue and small blues all over the site now,§ says Danahar.After the success of Danahar＊s havens, he persuaded the Brighton and Hove Council to adopt his vision. The council has created 25 ※butterfly havens§ across the city. You can see one, at White Hawk, from Google Earth. What the satellite pictures won＊t show are the rare Adonis blues and silver-spotted skippers which fly on the site 每 two species which were so rare in the 1980s it was feared they would go extinct.According to Danahar, it doesn＊t cost a council much to create such havens: ※Get one of your guys with a bulldozer to scrape the turf off the chalk and put some local wild flower plugs in 每 the kids put them in, and it＊s a whole community-wide engagement.§ Danahar will soon create a new haven on a steep piece of Brighton seafront. He plans to plant nectar and food plants for migratory insects such as broadleaved everlasting pea 每 the foodplant of the long-tailed blue. ※Think of the ecotourism potential 每 people travel from Scotland to see this butterfly,§ he says.In 2014, Brighton was made a , a conservation designation which helps protect its important chalk grassland, shingle beaches and undersea chalk reefs. Then there＊s the fact its council (Green party controlled from 2011 to 2015) has historically been engaged in environmental issues. Has this local political focus benefitted butterflies?※I think it has. The whole biosphere designation has helped,§ says Blencowe. ※I always hear complaints about the council, as anywhere, but they put these butterfly banks in. They don＊t look great compared to rows of begonias but they are working and there are enough people in Brighton pushing for them and enjoying them. Other urban areas aren＊t going to be chalk grassland but just planting nectar-rich flowers will attract lots of butterflies and bees.§Some councils are getting the message: Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, East Sussex and Bristol are among councils to have adopted ※pollinator action plans§. Burnley borough council estimates it is saving ?58,000 per year by reducing grass-cutting to benefit wildlife. Such policies are popular too; according to a recent survey for Friends of the Earth,  support plans to cut roadside verges and parkland less often to help wild flowers and bees.Danahar is convinced that people can help many more cities become hotspots for butterflies and other wildlife. ※We are putting a band aid back on the landscape and enabling this species to spread. It＊s not rocket science but you need the will and you need the knowhow. It＊s not about glass half empty or glass half full, we＊ve simply got to fill that glass up, and create new habitat.§"																																																			
"he world of the plastic packaging it uses. Even worse: , much of it packaging, ends up in the oceans each year, where sea life and birds die from eating it or getting entangled in it. Some of the plastics will also bind with industrial chemicals that have polluted oceans for decades, raising concerns that  into our food chain.Recycling the remaining 86% of used plastics could create $80bn-$120bn in revenues, says a  by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. But those revenues will never be fully achieved without designing new ways to breakdown and reuse 30% (by weight) of the plastic packaging that isn＊t recycled because the material is contaminated or too small for easy collection, has very low economic value or contains multiple materials that cannot be easily separated. Think of candy wrappers, take-out containers, single-serving coffee capsules and foil-lined boxes for soup and soymilk.Large companies have developed plant-based alternatives to conventional, petroleum-based plastic so that they can break down without contaminating the soil and water. The market opportunity has attracted small, young companies that focus on developing recycling technology to tackle that troublesome 30% of plastic packaging that is headed to landfills at best, and, at worst, to our rivers, lakes and oceans. Polystyrene. It＊s commonly made into products such as styrofoam cups, packing peanuts and rigid red picnic cups.Used polystyrene foam packaging has long been condensed and ※downcycled§ into d谷cors such as crown molding or picture frames. Fully recycling used polystyrene back into the same material could reduce demand for oil and cut greenhouse gases even more.Founded in 2006, Agylix＊s technology breaks the polymer down to molecules, which it sells in liquid form to refiners that will bind the molecules to form polystyrene, according to CEO Ross Patten. Agylix＊s technology can go further and convert polystyrene back to crude oil. It did that until last year, when low oil prices made it unfeasible to continue. Agylix, based outside Portland, Oregon, may find itself with a decreasing feedstock. There are legislative and grassroots campaigns in the US aimed at eliminating polystyrene packaging. Not only is it prevalent in oceans, but some public health advocates say it. Maryland is considering a ban on polystyrene foam packaging, and shareholder groups are pressuring Walmart, Target and Amazon to stop using the material for shipping. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE). It＊s everywhere: grocery bags, produce bags and Ziploc bags. It＊s also not accepted in curbside recycling programs. Some grocery stores do collect and send it to companies that turn it into plastic lumber and other products. Consumers tend to put LDPE in their recycling bins anyway, even though recyclers don＊t want it. The material has become the bane of many recycling facility managers because they have no market into which to sell it, and in turn have not instituted systems for sorting and collecting the film. As a result, it tends to gunk up sorting and conveyance machinery. Jeanny Yao and Miranda Wang, the entrepreneurs behind a two-year-old San Jose, California startup called BioCellection, are using genetic engineering to create a process that turns LDPE into chemical compounds for use in a variety of ways, including emulsifiers or cleansers in cosmetics to textile manufacturing. Their process involves feeding the plastic to a machine roughly the size of a cargo container and using a chemical treatment to break down the LDPE into small carbon-based molecules into powder form.The powder will go into a bioreactor with bacteria that have been genetically engineered to eat the powder and secrete a lipid that＊s used as an emulsifier or cleanser. It can replace compounds that currently are made from petrochemicals or palm oil, which typically comes from farms that have caused large scale deforestation and habitat loss in Malaysia and Indonesia. That has prompted many manufacturers, including clothing company  new sources.※We are aiming to make sustainable biological products using the most problematic, unrecyclable mixed plastic waste as the starting material,§ says Wang. The startup＊s biggest hurdle will be weeding out both unwanted chemical additives in the polymers as well as random substances from trash collection that become attached to LDPE, says Susan Selke, who directs Michigan State University＊s School of Packaging. Yao says she＊s mindful of the issue and is working on creating bacteria that can eat or tolerate the contaminants.Low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Color 每 the product information and logos printed on plastic packaging is what has prevented LDPE from being recycled back into film which can be used for the same applications. Cadel Deinking, which spun out of Spain＊s University of Alicante three years ago, has developed a process that removes the ink by soaking the plastic in a solvent-free chemical bath. Cadel has licensed the technology to a Brazilian packaging provider that can produce recycled packaging, a process that can be cheaper than using petrochemicals or palm oil to make the plastics, according to Adriana Pineda, Cadel＊s business development manager. (The same process also works with other plastics.) While Cadel can remove ink printed onto plastic, it can＊t remove pigments injected into it, such as a colored cap on a plastic bottle. As a result, the company can only take white or clear plastic bag or shrink wrap with printed logos.Cadel also only buys used plastic from businesses and factories instead of homes, where the plastic is more likely to get mixed in with unwanted materials. But the company has improved its machines that separate the plastic from contaminants, so it will begin testing its technology on post-consumer waste this year. Mixed-material packaging.Mixed-material packaging is made up of tightly laminated layers of plastic, cardboard and aluminum foil. Think of Capri Sun drink pouches or cardboard boxes for soup in the grocery aisle. This composition of materials can help extend the shelf life of foods, sometimes without requiring refrigeration, and is lighter than other packaging options such as glass or metal. However, separating materials for recycling is difficult and expensive to do, and few recycling programs will accept mixed-material packaging. Saperatec, a six-year-old German company, has developed a process to separate the adhesive bonds of materials by shredding and putting them through a chemical bath. The technology will then isolate and cull the materials 每 aluminum, LDPE and polyester for recycling. Currently, Saperatec does not recycle paper used in these mixed materials.Saperatec has been operating a pilot plant since 2014 and aims to have its first large scale recycling center open in 2018, according to Stefan P?schel, the company＊s head of sales and business development. It plans to recycle 18,000 metric tons of material each year. Saperatec can＊t sell to the food and drink industry because of health regulations that prohibit recycled materials for food-contact packaging. Its current plant in Germany only takes used packaging from businesses because trash from these sources aren＊t usually mixed with many types of garbage. It＊s working on a process that can separate unwanted trash so that it can take mixed packaging materials from city recycling facilities."																																																			
"Australian scientists are studying air pollution and cloud formation in  in an effort to understand how non-carbon aerosolised particles impact on global temperatures.It＊s the first comprehensive study of the composition and concentration of aerosols in the Antarctic sea ice area, a region that influences cloud formation and weather patterns for much of the southern hemisphere.The impact that aerosolised particles have on the global climate is one of the biggest unknowns in climate science, said a  scientist, Dr Ruhi Humphries.The particles are formed by molecules clumping together to form groups of between one nanometre and 10 microns. Non-carbon particles reflect light and in some cases seed clouds, causing a localised cooling effect.※You have warming effect caused by greenhouse gasses and the cooling effect caused by aerosols, and climate change is basically the difference between the two,§ Humphries said.Unlike greenhouse gases, which take a long time to break down in the upper atmosphere, aerosols disperse fairly quickly and have a shorter effect.Because the process is poorly understood, it＊s difficult to model the cooling impact increased aerosols caused by air pollution have on global temperatures.Paradoxically, Humphries said, cleaning up industries could cause a reduction in localised cooling processes. ※As you improve how you burn your fossil fuels, you are producing less soot and less sulfur,§ he said. ※The sulfur is the big one. As you go to low sulphur fuels, you reduce the sulfur that actually produces those aerosols that reflect the sunlight.§It＊s hoped that understanding how aerosolised particles form and behave in Antarctica, one of the least polluted places on the planet, will provide a baseline for understanding how the process works in more populated areas. ※It＊s this really nice test place for normal atmospheric processes,§ Humphries said.The project is being conducted with Jack Simmons, a PhD student on board the CSIRO research ship Investigator, which .Instruments on the ship have taken continuous readings of atmospheric conditions since it left port on 14 January, and researchers will overlay that data with the ship＊s mapping systems to create an accurate picture of aerosol dispersal from Tasmania to the Sabrina Coast. It is the most detailed set of observations ever taken in this region of Antarctica.※We are trying to understand what the aerosolised particles are made of and what they look like, and their size and composition,§ Humphries said. ※That will funnel into how they interact with clouds, how they interact with radiation, and where they go.§The information will allow scientists to create more accurate modelling, but Humphries said the number of variables involved in the process meant that manipulating aerosols to artificially manufacture cooler temperatures was ※not a viable option§."																																																			
"A rare, tiny marine creature known as the ※unicorn of the sea§ has swarmed in its millions on the west coast of America, ruining fishermen＊s nets and baffling scientists who are scrambling to find out more about them.Fishers along the west coast have told researchers that in some places they are unable to catch anything because the pyrosome clusters are so dense and tightly packed. Their hooks, when pulled from the ocean, wriggle with the odd-looking creatures, which are sometimes referred to as ※sea pickles§ or ※fire bodies§.The distinctive animals 每 which are only a few millimetres long but gather in huge colonies 每 have washed up on popular beaches, bemusing local residents.Olivia Blondheim, a graduate student at the University of Oregon who is part of a new research team set up to study the bloom, said: ※Right now we are scrambling to learn as much as possible while we have the opportunity.※If we continue to see this many, what impact will it have on the ecosystems here, and what economic impact on the fisheries? There are so many unknowns at this point, it really is a remarkable bloom.§Pyrosomes are tubular, gelatinous creatures that are actually moving colonies of tiny organisms. Asexual creatures which reproduce by cloning themselves, they have long fascinated seafarers, who have been pictured swimming through the middle of pyrosomes up to 30 metres long. Blondheim said no one knows how much surface area the pyrosome bloom covers, except that they have gathered right along the west coast in mammoth clusters. She said every time she or fisherman had seen them the swarm stretched ※as far as the eye can see§.Usually found in warm, tropical seas far from the coastline, researchers have been astounded by the unexpected influx of pyrosomes along the west coast of America. It began in Oregon and gradually swept north up the coast, with reports of pyrosomes spotted as far north as Sitca, Alaska. ※There were reports of some pyrosomoes in 2014, and a few more in 2015 but this year there has been an unprecedented, insane amount,§ says Blondheim. This summer was the first time she saw a real-life pyrosome in her many years of marine study. Her mentor, , a research biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration＊s north-west fisheries science center in Oregon, saw his first pyrosome only a couple of years ago, after a 30-year career in marine science.※On one of our cruises we saw 60,000 in five minutes and they were ripping apart our nets,§ said Blondheim. ※They were glowing and floating on the surface, completely covering the sea§Few marine scientists have seen pyrosomes in the flesh because during the day they stay in the depths, sometimes up to 700 metres under the surface and usually in the open sea.Dr Lisa-ann Gershwin, a marine biology expert, said ※gargantuan§ blooms of traditionally tropical pyrosomes had occurred in unlikely places before, including in the sub-Antarctic. ※Because they aren＊t wanted, and people really aren＊t used to seeing them 每 they really do impact fisheries and catch a lot of attention,§ she said. ※In the case of these pyrosomes, I don＊t think anyone is quite sure what has led to this bloom ... it is unusual. There is every possibility it is a natural phenomenon, but an abundance this gobsmackingly big also suggests there may be something behind it that is not natural in origin.§Gershwin and Blondheim agreed it was worth exploring if the pyrosomes were expanding more quickly due to warming sea temperatures caused by climate change, but other options for the bloom included the animals＊ diet changing or unusual sea currents.※One of the things we are figuring out is have these guys been off the coast and we haven＊t seen them? Are they moving inshore for a different reason?§ said Blondheim. "																																																			
"European leaders have been urged to scale up their efforts to tackle climate change as it emerged the EU does not intend to make extra emissions＊ cuts to fill the gap left by the  from the Paris agreement.At a summit with China in Brussels last week, the EU responded to the decision by Donald Trump to pull out of the historic 2015 pact by  in the fight to halt global warming.But EU sources said the bloc did not intend to alter its target of reducing emissions by at least 40% in 2030 compared to 1990 as part of its renewed efforts. And it will not ask member states to increase their planned funding for the UN＊s green climate change fund. One EU diplomat said: ※We will not fill the gap in that respect.§It will instead encourage  to tackle global warming, it is understood, in the hope that future White House administrations will reverse Trump＊s decision.A planned joint EU-China statement on increasing cooperation on  has yet to be published. It is understood that differences between the two sides during trade talks had stalled the signing off of the communique.The European commission vice-president for the energy union, Maro? ?ef?ovi?, said in an interview with the Euractiv website that a meeting in Brussels would take place before the end of the month with all the major economies and continents being represented at the level of city mayors.It is hoped the move will encourage cities, as well as US states, to play a role in making sure the world delivers on the 2014 Paris agreement. In a worst case scenario, the US withdrawal from the deal could add 0.3C to global temperatures by the end of the century, the UN World Meteorological Organisation has said.※We want to demonstrate that despite the announcement last week by the American president, our resolve on climate change is very strong, that we are going to work with all the countries who want to deliver the change, but we are also going to make sure to make platforms for the cities, for corporations, for companies, for innovators, to make sure we are going to achieve the Paris goals,§ ?ef?ovi? said.Environmental activist groups have welcomed the leadership being shown by the EU, but they called for the leaders to raise their aspirations, albeit in addition to US efforts rather than as an attempt to make good on the damage done by a lack of engagement from the world＊s second-biggest emitter of carbon. The question of whether the EU would raise its targets in response to the Trump announcement on Thursday had been left unanswered, with officials claiming it was too early to offer any substantive response.Wendel Trio, the director of the Can  energy group, said: ※The EU＊s climate leadership should go beyond lip service. It requires making all EU domestic policies Paris-proof.※EU leaders now need to move from statements to action and scale up the EU＊s Paris pledge in order to be able to reach the long-term commitment of the Paris agreement to limit temperature rise to 1.5∼C. The fact that the EU is on track to significantly overachieve its 2020 climate target means it can afford to move beyond its cautious offer for 2030.§Sally Nicholson, the head of development of policy and finance at the World Wildlife Fund＊s European policy office, said: ※The EU talks a good game on climate action, but can it follow through?※The fate of millions of people hinges on the Paris agreement and 2030 agenda being urgently translated from words into deeds. This is the only way we can be sure to improve the wellbeing and prosperity of everyone, everywhere.§"																																																			
																																																			
"An EU review has revealed multiple failings by the UK in applying environmental law, on the same day that the commission escalated its action against Britain for breaching air pollution limits.Britain has been in breach of EU nitrogen dioxide (NO2) limits , with London overshooting its annual air pollution limit for the whole of 2017 in .The Guardian understands that a ※reasoned opinion§ will now be sent on 15 February to the UK and four other countries: Germany, France, Italy and Spain. If a satisfactory response is not received within two months, a case at the European court could follow. ※In principle it could start later this year, but first we have to decide on a referral to court,§ an EU source said. ※Your goal is always to get them [infringing countries] to comply without taking them to court.§An estimated 50,000 Britons die prematurely each year from diseases caused by air pollutants such as fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone, according to the review. Six million working days are lost from pollution-related illnesses annually, at a cost of 28bn per year, it says.News of the court move was welcomed by Seb Dance, the Labour MEP who was photographed behind Nigel Farage in parliament with a sign saying ※§ last week. ※It is great that the EU is doing this,§ he said. ※It shows the value of being in the union and having recourse to action when standards are breached.§ A high-profile environmental case against the UK at the European court of justice could inflame eurosceptic passions, as fears grow on the continent about the potential shock waves from Brexit. Britain is already failing in its application of laws on air quality, water standards, and the conservation of several species, , according to the latest review.If Theresa May to turn the UK into a low tax zone off the shores of Europe because a Brexit deal cannot be reached, environmentalists fear a further deterioration.Pieter de Pous, the deputy director of the European environment bureau, said: ※This review is the latest sobering reminder of the UK government＊s shameful lack of ambition when it comes to environmental protection. ※Given Theresa May＊s extremely worrying threats to turn the UK into a tax and deregulation haven post-Brexit, any future deal granting the UK access to the single market must come with strict conditions 每 and rock-solid guarantees from the UK 每 to ensure that it complies with existing and future EU environmental law.§ Commission sources said that Brexit would have ※economic implications§ for EU environmental policy, but that it was too early to speculate what they might be.The Green MEP  said that May＊s failure to include environmental protections among the 12-points of her  was ※a clear indication that to be charitable, the environment is not at the top of her list and, to be more cynical, that Brexit is partly being driven by a desire to reduce environmental standards as part of a bonfire of the regulations§.She said: ※Using attempts to destroy our own standards as a bargaining chip is something I find extraordinary. It＊s absurd. Who would go into a negotiation like that? Our weaknesses in leaving the EU throw us into the hands of the US when it is being run by a president and cabal who are deeply anti-environment and climate action. It leaves our environment very vulnerable.§In an interview with Michael Gove last month, Trump railed against , which he claimed had prevented him from building a sea wall to protect a golf course in Ireland.The construction works would have  of the 2mm long .Conservatives hoping to lure the US into a rapid free-trade deal may be frustrated to discover that the UK is still obliged to draw up a strategy for protecting bats and the great-crested newt under EU birds and habitat laws, which will continue to apply until Britain has finally departed the union.Full compliance with the EU＊s waste recycling laws by 2020 could net 42bn of savings across  and create 400,000 new jobs, according to the EU study."																																																			
"After a week of Donald Trump＊s diplomacy, one thing is impressively clear: the US is not Montenegro. It won＊t get pushed around by some bigger leader who wants to get ahead of the rest of the pack.It won＊t lead from behind when there are deals to be done, or undone, and redone. If there＊s an international agreement on trade, security  每 especially one negotiated by a president not called Trump 每 then you know that agreement is living on borrowed time. Much like the planet itself. No, the US is not Montenegro. It won＊t accept a deal that involves some kind of trade-off or negotiation. The US shouldn＊t have to pay billions for a climate change deal when it can pay trillions in sea defenses for no climate change deal. That＊s the kind of long-range thinking you can expect from President Trump.※At what point does America get demeaned?§  on Thursday, as his unusually golden comb-over glinted in the afternoon sun. ※At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? ＃ We don＊t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more. And they won＊t be. They won＊t be.§ No they won＊t. They won＊t dare to laugh at an American president who takes a  while his fellow leaders walk like pedestrians. They won＊t laugh at a president  where only one hand survives with its dignity intact. They won＊t laugh at a president who thinks that saving the world is just another way to destroy the US. Trump knows that this world is a zero sum game where the US is losing if someone else is winning. Nothing is shared on land, sea or air. Even the sea and the air themselves.※This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,§ Trump explained. ※The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris agreement 每 they went wild, they were so happy 每 for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.§This is the kind of insight unique to business moguls and global statesmen. Especially business moguls who become global statesmen. The first sign that your deal sucks is when the rest of the world is happy because human civilization might possibly be saved. ※A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound,§ said our totally non-cynical president.Nobody in the world knows more about self-inflicted major economic wounds than . This is his specialist subject. Even China and Europe know how much he has mastered this topic, as they prepare to dominate clean energy science and technologies. Granted, there is the special relationship to consider: those ancient ties between Great Britain and the United States that mean the Brits are the Olympic athletes of self-inflicted major economic wounds. Perhaps that＊s why Trump＊s Rose Garden speech sounded so much like Theresa May＊s negotiating position on Brexit: that no deal is better than a bad deal. ※So we＊re getting out,§ Trump explained. ※But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that＊s fair. And if we can, that＊s great. And if we can＊t, that＊s fine.§As Samuel Johnson said about second marriages, this sounds like a triumph of hope over experience. And Donald Trump knows a lot about second marriages. No, the US is not Montenegro. It won＊t get its hand squeezed to death by that annoyingly fresh-faced French president who keeps inviting American scientists to move to France. Emmanuel Macron promised that he would never turn his back on Americans, even if America was turning its back on the world. This from a man who . ※Make our planet great again!§ Macron tweeted, in a brazen attempt to steal one of Trump＊s favorite phrases. Next thing you know, he＊ll be stealing all the other .France and Germany can lead Europe if they want. China can lead Asia and Africa if it wants. But the US leads the world in seeing the Paris accord for what it is: a last-ditch global effort to destroy Trump＊s coal-mining votes in West Virginia.What the world doesn＊t realize is that Trump has torn up the Paris accord because he loves the environment so much. Not because he loves it so little. Trump carries an Amazon rainforest of concern about the climate: that＊s what makes him so very upset about Paris. ※Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals,§ he explained. ※The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We＊ll be the cleanest. We＊re going to have the cleanest air. We＊re going to have the cleanest water.§See? This is good news, not fake news. Trump＊s US will be the cleanest and friendliest and most idealistic about the environment, because Trump says he is ※someone who cares deeply about the environment§.※I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,§ Trump told the world. Never mind that the good folks of Pittsburgh are citizens of the United States. Never mind that the Paris accord does more than represent those fascinating old ladies of the 16th arrondissement.So get over it, Montenegro. Join the back of the line. And take the Chinese and the French and the Germans with you., and that＊s all he needs to lead."																																																			
"It started with a mild cough. Muhanum Anggriawati was just 12 years old when the cough began, transforming within weeks into a violent hacking that brought up a yellowish-black liquid.At the end of last year, her father told an Indonesian court how she had been taken into hospital, and treated with oxygen therapy, then with a defibrillator. Nothing, however, had worked. After a week on a breathing machine, she died in the hospital, her lungs still full of the foul mucus.Anggriawati is believed to have been one of many victims of the haze, or air pollution, that regularly spreads across  because of the huge deforestation fires linked to palm oil and other agribusiness.The Global Fire Emissions Database  that in 2015, fires in Indonesia generated about 600m tonnes of greenhouse gases, which is roughly equivalent to Germany＊s entire annual output. The  such as carbon monoxide, ammonia and cyanide. A  by Harvard and Columbia universities revealed that the haze may have caused the premature deaths of more than 100,000 people in south-east Asia in 2015. The authors estimated that there were 91,000 deaths in Indonesia; 6,500 in Malaysia and 2,200 in Singapore. Anggriawati＊s father is one of a number of grieving parents in Riau who have taken the brave step of bringing a lawsuit against the police for terminating investigations against 15 companies linked to haze-causing burning activities in 2015. His suit is just one of many uphill legal struggles to seek accountability. But relief is limited. The governments of these countries have  the results of the study, citing inaccurate data. Indonesia reports just 24 deaths. We visited Indonesia late last year. Lawyers and advocates bringing cases on behalf of the families and communities told us about the difficulty they face in meeting strict evidentiary requirements to establish where the burning is occurring, who is responsible, and the causal link between the burning and health problems in affected communities. In one case, satellite images were not accepted as evidence. Judges and even witnesses may hesitate to impute causality or link the health impacts to the haze, even when there is scientific basis to support it. Lawyers and advocates also intimated that the lack of access to evidence, especially company information including maps that show plantation boundaries, makes it difficult to build a case even when the evidence of burning is present.Even more worrying are the threats to people, including government agents, who are trying to investigate and document the fires. In September 2016, Indonesia＊s environment ministry  that a team of environmental investigators were taken hostage by up to 100 men, believed to have been hired by a palm oil firm. These violent threats greatly diminish victims＊ interest in documentation and litigation, as well as their hope for effective and peaceful legal redress. Placed against a backdrop of  in judicial and law enforcement systems, all these factors make potential litigation unappealing and burdensome for victims.Legal accountability and access to justice are vital to this fight. While strong executive acts and voluntary company measures such as certification and zero-burning policies are helpful, it is even more important that those responsible are held to account. To be fair, the governments concerned have taken some measures to increase legal accountability. The  in Singapore creates both civil and criminal offences ※for any entity to engage in conduct, or to condone conduct, causing or contributing to haze pollution in Singapore§. Last year, Singapore＊s National Environment Agency issued preventive measures notices to six Indonesian companies suspected of starting fires. And in June 2016, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry said that it was  over alleged forest fires the year before.Communities and NGOs are also engaged in various efforts to promote increased accountability. Greenpeace has set up an  showing company concessions and active fires to create more transparency on land tenure.  provides public data showing the role of finance in deforestation and aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt policies to prevent funding of this practice. NGOs are helping empower communities to document their experiences related to haze, including through the use of technology.Groups are advocating for better laws in their respective jurisdictions. Communities and government officials are also working together , and have been successful in a number of the cases that have already been . For example, the Indonesian  ordered palm oil company PT Kallista Alam to pay a record amount of $26m (?21m) in fines and reparations for its cut-and-burn practices in the Tripa peat swamp region.But these efforts must be accompanied by heightened measures to remove barriers to legal accountability and ensure that in cases of abuse, communities are able turn to courts as powerful and effective instruments for remedy and justice. In all the countries concerned, there should be collective action to: increase the capacity of courts to handle environmental cases; address corruption in law enforcement and judicial systems; require greater transparency among companies; promote access to information; and ensure the personal security of investigators and seekers of justice."																																																			
"Donald Trump＊s  is the most emphatic answer to date on the question the rest of the world has been asking since January: What does ※America first§ mean?※I am elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,§ the president declared in the White House rose garden, after a jazz group had entertained the invited audience.With those words,  in rejection of an accord signed by 195 states which was voluntary and open to amendment from within. The UN climate change envoy, Ireland＊s former president, Mary Robinson, declared the decision made the US ※a rogue state on the international stage§.To US allies, Trump＊s departure is an entirely needless piece of diplomatic and environmental vandalism, performed on live television for ratings. For Trump＊s embattled administration, however, ratings are now all-important to stave off disillusion among his core voters, who needed to hear to more of the combative populist they had warmed to on the campaign trail.But emphatic does not necessarily mean coherent. On a string of issues, Trump has pulled back from delivering some of the bold unilateralist policies he had used to stir up crowds during the campaign. He has not dismantled the nuclear deal with Iran, nor has walked out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), and , which would have been seen as a provocation in the Islamic world and beyond.But Thursday＊s climate announcement marked a return to angry populism. It was Trump＊s darkest speech since his ※American carnage§ inaugural address, once more portraying a nation in crisis and facing a global conspiracy against its people. The world was presented as something to fear rather than to aspire to lead. The battle between continuity and radical departure swings back and forth each day between the self-styled populist ※disruptors§ led by Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, and the ※traditionalists§ brought on since the election to lend gravitas to the presidency, such as Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state; the national security adviser, HR McMaster; and the defence secretary, James Mattis. Between these two camps and somewhat above them is the family, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. But their influence is clearly not decisive. On the Paris accord, they leaned heavily toward the traditionalists and lost.The perpetual tussle has led to unpredictability. In the run-up to Trump＊s turbulent trip to Brussels last week, reporters and diplomats were told by White House officials that he would explicitly re-commit the US to the mutual defence clause of the alliance, article 5. .Defence expenditure has been a longstanding irritant in the North Atlantic alliance, but it was the vituperative nature of Trump＊s delivery, combined with his petulant body language, that convinced the allies they had better look to each other if they wanted a sense of direction.McMaster and Trump＊s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, wrote a commentary earlier this week seeking to sketch out an overarching rationale for Trump foreign policy.  ※The president embarked on his first foreign trip with a clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a ＆global community＊ but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage,§ , pointing out that in such an arena, the US had a decisive edge in ※unmatched military, political, economic, cultural and moral strength§.※Rather than deny this elemental nature of international affairs, we embrace it,§ McMaster and Cohn wrote. But in the same piece, they also imply almost the exact opposite: ※＆America first＊ does not mean America alone. It is a commitment to protecting and advancing our vital interests while also fostering cooperation and strengthening relationships with our allies and partners.§Missing from the argument is an explanation of how those very different ideas can be reconciled. It does not make clear how the US can show moral strength and foster cooperation when it approaches foreign policy as a ruthless struggle for national supremacy.There is nothing new in these dilemmas. They have swung the US from engagement to isolation and back for more than a century. The ※America first§ slogan was used by isolationists in the run-up to the second world war, led by Charles Lindbergh, who presented it in bluntly racial tones. The George W Bush administration started out in 2001 by , the forerunner of the Paris accord, dead, and by ※unsigning§ the Rome statute establishing the international criminal court the following year. It was deeply sceptical of any multilateral endeavour, at least until it became hopelessly mired in Afghanistan and Iraq. What is new about the Trump administration is its chaotic nature and the undisciplined character of its chief executive. For US allies, trying to follow Washington＊s lead over the past four months has been akin to trying to drive in convoy behind a car swerving violently at high speed, as the competing factions inside lunge for the steering wheel. One by one, Washington＊s friends are making the decision to stop trying and chart their own course."																																																			
"Air pollution is a crisis that ※plagues§ the UK, particularly children,  on hazardous substances and wastes.Baskut Tuncak, who was appointed by the UN human rights council and completed a 15-day mission to the UK on Tuesday, said there was an ※urgent need for political will by the UK government to make timely, measurable and meaningful interventions§.Most air quality zones in the UK breach legal limits and the government has twice had its plans to tackle the issue . It is now  but Tuncak＊s strong criticism is a further embarrassment for ministers. ※The UK has repeatedly not been among the more progressive EU member states on debates over the development of stronger health and environmental protections,§ he said.Tuncak also said  was a threat to environmental protection given that most current regulations come from the EU. ※I found no indication of a political commitment to retaining current standards for health and environmental protection,§ he said.The government says it will transpose all EU laws into UK law via a ※great repeal act§, but the  that about a third of the 800 pieces of EU environmental legislation would be difficult to transfer. A cross-party committee of MPs said earlier in January that the government  before it begins the formal process of leaving the EU.Tuncak also found that less than 1% of workers made sick by exposure to toxic chemicals receive compensation in the UK. ※For victims of toxic pollution, seeking remedy in the UK is very difficult,§ he said. ※Cuts in legal aid have made it near impossible for victims of pollution and contamination to seek remedy for civil suits.§Tuncak＊s fact-finding mission to the UK was at the invitation of the government and assessed the measures taken by the government to protect the human rights of people that can be infringed by pollution, such as the rights to life, health and safe housing.The visit coincided with a  and he said between 30,000 and 40,000 early deaths every year are caused by toxic air across the country.※Air pollution plagues the UK,§ Tuncak said. ※Children, women of reproductive age, the elderly, and those of poor health are the most threatened by toxic air, with poorer communities often exposed at higher levels. Paediatricians refer to the present state of the impacts of pollution and contamination on children＊s health as a ＆silent pandemic＊. I encourage the UK government to fulfil its human rights obligations on air pollution.§Regarding the changes that will result from the UK leaving the EU, he said the UK has an obligation to progress, not to slide backwards: ※The forthcoming plan for Brexit should ensure that it does not open a Pandora＊s box, freeing the way for deregulation and posing a threat of regression from existing standards of protection.§Tuncak said the UK＊s ※pivot§ away from the EU towards closer cooperation with the US, pursued by prime minister Theresa May in Washington DC last week, risked a weakening of protection. ※Rights that are often impacted by pollution and contamination are not recognised by the US while they are by the UK,§ he said.During Tuncak＊s mission, he met representatives of the national government. But regarding assurances that Brexit would not weaken protections, he said: ※I was pointed to statements that I could not find and political commitments that were not clearly expressed.§A government spokesman said: ※We have been very clear we are committed to safeguarding and improving the UK＊s long history of environmental protection, and securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU. Furthermore, we will remain subject to international environmental protection conventions, such as Ramsar, Gothenburg and Bern, independent of EU membership.§A Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner Oliver Hayes said: ※Mr Tuncak is correct 每 UK air pollution is a national disgrace, and ministers must do far more to protect the health of our children and other vulnerable people. It＊s essential that current EU legal protections are safeguarded in UK law post-Brexit 每 and crucial that these air-quality rules are far more rigorously enforced.§Tuncak also reported a series of other findings:A full report of Tuncak＊s mission will be submitted to the human rights council in September."																																																			
"The science of climate change is clear. Scientists know that the Earth is warming and that humans are the reason. We also know that the Earth will continue to warm in the future; however, we can do something about it. We can dramatically change the trajectory.If the science is so clear, why are there still so many people that don＊t accept it? Why are there so many people who try to deny the evidence? Well, the why is something I will try handling in my next post. Here, I want to describe where things are, as I see them. Mind you, this is only my perspective, living in the USA, working on climate science and climate communication on a daily basis.For various reasons, acceptance of climate science breaks down along ideological lines. First, . It turns out, however, that there is higher acceptance of climate science and acceptance of the importance of action on the coasts (California, Oregon, Washington, New York, etc.). There are exceptions to this rule but I am generalizing. It also turns out that the more liberal your politics are, the more likely you are to accept the science and the solutions. With respect to politics, the results are stunning. Vast majorities of Democratic and independent voters are supportive. Interestingly, small majorities of even conservative  are supportive.There are other correlations. For instance, the more religious, particularly conservatively religious someone is, the more likely they are to doubt or deny the science. But again, this is a generalization and it has exceptions. In fact, some religious leaders have become climate-action leaders. Perhaps the best example is . Now, I am not saying that conservatives are not as intelligent as liberals, I am just pointing out that certain political and religious ideologies correspond to viewpoints on science.The correlations don＊t end here. A hugely important work on the underlying motivations of people who deny the reality of climate change was performed by Dr. Naomi Oreskes in her book (and accompanying movie) . One of her central conclusions is that the denial of human-caused climate change is driven by peoples＊ distrust of the government and of government solutions to a problem, particularly when the solutions may impinge on personal freedoms. While there is a clear relation between a scientist＊s knowledge of climate change and their understanding of the human influence, such a relation is not apparent in the general public. So, if you look far and wide to find a scientist who claims humans are not a major influence on climate, it is very likely that scientist is not very knowledgeable about the topic, does not work in the area very much, or has a history of faulty research. Conversely, the scientists who accept the consensus view are more likely to publish more, do more research and just know more. However, if you talk to people on the street, this view breaks down. I see this in my own interactions with people. I often run across general audience members who have a pretty good grasp of the science but they discount the effects. Or, people who know very little about the science but they fully accept it. What is most astonishing to me is where this all leaves us.  that America will withdraw from the Paris climate treaty. My view is, it would be better for us to leave the agreement so we cannot sabotage it from the inside. But, only time will tell.But back to where this leaves us. We have a situation in the USA and around the world where certain countries and certain political groups have inextricably aligned themselves with one or another side of this issue. For instance, in the USA, denial of human-caused climate change has become a litmus test for Republican candidates. The same is true in other countries. This is a real tragedy because Republicans don＊t want to pollute the planet. They don＊t want to screw things up for our future generations. But, their wholesale denial of the reality of climate change is doing just that.From a political standpoint, if we think about the silly things President Trump is doing and how it will affect the world, . Climate change will have very long lasting consequences that we will be dealing with long after he is gone. Long after other issues like immigration, the economy, debt, jobs, terrorism, or new words like ※covfefe§ have passed from our minds, the implications of our climate effect will linger. Frankly, no challenge we are facing (except perhaps a potential nuclear war) presents the consequences that climate change does. And this, sadly, will be the legacy of conservatives in my country. As we wake up to more severe weather, more droughts, heat waves, rising seas, severe storms, the world will remember that these issues could have been solved long ago but for an ideology and tribalism. It will be the job of scientists, historians, and the media to continually remind people of this.  could have been solved. Those who will be blamed will certainly claim ※But I didn＊t cause this climate change. You cannot blame this on me!§ But we can and we have to. People need to be accountable for their actions. If you are someone who has stood in the path of climate action, you own the results.And that is the sad part. Because as I mentioned earlier, this means a significant part of the population will be tarred with the legacy of climate change. And that population does not, as a rule, want the climate to change. No one wants sea levels to rise or droughts to increase. But this observation does not change the fact that without the obstruction of climate action, we would be in a very different place. Another sad result is that my country has become a pariah 每 we have gone from leader to obstructionist on climate change. This saddens me. What is ironic is that many of the people who deny human-caused climate change are the same people who live and breathe so-called ※patriotism.§ But this patriotism has become a ※my country right or wrong§ parochial slogan that is anything but patriotic. To call your country what it is, to be honest about our strengths and our shortcomings, to work to make your country better, to never settle for status quo 每 that is patriotic. And as a patriot, I am deeply saddened by my country＊s lack of leadership on this important issue. And as a patriot, I will hope for, and work for change.Next time, I will give my personal opinion about why some people are more likely to deny the reality of climate change. Again, these will be from my personal observations and discussions with others. I am not claiming to be an expert in psychology or similar sciences. However, I＊ve had enough experience to feel confident in my conclusions. I hope you will read my next post."																																																			
"The UK＊s two largest supermarket chains have committed to end the sale of cotton buds with plastic stems, which are the most common litter from toilets flushed on to the country＊s beaches.Both  and Sainsbury＊s will replace the plastic stick with paper by the end of 2017 in their own-brand products.Other major companies, including Morrisons, Asda and Boots, are currently considering a plastic ban, while , the Co-operative and Johnson & Johnson have already committed to paper stems.

"Donald Trump has confirmed that he will withdraw the US from the , in effect ensuring the world＊s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases will quit the international effort to address dangerous global warming.The US will remove itself from the deal as the only countries not party to the Paris agreement. There will be no penalty for leaving, with the Paris deal based upon the premise of voluntary emissions reductions by participating countries.※In order to fulfil my solemn duty to the United States and its citizens, the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accords or a really entirely new transaction, on terms that are fair to the United States,§ the US president told press in the White House rose garden on Thursday.※We will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that＊s fair,§ Trump said. ※If we can, that＊s great. If we can＊t, that＊s fine.§But shortly after Trump＊s speech saying they believed the treaty could not be renegotiated. Trump told the crowd outside the White House: ※The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world＊s top polluting countries should expel any doubt as to why foreign lobbyists should wish to keep our beautiful country tied up and bound down ＃ That＊s not going to happen while I＊m president, I＊m sorry.§He added: ※I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.§Trump＊s predecessor, Barack Obama, issued a rare statement saying the new administration had joined ※a small handful of nations that reject the future§. But he said that US states, cities and businesses ※will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we＊ve got§.Former vice-president Al Gore  the move ※reckless and indefensible§, while among the business leaders to express regret over the move was Jeff Immelt, chair and CEO of General Electric, who  ※climate change is real§ and ※industry must now lead§. Trump, who spoke after being introduced by a  playing the George Gershwin classic Summertime, argued that the Paris agreement disadvantaged the US to the benefit of other countries, leaving workers and taxpayers to absorb the costs and suffer job losses and factory closures. As of today, he said, the US will cease implementation of the nationally determined contribution and green climate fund, ※which is costing the US a vast fortune§.In 2015,  in order to prevent the runaway climate change that or more above the pre-industrial era.Trump＊s decision risks destabilizing the Paris deal, with  of trying to make up the shortfall in emissions cuts or following the US＊s lead and abandoning the agreement. The US emissions reduction pledge accounts for a fifth of the global emissions to be avoided by 2030, with an analysis by not-for-profit group Climate Interactive showing that a regression to ※business as usual§ emissions by the US could warm the world by an additional 0.3C by 2100. This would help push the global temperature rise well beyond 2C, causing punishing heatwaves, sea level rise, displacement of millions of people and the loss of ecosystems such as coral reefs. The US withdrawal would not, though, derail global efforts to fight climate change, said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who delivered the Paris agreement. ※States, cities, corporations, investors have been moving in this direction for several years and the dropping prices of renewables versus high cost of health impacts from fossil fuels, guarantees the continuation of the transition.§The US will be the loser from its withdrawal, said Prof John Schellnhuber, a climate scientist and former adviser to the EU, Angela Merkel and the pope. ※It will not substantially hamper global climate progress but it will  and society alike,§ he said. ※ on the path towards green development already and will strengthen their position if the US slips back.

John Kasich, the governor of Ohio and a frequent critic of Trump, said he shared concerns about ※flaws§ in the treaty. ※I＊m convinced we can correct them and improve the agreement, however,§ he said, ※by showing leadership and constructively engaging with like-minded nations, not by joining the ranks of holdouts like Syria and Nicaragua.§Bernie Sanders, the leftwing senator and former Democratic presidential hopeful, called the move an ※international disgrace§ and an ※abdication of American leadership§.But House speaker Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress, threw his support behind Trump＊s decision, saying the Paris accord was ※simply a raw deal for America§.※In order to unleash the power of the American economy, our government must encourage production of American energy,§ Ryan said in a statement. ※I commend President Trump for fulfilling his commitment to the American people and withdrawing from this bad deal.§Trump followed through with his campaign pledge to ※cancel§  following months of conflicting signals over whether he would do so or just scale back the US ambition to cut emissions. The withdrawal represents a victory for the nationalist elements in Trump＊s administration, such as his strategist Steve Bannon, who have argued the Paris deal undermines an ※America first§ approach, harms domestic coal production and hinders efforts to repeal Barack Obama-era regulations such as the Clean Power Plan. On Tuesday, Trump met with  who has called Paris a ※bad deal§ that should be discarded.In his speech, Trump sought to frame his decision as part of this nationalist agenda. ※The Paris agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country＊s expense,§ he said. ※They don＊t put America first. I do, and I always will.§A group of , headed by majority leader Mitch McConnell, backed the anti-Paris view in a letter to Trump that urged a ※clean exit§ from the Paris deal, which they said added a ※regulatory burden§ upon the US.The anti-agreement faction had jockeyed for Trump＊s favour over a rival school of thought, including secretary of state Rex Tillerson and Ivanka Trump, the president＊s daughter and adviser, that argued the US should remain in the Paris deal in order to preserve its diplomatic influence.Hundreds of large businesses, including Apple, Google and Walmart, also, with even fossil fuel firms such as ExxonMobil, BP and Shell supporting the accord as the best way to transition to a low-carbon economy and stave off the perils of climate change.In a bid to calm the frayed nerves of countries most at risk from rising temperatures, the EU and China  earlier on Wednesday. Their joint declaration called climate change a ※national security issue§ and a ※multiplying factor of social and political fragility.§ The Paris pact is a ※historic achievement§ and ※irreversible§, the document says.※It is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris agreement,§ said UN secretary general Ant車nio Guterres. ※If one country decides to leave a void, I can guarantee someone else will occupy it.§Environmental groups were scathing of Trump＊s decision, with more than 20,000 members of the Sierra Club calling the White House within hours of reports that the president had opted to exit the deal. ※Donald Trump has made a historic mistake which our grandchildren will look back on with stunned dismay at how a world leader could be so divorced from reality and morality,§ said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, said he will sign an order committing the city to the Paris deal due to the ※destructive power§ of disasters like Hurricane Sandy."																																																			
"It isn＊t a great surprise to learn that a director of Greece＊s Public Power Corporation believes in exemptions for lignite 每 an especially polluting type of coal burnt at Greek power plants (, theguardian.com, 24 November). However, the claim that Greece is ※among the best performers in emission reductions§ must not go unchallenged.In a recent report, , we revealed how Greek lignite plants, responsible for hundreds of premature deaths and thousands of cases of respiratory illness every year, have in fact been granted special exemptions to EU limits set in the industrial emissions directive. As a result, when it comes to emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO), nitrous oxides (NO), dust and mercury, Greek plants are undoubtedly among the worst performers in Europe.Comparing the emission levels of lignite plants in  and Germany is revealing: Greek levels are almost four times higher for sulphur, twice as high for nitrous oxides and 17 times higher for dust. Over five years, Greek exemptions will allow an extra 78 kilotons of SO and 21 kilotons of dust. It would take Dutch coal plants more than 100 years to emit that much dust.Furthermore, Greece is now seeking to extend exemptions for two highly polluting lignite plants: Kardia and Amyntaio. Resulting additional health costs will cost the Greek taxpayer billions of euros.If we are serious about protecting human health, the environment and the climate, the road to a fossil-fuel free future must remain a one-way street. Lignite can have no place in that future. In  to your report (, theguardian.com, 3 November) about Greece＊s desperate plea to gain free emission allowances, the Greek Public Power Corporation (GPPC) avoids the main issue: its two new lignite plants won＊t be economically viable unless they are allowed to emit CO without paying, a fact that even GPPC＊s CEO admits.Greece＊s numbers are hardly representative of a ※best performer§. It is , and is one of only two EU countries with a growing energy intensity, mainly due to lignite＊s share in national greenhouse gas emissions (34%, second largest in EU-28).Lignite＊s drop in the electricity share, referred to in GPPC＊s letter, is partially due to the emissions trading system. This is precisely what GPPC is trying to reverse through free emission allowances. Contrary to its claim, Greece is indeed trying to revive its lignite-based model: it is committed to constructing two new lignite plants, is currently trying to double the operating hours of two existing plants, tried very hard to extend the life of its oldest plant, and is attempting to do the same with another one.GPPC refers to the country＊s long-term energy plan, which in fact does not exist. What is, however, crystal clear is GPPC＊s aspiration to keep lignite＊s share at at least 35%, as its CEO has repeatedly stated.Free emission allowances for Greece mean that Ptolemaida V may benefit from operating cost reductions, thus gaining operating hours, and hence revenue. Without them, its construction and operation is financial suicide. "																																																			
"The most important international agreement to tackle climate change is about to be dealt a severe blow 每 but Theresa May is nowhere to be found.Donald Trump is expected to withdraw the , in which  to arrest the rise in global temperatures. Such a decision from the US will heighten the risk of a climate disaster, with all the damaging consequences to food supply, the global economy and our security.Experts in the UK have made clear that climate change is a , and Trump＊s own defence secretary . Donald Trump＊s actions put us all in greater peril.Yet in the face of this threat, May is silent. We have a prime minister who is weak on the world stage and complicit in Trump＊s world-harming act. While our  and other developing countries to confront Trump and strengthen their efforts on climate change, Theresa May hasn＊t issued a word of criticism. Whereas France＊s new president used  in the Paris agreement, our prime minister failed to even mention it during her fawning trip to Washington in January.This is unacceptable. Just as Donald Trump is abrogating America＊s responsibility to lead the fight against climate change, Theresa May is evading Britain＊s role. Instead of holding hands with Trump at the White House and rolling out the red carpet for him in London, the prime minister must stand up to him and convince him to keep America in the Paris agreement. Instead of the lavish trappings of a , Trump should be greeted with robust British diplomacy. After all, what is the good of a special relationship unless we＊re prepared to use it?May＊s lack of leadership on this issue is appalling, but perhaps not all that surprising. One of her first acts as prime minister was to . She＊s sold off the  that we established in coalition, and is now calling for a . Nick Timothy, her chief of staff and righthand man, wrongly called the Climate Change Act a . No wonder her policy on climate change is so weak.What＊s most disappointing about May＊s failure on climate change is that Britain played such a pivotal role in securing international agreement on it in the first place. As the energy and climate change secretary in the coalition government,  that paved the way for success at the Paris conference. It was a clear demonstration of the influence Britain can wield as a member of the EU 每 influence that is particularly crucial in the face of global threats such as climate change. Only through international cooperation will we prevent catastrophe.We now have to face the reality of an American president who ignores the scientific consensus that climate change is real and calls it . Clearly reason and evidence won＊t change Trump＊s mind, so we must bring international pressure to bear instead. If Trump does not face a backlash from the UK and other nations over this, he will take it as a sign that he can ride roughshod over any number of other international agreements in the future.With  in the White House, British leadership on the world stage is more important than ever. We should be working with our European allies, not turning them into opponents. We should be redoubling our own efforts to combat climate change, not watering them down. And we should be speaking out loud and clear against Trump＊s irresponsibility. If this election is about leadership, it＊s clear yet again that Theresa May has been found wanting."																																																			
"Plans for independent checks of how much pollution new cars emit are being killed off by EU member states, according to leaked documents seen by the Guardian. After the , the European commission proposed empowering its respected science wing, the , to inspect vehicles separately from national authorities, which are .But an EU pledge to ※organise and carry out§ emissions tests has been deleted from a draft regulation, which will be discussed by EU ministers this week in Brussels. Julia Poliscanova, a spokeswoman for the green campaign group, Transport and Environment, said: ※There is a Mexican standoff going on, with governments afraid to act against their own fraudulent carmakers for fear it will put their domestic industry at a competitive disadvantage.※This scandalous stalemate results from national governments prioritising the interests of domestic carmakers above citizens＊ need to breathe clean air. National vehicle regulators in  have been captured by the car industry.§Millions of polluting cars remain on European roads, despite  that they emit three times the current standard for nitrogen oxide pollution, when driven in real world situations. Last week, the European Environment Agency  caused by air pollution in Europe each year to 467,000.  Since the  broke a year ago, many VW group cars fitted with illegal software have been recalled in Europe, and 660,000 vehicles from Renault, Fiat, Opel and Mercedes could be voluntarily recalled, if their owners request it. But no other action has been taken to fix the millions of excessively polluting vehicles on the continent＊s roads, 69% of which were sold in the UK, Germany, France and Italy. France is the only one of these countries to support independent emissions tests in meetings of the relevant EU working party, according to T&E.Modest requirements for the EU to monitor national emissions tests and ensure that regulators are consistently applying rules have also been watered down in the draft regulations＊ text. Europe＊s car regulations have historically provided a global benchmark for best emissions practice, everywhere except North America and Japan. But after the VW scandal, countries such as China have begun realigning their systems with US testing norms, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, which first revealed the Dieselgate story. A final decision on the new European emissions testing regime is expected in February. "																																																			
"A smell of burning coal fills the chilly air as delegates pile into the conference chamber. Outside, protestors shiver in polar bear suits under threatening skies and forbidding grey concrete; inside, smiles, colourful costumes and a warm glow. Negotiators, politicians, activists who have spent their lives fighting climate change are jubilant. The US has stalled global action on climate change for two full presidential terms, but no longer. In the chamber, at last, the White House meltdown is in full flow.This is no vision of a future under Donald Trump: it was the disaster and backtracking that marked the end of climate negotiations for his Republican predecessor, George W Bush, in 2008. Then, as now, a US president in thrall to oil interests tried to block international agreement on emissions. Then, as now, doomsayers foresaw a deathblow to the UN climate negotiations. Then, as now, the US economy was drunk on cheap fossil fuels.As  pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, reversing anti-carbon measures at home and trashing climate science, it is worth remembering how the last one ended: in humiliating defeat. Only this time, the world has changed. , the US public, and the world＊s next biggest economy, . This time a defeat is even more likely, and even more damaging to the US＊s interests and economy.The closest advisor to George W Bush 每 some said the real power in the White House 每 was vice-president Dick Cheney, a former oil industry executive fanatically opposed to action on greenhouse gases. Aided by Republican majorities in Congress, he rubbished climate science, promoted denialist views, resisted efficiency standards, and blocked moves to cut emissions.When the  came into force in 2005, rejuvenating the lacklustre UN negotiations on global climate protection, Cheney stood firm against joining the rest of the world. So the US, alone apart from Australia and a handful of tiny players, refused to take part in the post-Kyoto talks. At the annual UN conferences, the US forced a ※twin-track§ process, taking part in only the meetings it agreed with.Bush also took pains to undermine the UN from the outside. He set up US-led alternative meetings for the governments of big economies, including the Major Economies Forum, and withheld approval to address global warming in existing international groupings, such as the G8 and the G20.The expectation was that, with the US doing its best to undermine it, the UN climate process 每 and with it any prospect of a legally binding obligation on developed countries to cut their emissions - would flop. This was a terrible miscalculation.Every tactic tried by Bush failed. The Major Economies Forum turned into an instrument for forcing US action; the G8 leaders, led by Angela Merkel, rounded on Bush and forced him to sign up to their climate pledge; the UN carried on negotiations while ignoring Washington.The ultimate humiliation came at the UN conference in Bali at the end of 2007. Having held out for two weeks against allowing work to begin on a post-Kyoto agreement, the  Finally, in the sweaty tropical heat of the conference floor, the representative from Papua New Guinea shouted an impassioned ultimatum, to roars and cheers from the assembled nations: ※If you＊re not willing to lead, get out of the way!§ Deserted by every ally, Bush＊s chief diplomat could stand it no longer. The US conceded; the gavel came down; the process that would eventually lead to the Paris agreement was at last begun. Bush＊s humiliation at the hands of one of the world＊s smallest nations was total.Since then, the forces arrayed against US intransigence have multiplied. China for many years held out against any suggestion it should take on national targets to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. But at Paris, the Beijing government marked a major change, . This commitment came only after China had begun to realign its economy to a cleaner, greener footing. Having staked its prestige, Beijing will not turn back.For the Chinese, and other big developing nations from India to Brazil, Mexico to South Korea, the Trump administration＊s attitude offers an irresistible opportunity. They can now claim the moral high ground, having signed up in good faith to make Paris a success, reducing their own emissions and investing in modern technology. They, not the US, have influence to gain here, by offering help to poorer developing nations, the worst affected by climate change. China and other big countries are no longer as dependent on the US economy as they once were 每 the financial crisis saw to that.Bush＊s core mistake 每 about to be repeated by Trump 每 was to imagine the UN process was weak. The apparently ramshackle nature of the negotiations, in which every country, however tiny, has an equal say with the biggest economies, turned out to be its greatest strength. Doomsayers have confidently predicted the imminent demise of the 20-plus-year talks from the outset, yet somehow the process 每 never perfect, never adequate to the challenge 每 still emerges as a hopeful example of what global collective action can achieve. Never more so than at  of the first global legally binding commitment to prevent warming breaching the 2C limit.Though Trump will not succeed in killing Paris, no one should under-estimate the damage he can do. US emissions are the world＊s second highest, and under Trump they could rise again to add to the risk that warming will breach 2C. Already, the world＊s poorest are suffering drought, floods, famine, and the inundation of low-lying coastal areas. Europe＊s southern regions face increasing drought while floods hit the north. In the US, water shortages afflict crop-growing areas and wildfires threaten cities. The rest of the world will have to work harder to make up for US＊s refusal to face reality.Inside that last chilly UN meeting of the Bush administration, in 2008, with Obama already voted in as president-elect, the representatives of the lame-duck White House were asked in the closing press conference if they had any regrets. Harlan Watson, Bush＊s envoy, took the microphone. ※Yes,§ he said. ※I wish I was a little bit taller, and a lot more handsome.§Eight years of trying to block global action on the biggest environmental threat to the planet, reduced to a feeble joke. This time, the stakes are too high for White House mockery. The world can stop Trump from making a farce out of a tragedy."																																																			
" could waste as much as half a trillion dollars on unnecessary new coal-fired power stations, a climate campaign group has said, arguing that the world＊s top carbon polluter already has more than enough such facilities.China＊s rise to become the world＊s second largest economy was largely powered by cheap, dirty coal. But as growth slows, the country has had a difficult time weaning itself off the fuel, even as the pollution it causes wreaks havoc on the environment and public health.Many of China＊s giant state-owned coal mining firms are unviable and plagued by overcapacity, but the ruling Communist party is reluctant to turn off the financial taps and risk widespread unemployment, with its potential for anger and unrest. As of July, China already had 895 gigawatt in coal-fired power stations 每 representing more than half its electricity generation 每 said the London-based Carbon Tracker Initiative, .The country was operating the coal units at less than half their capacity, the campaign group said on Monday, but ※perversely§ had another 205GW already under construction and plans for an additional 405GW.At an estimated $800m per kW, that could cost $490bn in total, CTI said.※This misallocation of capital is a microcosm of wider structural woes within the Chinese economy,§ it said in .Power demand growth had slowed from 10% to 3% or less per year, it added.Even if power consumption grew at 5% a year until 2020 and coal-fired stations were run at 45% capacity, it said, existing plants and those currently under construction would be more than enough.※China no longer needs to build any additional coal plants and therefore should act with conviction to contain its coal overcapacity crisis,§ the report said.Beijing has repeatedly pledged to cut overcapacity in several sectors as it seeks to reform the economy to make it more efficient. It set a target of reducing coal production capacity by 250m tonnes this year, which premier Li Keqiang announced last week had been met by the end of October.But even though capacity cuts do not necessarily lead to reductions in production, they have been blamed for rising coal prices, giving stricken producers a new lease of financial life.CTI＊s comments echo statements by the environmental campaign group Greenpeace, which estimated in July that China has up to 300GW of excess coal-fired capacity. Two new coal power plant projects were being begun each week across 10 different provinces,  said.China＊s current five-year plan 每 a blueprint for economic and social development in 2016 to 2020 每 was ※disappointing§ and ※far from ambitious enough§ in tackling coal power overcapacity, Greenpeace has said. has grown in China, leading the government to declare a ※war on pollution§ and vow to reduce the proportion of energy derived from fossil fuels, but critics say efforts have fallen short of expectations."																																																			
"During inauguration day on 20 January, as Donald Trump was adding ※§ to the presidential lexicon, the new administration also took a hammer to official recognition that climate change exists and poses a threat to the US.One of the starkest alterations to the White House＊s website following Trump＊s assumption of office was the scrapping of an entire section on climate change, stuffed with graphs on renewable energy growth and pictures of Barack Obama gazing at shriveling glaciers, to be replaced by a perfunctory page entitled ※§.In the more than 100 days since, the administration has largely opted for a chisel and scalpel approach to refashioning its online content, but the end result is much the same 每 mentions of climate change have been excised, buried or stripped of any importance.Federal government websites are being combed through to apply new verbiage. The state department＊s office of global change, for example, has removed links to the Obama administration＊s 2013  and mention of the latest UN meeting on climate change. Text relating to climate change and greenhouse gases has also been purged.Trump＊s desire to champion the coal industry is reflected in the Department of Energy＊s online pages aimed at educating children. Sentences that point out the harmful health consequences of burning coal and other impacts of fossil fuels have gone.Alterations to the Department of the Interior＊s  weren＊t quite as subtle. A nine-paragraph description of melting glaciers, wildfires and invasive species driven by climate change has been pared down to a single, noncommittal line.And then there＊s the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  to its climate programs by the administration and led by an administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has  basic scientific understanding of climate change.On 28 April,  in as quiet a way possible 每 it was a Friday at 7pm 每 that its website was ※undergoing changes that reflect the agency＊s new direction§ under Trump and Pruitt. This would involve ※updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership§.Immediately, the EPA＊s climate change section disappeared, to be replaced by a . This page linked to a ※§ from 19 January that includes copious information on the basics of climate change, the amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the US, temperature data and how the EPA is helping tamp down emissions. These changes have caused deep alarm among environmental groups and some scientists, who fear that tweaked online language may soon morph into reams of climate data being deleted. While the  of the EPA and other agencies demand that data is retained, there is little to stop the administration hiding it from public view, only to be obtained via freedom of information laws.Groups such as  and the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative () have swung into action to monitor and archive climate and other data, just in case. EDGI uses a team of volunteer analysts to track changes to around 25,000 pages across multiple government agencies. Maya Anjur-Dietrich, member of EDGI＊s website tracking committee, said the initiative has ※observed several emerging patterns, which notably concern climate change and renewable energy§. ※Across multiple agency websites, we have seen a reduction in usage of terms like ＆climate change＊ and ＆greenhouse gases＊, and an overall reduction in access to information pertaining to climate change,§ she said. ※In a few cases, we have also observed shifts in economy- and business-oriented language, where the descriptions of the office focuses have increased their mentions of helping to grow infrastructure, create jobs, and stimulate the economy.  ※On certain DOE (Department of Energy) pages, in particular, we have seen a shift in emphasis away from renewable energy and, in some cases, towards usage of fossil fuels.§ Anjur-Dietrich pointed out that federal government websites have always been regularly updated, either during an administration or its transition. But unless care is taken, broad, important themes such as climate change can become obscured.  ※It is when web pages are changed without transparency, explanation, or careful documentation that the public＊s access to information 每 and thus the ability to understand the implications of that information 每 is imperiled,§ she said. Activists have sought to resurrect removed information through the so-called Beetlejuice provision, which is where three separate freedom of information requests for the same thing requires the content to be publicly displayed. The Beetlejuice tactic has been used on a range of agencies 每 including Nasa and the EPA 每 for climate data, renewable energy information and other content. Researchers fret that changes to online generalities aimed at the public may ultimately grow to become threat to their work. ※It＊s a serious concern that we will lose this information because long-term, large-scale environmental data is very hard to come by,§ said Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at Duke University who submitted one of the freedom of information requests. ※At this stage it＊s a fear 每 I haven＊t had colleagues saying they tried to get data and it＊s no longer there. But this has to be viewed in the context of an administration that＊s very hostile to science. I mean, we have a president who has said climate change is a Chinese plot.§Amy Atwood, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, added: ※Scrubbing information about climate change will not make it any less dangerous.※We＊re going to fight the Trump administration＊s efforts to bury the science showing the dangerous impacts of climate change at every turn.§"																																																			
"n 1967, my father took me and eight of my brothers and sisters on a whitewater trip down the Colorado River through Grand Canyon National Park. We camped on its massive sandbars, swam in its silty waters and explored the ancient geology of this iconic American landscape. He wanted us to experience the river and to understand the benefits that stem from our nation＊s commitment to protecting its inspiring natural treasures.I had these ideas in mind when I took my own daughter, Kick, down the Grand Canyon 40 years later, in 2007. We joined my old friend, the great anthropologist Wade Davis, and his daughter Tara. Davis was working on a book, and the four of us were guests of Imax cinematographer Greg MacGillivray, who released his film about our journey, Grand Canyon Adventure: River At Risk, in 2008.The trip, book and film focused on the myopic water management policies that led to the construction of the two giant dams that bookend the Grand Canyon 每 Glen Canyon Dam and Hoover Dam 每 and the environmental devastation they＊ve wrought.We weren＊t aware, at that time, of another insidious threat facing the Canyon＊s fragile ecosystems and the people who depend on them: uranium mining. As rock climbing phenom Alex Honnold pointed out here  last May in a bold call to protect our public lands, the Grand Canyon is at once grappling with contamination from past mining and threatened by proposed new mining.Uranium＊s boom-and-bust history has left hundreds of abandoned mines leaching toxic contaminants into this desert region＊s vital water sources. In 2010, the US Geological Survey found that  within the Grand Canyon＊s watershed had dangerous levels of uranium ※related to mining processes§.The National Park Service warns hikers passing Horn Creek, within Grand Canyon National Park, , still poisoned by a mine that closed in 1969. Desert animals find life-sustaining moisture in collecting ponds where uranium concentrations can be  than safe drinking water standards.On nearby Navajo lands, abandoned uranium mines have left a lethal legacy of cancer and disease among Navajo former mine workers and their families. New Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) research shows Tens of millions of Americans downstream depend on the Colorado River for drinking water and crop irrigation, yet government regulators in the thrall of powerful mining companies allow uranium extraction to continue at sites near the Grand Canyon. The Canyon Mine, six miles from the South Rim, sits above an aquifer that provides  to the 700-member Havasupai Tribe.Recent surges in uranium prices prompted a rapid rise in mining claims, from about 1,000 a year in 2005 to more than 8,000 in 2009. Concerned about the impacts of a new uranium boom on this priceless American landscape, President Obama, in 2012, imposed a  on new mining activity on more than one million acres of public land adjoining Grand Canyon National Park.The National Mining Association (NMA), whose membership includes many foreign companies, responded by suing to overturn the ban. , despite the real national security peril; this misguided litigation could allow potentially hostile foreign nations to mine nuclear material from lands owned by the American public.It is time to make President Obama＊s temporary ban permanent. Last fall, Arizona Congressman Ra迆l Grijalva and southwestern tribal leaders collaborated on a bill that would do just that.  would establish a new national monument on 1.7m acres of public land surrounding Grand Canyon National Park. On 20 September this year, in a show of growing political will, US Representative Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona joined Grijalva as the bill＊s cosponsor.Monument status would end future uranium mining, protect grazing and recreational access, defend old-growth ponderosa pine forests and critical wildlife corridors, safeguard the human rights and cultural heritage of tribal peoples and augment the staggering economic contributions made by the nearly 6 million visitors who come to marvel at Grand Canyon National Park and its astonishing surroundings every year.The sensible piece of legislation has virtually no chance of consideration in our polarized Congress, but  shows broad support among likely American voters: 82% back monument establishment and 93% feel that the Grand Canyon is a national treasure for all Americans, not just people who live nearby. As labor and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta , more than half a million people have submitted comments in support of Grand Canyon protection, and many organizations have endorsed the proposed monument.President Obama, who has made conservation and climate change mitigation cornerstones of his presidency, should honor that public will by employing the Antiquities Act to establish the monument.Threats to the Grand Canyon abound. Those sandbars I camped on with my family in 1967? They are gone. Three of the Grand Canyon＊s  Glen Canyon and Hoover Dams have ended the Colorado River＊s natural flush of sediment, which has backfilled and drastically reduced the storage capacity of Lakes Powell and Mead, a situation exacerbated by climate change. At the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado Rivers, as well as at the South Rim town of Tusayan, greedy commercial developers continue to push destructive projects.My father taught my siblings and me that these majestic landscapes, and the shared values of our constitutional democracy, were the common ground where Americans of diverse races, colors, cultures and religions became molded into a single nation. Historian Frederick Jackson Turner pointed out that our values and landscapes were intertwined; American democracy, he observed, emerged from the wilderness experience.President Obama remains in office until 19 January, 2017. He should be commended for already protecting more than 4m acres of land. For all of our daughters and sons, we must now prevail upon him to protect the Grand Canyon before we lose this historic chance."																																																			
"※Like a drop of water in a bucket, on its own is small, but if there are many, many drops, soon it is overflowing.§Erietera Aram＊s water analogy is apposite. His country faces being lost under the waves of the Pacific Ocean.The i-Kiribati man is in Australia delivering his message about the reality of climate change in his country, and of its immediacy. Each discussion, he says, is like a drop of water, adding to the one before it, slowly building understanding of the existential threat to his people and place.※Climate change is not something off in the future, it＊s not a problem for later. We are living it now,§ he says.The archipelago of  每 33 tiny coral atolls spanning 3.5m square kilometres of ocean 每 is the world＊s lowest-lying country, with an average height above sea level of just two metres.Most of the 113,000 i-Kiribati live crammed on to Tarawa, the administrative centre, a chain of islets that curve in a horseshoe shape around a lagoon.※My place is very small,§ Aram says. ※If you stand in the middle, you can see water on both sides. We are vulnerable. One tsunami, one tsunami and our whole country will disappear.§Already, there is less and less of Kiribati for its inhabitants. The coastline is regularly being lost to king tides and to creeping sea levels, and in a very real sense, there is nowhere to go.The loss of land is causing conflict 每 Tarawa is growing ever more densely crowded, as families living on the coastline are forced inwards, infringing on another＊s claim.The next round of multinational climate talks in November 每 COP 23 每 will be chaired by Fiji, and is expected to swing particular focus of the global climate debate to the Pacific, where comparatively minuscule amounts of carbon are produced, but the effects of climate change have been felt first, and most acutely.Assuming the COP presidency, the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, said he would ※bring a particular perspective to these negotiations on behalf of some of those who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change 每 Pacific Islanders and the residents of other small island developing states and low-lying areas of the world§.But the islands＊ fight to be saved was everybody＊s, Bainimarama said.※Our concerns are the concerns of the entire world, given the scale of this crisis.§Aram and compatriots from Kiribati and fellow low-lying islanders from  are travelling with the Edmund Rice Centre, a social justice group, across Australia.

"The number of wild animals living on Earth is set to fall by two-thirds by 2020, according to a , part of a mass extinction that is destroying the natural world upon which humanity depends.The analysis, the most comprehensive to date, indicates that animal populations plummeted by 58% between 1970 and 2012, with losses on track to reach 67% by 2020. Researchers from WWF and the Zoological Society of London compiled the report from scientific data and found that the destruction of wild habitats, hunting and pollution were to blame.The creatures being lost range from mountains to forests to rivers and the seas and include well-known endangered species such as elephants and gorillas and lesser known creatures such as vultures and salamanders.The collapse of wildlife is, with climate change, the most striking sign of the  in which humans dominate the planet. ※We are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,§ said Prof Johan Rockstr?m, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, in a foreword for the report.Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF, said: ※The richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse.§ He said humanity was completely dependent on nature for clean air and water, food and materials, as well as inspiration and happiness.The report analysed the changing abundance of more than 14,000 monitored populations of the 3,700 vertebrate species for which good data is available. This produced a measure akin to a stock market index that indicates the state of the world＊s 64,000 animal species and is  to measure the progress of conservation efforts.The biggest cause of tumbling animal numbers is the destruction of wild areas for farming and logging: the majority of the Earth＊s land area has now been impacted by humans, with just 15% protected for nature. Poaching and exploitation for food is another major factor, due to unsustainable fishing and hunting: more than , according to recent research.Pollution is also a significant problem with, for example, killer whales and dolphins in European seas being . Vultures in south-east Asia have been , dying after eating the carcasses of cattle dosed with an anti-inflammatory drug. Amphibians have suffered one of the  thought to be spread around the world by the trade in frogs and newts. Rivers and lakes are the hardest hit habitats, with animals populations down by 81% since 1970, due to excessive water extraction, pollution and dams. All the pressures are magnified by global warming, which shifts the ranges in which animals are able to live, said WWF＊s director of science, Mike Barrett.Some researchers have reservations about the report＊s approach, which summarises many different studies into a headline number. ※It is broadly right, but the whole is less than the sum of the parts,§ said Prof Stuart Pimm, at Duke University in the US, adding that looking at particular groups, such as birds, is more precise.The report warns that losses of wildlife will impact on people and could even provoke conflicts: ※Increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon, increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources.§However, some species are starting to recover, suggesting swift action could tackle the crisis.  are thought to be increasing and the  from the list of endangered species. In Europe, protection of the habitat of the Eurasian lynx and controls on hunting have seen its population rise fivefold since the 1960s. A recent global wildlife summit also introduced new protection for , the world＊s most trafficked mammals, and , the most trafficked wild product of all.But stemming the overall losses of animals and habitats requires systemic change in how society consumes resources, said Barrett. People can choose to eat less meat, which is often fed on grain grown on deforested land, and businesses should ensure their supply chains, such as for timber, are sustainable, he said. ※You＊d like to think that was a no-brainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable, then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business,§ Barrett said. Politicians must also ensure all their policies - not just environmental ones - are sustainable, he added.※The report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are,§ said Barrett. ※My hope though is that we don＊t throw our hands up in despair - there is no time for despair, we have to crack on and act. I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene, but the will has to be there to do it.§"

", the new chair of the Arctic council, has appealed to climate change scientists to fight the threat of the US and Russia tearing up commitments to combat global warming.The Nordic country takes up the two-year chairmanship of the body, increasingly a forum where arguments about climate change play out, at a ministerial meeting on Thursday in Fairbanks, Alaska, where the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, will represent the .The meeting is due to set targets to reduce black carbon in the Arctic, a pollutant that traps atmospheric heat, but comes amid fears the US is poised to downgrade its commitments made at the .Harri M?ki-Reinikka, the Finnish ambassador for northern policies, called for the Paris treaty to be respected. ※We hope there will be no deals over the heads of others 每 these are very global issues. Arctic conditions are changing. If the temperatures are two degrees higher globally that can be four degrees higher, or even six degrees in the ,§ he said.※What is even more worrying is that ice and snow are melting faster than we estimated, and that will change the composition of the waters and even the sea level might be rising. If we have two countries,  and the US, not sharing the view that climate change is happening or is manmade or how much it is manmade, it is very difficult to proceed.§M?ki-Reinikka said ※a month ago Putin said climate change is not man made§ but recent reports of bubbles of methane gas forming in Siberia, potentially putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, could mean ※a vicious circle of climate change and global warming will be faster, and the Paris climate change agreements will need to be stronger§.Russian scientists have mapped out 7,000 dirt-covered mounds in Siberia, which have mysteriously taken shape in the otherwise flat tundra landscape. Some are slowly filling up with pressurised carbon dioxide and methane, with some on the verge of exploding.Efforts are under way by some British climate experts to persuade senior Russian scientists to think again about climate change.A debate is still raging within the US administration about whether Donald Trump should stick to his campaign commitment to abandon the Paris treaty.Another member of the Arctic council, Norway, has also been putting pressure on Trump with its environment minister, Vidar Helgesen, this week saying that climate change was now seen by military planners as a serious international security challenge. There are eight member states on the council and about $400bn (?310bn) is being invested in the region, with the majority of that sum from Russia."

"Oil rigs poised to begin drilling in the Great Australian Bight could use faulty equipment that US regulators say is very likely to cause a ※§ like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.With no assurances the faulty equipment can be avoided in the Bight drilling, and safety plans that probably rely on faulty equipment already approved, parliamentarians and conservationists are calling for any approvals of BP＊s pending environmental plans to be halted, and its exploration licences to be suspended, until the problem has been solved.The Great Australian Bight is a virtually pristine unique ecosystem, bounded by the world＊s longest southern-facing coastline. Much of it, including the region  proposes to drill, was included in Australia＊s commonwealth marine reserve network. The federal government concluded it was a ※globally important seasonal calving habitat for the threatened southern right whale§.It is also a crucial foraging area for threatened Australian sea lions, threatened white sharks, tuna and migratory sperm whales. A government-commissioned  found it was of ※international significance for ecologists and conservationists§.Around the world  enormous bolts that secure offshore oil equipment to the seafloor have been snapping in half or coming loose, with US regulators describing the problem as a ※§ and working with industry to replace more than 10,000 of the bolts in US waters.But in Australia, where regulators appear set to approve BP＊s  每 key parts of which are not available to the public 每 to drill in the middle of a commonwealth marine reserve, the regulator couldn＊t point to any action it had taken to protect against potentially massive underwater oil spills caused by the bolt failures.BP Australia refused to answer specific questions put to the company about the bolt failures, referring Guardian Australia instead to Diamond Offshore.Diamond Offshore did not respond to emails or phone messages.A spokeswoman for the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema), which regulates offshore oil and gas operations in Australia, told the Guardian the only action it had taken in relation to the issue was more than three years ago, when it requested operators to reveal whether they were using a particular batch of bolts from one manufacturer.That appeared to be the minimum possible course of action Nopsema could take, since those particular bolts produced by GE had been . But the problem has affected three different types of bolts from three different manufacturers, suggesting the issue was industry-wideor ※systemic,§ according to US regulators.Tony Burke, Labor shadow minister for environment and water, was environment minister when the marine reserve in the Great Australian Bight was established. He said: ※The more I look at this application, it is fast looking like a project and a process without precedent. It would be extraordinary if there is new and relevant information from the United States, for the Australian government to issue an approval without considering it.§Nick Xenophon, senator for  and leader of NXT, said he and his team would be pushing for this issue to be examined in a Senate inquiry, and called for the assessment processes to be halted until it had time to examine the issue.※The environmental plan is obviously predicated on certain safeguards being in place. If there are allegations of systemic problems with the bolts then the whole process must be on hold until the any risks form these bolts are assessed,§ Xenophon told the Guardian.※The problem here is even if the risk is minuscule, the consequences are catastrophic,§ he said.The Greens South Australian senator, Sarah Hanson-Young, said: ※The fact that BP won＊t rule out the use of these dangerous, substandard bolts is concerning. The entire process has been so secretive and opaque from the beginning that even basic information like this has been impossible to come by.§※Clearly we need to get to the bottom of what exactly is going on here and whether these questionable bolts will be used,§ she said.The Wilderness Society＊s national director, Lyndon Schneiders, said: ※It＊s now time the Australian Government acts and stops any new offshore oil drilling activities, including using its powers to suspend BP＊s exploration permits in the Great Australian Bight.§.BP has outsourced its drilling in the Great Australian Bight to Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc, which in the US has  and is working to replace many of them.In January Brian Salerno, the director of the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), , saying: ※The fact that these failures involved equipment from the three primary manufacturers of this equipment suggests that this is a systematic industry problem that requires immediate attention.§The peak body for the oil and gas industry, APPEA, sent the Guardian a statement, suggesting the only action the industry had taken was to respond to Nopsema＊s query about the one batch of bolts that were subject to a global recall. ※No operators reported using the batch in question,§ it said.Despite the US industry taking considerably more action than is apparent in Australia, the US regulator said even that wasn＊t enough. ※I am concerned that the industry is not moving quickly enough given the potential for a catastrophic failure,§ Salerno said.While the industry has moved to replace thousands of bolts in the US, Nopsema wasn＊t aware of any bolt replacements in Australia.A spokeswoman for Nopsema told the Guardian that it had a ※non-prescriptive§ regime, where the regulator relied on the operator to produce a ※safety case§ that ensured that risks were reduced to a level that was ※as low as reasonably practicable§.It was understood BP＊s contractor, Diamond Offshore, had received approval from Nopsema for its safety case, despite nobody knowing what exactly the causes of the bolt failures were or whether any bolts were free of the faults.Some of the bolt failures have occurred in ※blow-out preventers§, the failure of which was responsible for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico 每 the largest oil spill in history, also at a BP well.In July Salerno wrote about the bolt failures, saying: ※That we have not had a major incident so far may be due to luck more than anything else. How long that luck will last is not a question I think any of us is comfortable answering.§But unable to discover the root cause of the failures, the US regulator has convened a massive , involving 17 agency partners, including Nasa, to investigate the matter.In August,  in an interagency meeting about bolt failures: ※We know we have a problem, and suspect it may be a more widespread problem.§Other officials in the agency have warned a bolt failure could lead to a catastrophe on the scale of BP＊s Deepwater Horizon spill, which killed 11 workers and released millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.BP has not released its oil-spill modelling for its operations in the Great Australian Bight, but independent modelling commissioned by the Wilderness Society has shown even a relatively small ※low-flow§ oil spill from one of BP＊s wells in the Bight , as well as Tasmania.That would affect a large fishing and tourism industry in the region, as well the globally significant ecosystems.BP has already had its environmental plans  but the documentshave not been released, so the reasons for rejection are unknown.Nopsema usually only allows environmental plans to be resubmitted twice but BP has split its application into two separate proposals, potentially resetting the counter.Schneiders said the US regulator had made it clear the subsea bolt problem could cause a repeat of BP＊s Gulf of Mexico oil disaster and was working with industry to fix the problem but Nopsema had done nothing."																																																			
"Conservationists have called for a moratorium on logging more than 100,000 hectares of Victoria＊s remaining native forest estate to protect the critically endangered Leadbeater＊s possum.Environmental Justice Australia, acting on behalf of volunteer organisation , wrote to the Victorian environment minister, Lily D＊Ambrosio, on Monday requesting she implement an interim conservation order to ※completely prohibit logging within the critical habitat of the Leadbeater＊s possum§ in order to ensure the survival of the species, which is at risk of dying out within the next 40 years.The critical habitat area is made up of 171,345 hectares of mountain ash forest in central , according to recent research.According to lawyer Danya Jacobs, about 101,400 hectares of that habitat is currently available for logging. The proposal would see state-owned logging corporation VicForests lose access to almost a quarter of its remaining 490,000-hectare native production forests, leaving it unable to meet already reduced logging quotas.The majority of Victoria＊s native forest logging reserves are in the mountain ash forests of central Victoria and Gippsland, an area that overlaps with Leadbeater＊s possum habitat.In a letter provided to Guardian Australia, Jacobs argues that existing protections in place for the species are ※inadequate and not working§ and that the possum was at ※very high risk of extinction if additional areas of its habitat are not protected§.※An (interim conservation order) that completely prohibits logging within the critical habitat of Leadbeater＊s possum would be entirely reasonable and appropriate given the status of the species, the outdated and inadequate nature of its current protections under Victorian law, the new scientific information and recommendations,§ she wrote.The suggested order would prohibit any commercial activities that may disturb, damage or destroy the possum＊s habitat within the critical habitat zone. It would also expand the existing 200-metre buffer zone to 1km around places where possums have been spotted outside that zone, and introduce a 100-metre buffer around all hollow trees.As a compromise, Jacobs wrote, the order could instead require the secretary of the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning to individually approve any logging or commercial activity within those areas.D＊Ambrosio said she had received the letter and would consider it.The effectiveness of the 200-metre buffer zones are currently , with a report due this month. There are more than 400 identified Leadbeater＊s possum colonies within areas controlled by VicForests, all of which have been protected by a 12-hectare special protection zone.In February, D＊Ambrosio halted logging in the Blue Vein coupe in central Victoria after signs of Leadbeater＊s possum habitation were spotted next to the bulldozers.Special protection zones 每 the product of the 200-metre buffer 每 can be implemented even if there have been no positive sightings of the possum in an area that is highly likely to be possum habitat.※The management prescriptions proposed by the environmental group would likely lead to significant difficulties in delivering timber to current contracts and put at risk thousands of jobs across the Victorian timber industry,§ VicForests said.The push to secure more protections for Victoria＊s state faunal emblem comes a month after Australian Sustainable Hardwoods announced it would close its Heyfield saw mill after VicForests reduced its timber allocation, prompting the federal agriculture minister, .Prof David Lindenmayer, the leading expert on Leadbeater＊s possums,  ※if you want to conserve Leadbeater＊s possum, you basically have to protect almost all of the remaining mountain ash forest§."

"Yesterday, New York Times subscribers were treated to an email alert announcing the first opinion column from Bret Stephens, who they hired away from the Wall Street Journal. Like all Journal opinion columnists who write about climate change, Stephens has said a lot of things on the subject . Thus many Times subscribers voiced bewilderment and concern about his hiring, to which . Justifying the critics, here＊s how the paper announced Stephens＊ first opinion column in an email alert (usually reserved for important breaking news):In , Stephens pooh-poohed climate change as a ※modest (0.85 degrees Celsius) warming of the Northern Hemisphere since 1880,§ citing . However, Stephens packed three big mistakes into that single sentence. Here＊s what the IPCC said (emphasis added):The northern hemisphere warms faster than the global average because it has more land and less ocean than the southern hemisphere (water warms slowly), so this is an important mistake that underestimates the global temperature rise. On top of that, since 2012 we＊ve seen the three hottest years on record (2014, 2015, and 2016), so even the 0.85∼C warming figure is outdated (). Most importantly, the global warming we＊ve experience is in no way ※modest.§ We＊re already causing a rate of warming , and within a few decades we could be causing . The last ice age transition saw about 4∼C global warming over 10,000 years; humans are on pace to cause that much warming between 1900 and 2100 每 a period of just 200 years, with most of that warming happening since 1975.Of course, how much global warming we see in the coming decades depends on how much carbon pollution we dump into the atmosphere. If we take serious immediate action to cut those emissions, as the international community pledged to do under , we can limit global warming to perhaps 2∼C, and the climate consequences that come along with it.But this is where Stephens＊ opinions are particularly unhelpful:In other words, the people obstructing climate policies are justified because climate ※advocates§ are too mean to them, and claim too much certainty about the future.This is of course nonsense. There is uncertainty about how much global warming and climate change we＊ll see in the coming decades (climate scientists are crystal clear about this), but the biggest factor contributing to that uncertainty is human behavior 每 how much carbon pollution we end up dumping into the atmosphere. This is apparent from looking at the IPCC global temperature projections:In the red ＆burn lots of fossil fuels＊ (RCP8.5) scenario, we＊ll see a further 3.0每5.5∼C warming between now and 2100. In the blue ＆take immediate serious climate action＊ (RCP2.6) scenario, we＊ll see a further 0.5每1.5∼C global warming by 2100. Those ranges represent uncertainties in the climate modeling, but the difference between them 每 which is based on how much carbon pollution we release 每 is bigger than the uncertainty in each scenario.. Each time we smoke, we increase the odds of developing cancer a little bit more. The future outcome is uncertain 每 we don＊t know exactly if or when the disaster of cancer will hit 每 but we know we＊re making it more likely every time we smoke, and the smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on the cigarettes as quickly as possible. With climate change, each time we add more carbon pollution to the atmosphere, we increase the odds of a climate catastrophe a little bit more. The smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on our burning of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Stephens＊ piece is akin to criticizing doctors and anti-smoking groups for being too mean to the tobacco industry, and for not focusing on the uncertainty about exactly when the chain-smoking patient will develop cancer.So far, . The Paris climate agreement was a major step to remedy that failure, but now the Trump administration is debating whether to withdraw from it, or simply refuse to honor America＊s pledges.

The more common forms have ultraviolet markings on their petals called bee guides, which look like veins filled with iodine and must be as vivid as rope lights to insects. Violets are hermaphrodites anyway, so they don＊t rely on pollinators, which, given the scarcity of bees at this time of year, and their , is just as well.This is the blackthorn winter, that moment at the end of March when a , wild damson and cherry to  and white sweet violets 每 pulses through woods and hedgerows. This marks the becoming time of spring, when fragments of those seasonal signatures 每 wildflowers and birdsong, bumblebees and lambs 每 begin to join into a coherence, or at least the fantasy of one, that feels like spring.I wonder what Clare＊s springs were like, when the populations of birds, insects and wildflowers were so much stronger and seasonal differences more acute. What would he make of this? Violets have a built-in nostalgia, a belonging to something that is only ever new and so always fleeting and longed for. ※Keep love for youth, and violets for the spring,§ . Violets really do gladden the heart and, like love, they need nurturing; Clare for one could not help but follow his instincts as a gardener, to clear the winter debris from around the violets ※And give them room to grow§.

"Simon Jenkins (, 21 July) still doesn＊t understand what HS2 is about. It was perhaps foolish to call the project ※High Speed 2§, so that many people think it＊s about getting from London to points north more quickly. But its main raison d＊那tre is increasing the capacity of the railways. When in the 1960s we ran out of capacity on the roads and built the M1 and M6, people didn＊t see the reason for these as being able to get somewhere by car more quickly: it was understood that the roads were full. True, as with HS2, people didn＊t want the new roads next to their houses. I travel to London fairly regularly on the west coast mainline (WCML). Unlike most passengers, I usually spend most of the journey looking out of the window rather than working or reading. South of Rugby it＊s quite obvious that the line is very busy indeed, and I understand from the railway technical press that during the day there＊s very little spare capacity (extra train paths) available for freight trains, for which there is a demand. Car drivers are aware when roads are full; but?unless the train is late most rail passengers have no idea about the capacity of the line they＊re travelling on.Alternatives to  have been considered 每 reopening the Great Central Line, for instance, but there was a fuss about that as well 每 but it was concluded that the best value for money was to build a new high speed railway, which would also be a high capacity railway, so that existing fast passenger trains could be diverted on to it, creating more capacity for freight and commuter trains on the existing WCML. Do we wish to see ever increasing numbers of HGVs on our roads, or do we have an interest in moving goods around in a more environmentally efficient way? Frank Field is on shaky ground if he thinks it＊s a simple matter to sink railway lines and raise the height of bridges for double-decker trains (, 21 July) without any understanding of the expense of dealing with ground conditions. Having mistakenly banked on a high degree of uniformity, this is one of the reasons why the cost of the Great Western mainline  as the varied soils and rocks alongside the tracks require different techniques to erect stable gantries.Stripped of the costs of new rolling stock, HS2 is not as expensive as might first be assumed. From the outset, it will speed up existing services to Euston by diverting inter-city trains resulting in more capacity via Milton Keynes which has seen a decrease in faster trains over the last few decades. Exclusive to HS2 lines, new wider rolling stock, including comfortable double-decker trains, could have their main London terminus at Old Oak Common, providing a more convenient interchange with Crossrail services to Heathrow and central London. What is missing are plans for any connection with HS1 and the continent.  Frank Field has some very good ideas about improving our rail network, but does he have any idea of the cost and years of disruption that would be caused by making the railways suitable for running double-deck trains? They have been tried in this country. The Southern Region had two four-coach double-decker experimental trains between 1949 and 1971. They were not a great success, and were unpopular with commuters. The top decks were cramped and badly ventilated; and stations stops were prolonged because it took twice as long for passengers to get on and off.As usual, the problem is our railway history. We were the first country to have railways: they were built with the dimensions of stage coaches in mind, with the result that tunnels, bridges and cuttings prevent the use in most of Britain of rail vehicles wider than 9ft or higher than 13ft. Continental railways, which came along a little later, can mostly allow vehicles 14ft high and just over 10ft wide. That small increase in size made all the difference when it came to introducing double-deck trains: plus, of course, the fact that continental platforms tend to be not far above ground level, allowing the use of double-decker coaches with a rather lower ground floor. The irony is that when the last of Britain＊s major mainline railways, the Great Central Railway, was built it was built to the continental loading gauge with the hope that it could eventually be linked to the continental railway system via a Channel tunnel. This visionary project was also designed for high-speed passenger trains but was gradually closed when BR embarked on its programme of closing lines and stations in the 1960s following Dr Beeching＊s report. Improvements to the track and signalling, which would enable more and faster trains on the existing tracks, seems the only feasible option for the existing network. Not surprisingly, the privatised railway companies and the government seem unwilling to undertake such a bold and of course expensive, forward-looking move.

"o say the Egyptian economy, much reliant on tourism, has seen a turbulent time of late, would be a woeful understatement. As you travel along the Red Sea coast from Hurghada, through Safaga, and El Quseir, the litter-strewn landscape of low hills and desert occasionally gives way to tourism developments and scattered international hotels. Their gardens are still maintained and the palm trees watered, but call in for a drink and the bars and pools are emptier than their designers expected. Equally, many hotels were never completed and desert-worn signs featuring smiling couples who will never visit, lend a post-apocalyptic air.The figures speak for themselves. From a high point in October 2010 of almost one and a half million, tourist arrivals in  were a little under 500, 000 in September 2016; a continuation of a slow decline, (punctuated with significant dips in numbers following acts of terrorism). Egypt＊s＊ tourism minister, Yehia Rashed, has his work cut out and is on record as stating the country is now safe for tourists. As a regular visitor, I personally feel safe. The request for a bribe though, from the police officer at the gates of Hurghada＊s new airport, when a fellow traveller didn＊t have their printed flight coupon handy, suggests not all is not quite as it should be.Think of tourism in Egypt, and you＊ll be forgiven for thinking of crowded markets in Cairo, the splendours of Giza and Abu Simbel, but this would be missing a major contribution to the tourism economy. The Red Sea and its treasures are less well known internationally than King Tut＊s mask or the sphinx, yet staff at dive centres in Sharm El Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula will tell you that one famous shipwreck 每 the SS Thistlegorm 每 brings in more foreign income than the pyramids at Giza. In these troubled years, the European-based dive tourism companies have looked to destinations further afield, but the lure of history-rich wrecks, spectacular corals, sunshine and warm water just five hours away keeps the Red Sea firmly in the minds of individual divers. If flights from European airports are returned to previous levels, divers will flock back, perhaps ahead of more mainstream tourists.I can forget much of that for a short while at least. As an underwater photographer and diving journalist I＊m here for the sharks. As our boat heads out of port the captain is confident of good weather and a quicker than average crossing to our isolated destination. I＊m leaving the dusty streets, the taxi drivers and the tourist shops, and we are heading out, into the blue. The next morning, the water is around twenty-six degrees and we＊ve finned back towards the boat from the coral-covered reef wall. We＊ve used most of our gas and the plan is to spend the last few minutes of the dive hanging a few metres below the surface, hoping for shark activity. A fellow diver points towards a two-metre shark, cruising past at a leisurely pace, a few pilot fish ahead of its sleek snout, and as I take a series of photos I rise a few metres closer to the surface, much to the understandable annoyance of the dive guide, before correcting my buoyancy. The long, lobed pectoral fins, each tipped with bright white identify it as the ocean-wandering oceanic whitetip, a supreme and graceful predator that was once perhaps the most widespread large animal on the planet, before sharks became so threatened.The fish are deeply curious and use a combination of senses, from their chemosensory ability (not entirely smell, but sort of) to an electrosensory ability, that has no analogue in mammals, used in close
encounters. Oceanics (as they＊re often referred to) will come very close, making them a favourite with divers. Just as we realise there are several fish in the water, ranging from small males to a large pregnant female, one young male passes exceptionally close and might have just ※bumped§ me a little to check out the large camera I＊m holding. If I＊m honest, despite my rational brain telling me it＊s not needed, the camera serves as a buffer between me and a fish I know will not attack.As I climb back onto the boat, a fin breaks the surface a few metres away, and while I＊m mindful of the shark＊s abilities, I realise that beyond mild caution, I have not felt real fear at all. I＊ve felt something akin to reverence. These fish that cruise the tropical oceans have shown interest in me; they were curious, aware, and individuals showed unique behaviour, exhibiting preferences in how they cho se to interact.Back on the boat in the lee of the largest of the two El Ikhwa islands (known more commonly as the Brothers) about forty miles from shore, the sharks continue to cruise from boat to boat. I had expected they would shun the noise and commotion of the dive boats and the little rigid-hulled inflatable boats with their noisy outboards, that shuttle divers to and from their entry and exit points. On the contrary, oceanics are attracted to the boats, their noise and chemical signatures and trails in the water. Unlike deeper dwelling sharks like hammerheads, oceanics will scout for food close to the surface and may take mammalian carrion as well as injured fish floundering on the surface, which brings me to the controversial subject of .Sharks are wary, shy animals that in nearly every case will stay away from humans. We are not on their menu, nor do sharks consider us food, but on rare occasions our behaviour and exceptional environmental circumstances can combine and lead to tragedy. In , and a few days later, a woman was killed. The authorities responded by locating and culling several sharks and suspending all water sports activities. Several shark experts commented on just how unusual this event was, not only are sharks rarely seen near beaches, but shark attacks on humans are exceptionally rare. Globally, unprovoked attacks from all sharks, number in the single digits, year on year. It has been suggested that unusually high water temperatures, local overfishing and even the illegal dumping of animal carcasses at sea all contributed to the attack, disrupting behaviour in one lone individual. On the other hand, images have surfaced of snorkelers and swimmers reaching out towards a passing oceanic, almost touching it. Although these fish are not mindless predators, they are not pets to be approached without caution, where they may feel threatened.Dive guides and operators at the Brothers and other shark hotspots, aware of the damage that could be done to the industry, 每 not to mention the sharks themselves 每 if a cull was advocated following an incident, do not allow swimming and snorkelling and are keen to encourage divers to leave the water swiftly and with minimum fuss. Hence my frustration at unnecessarily breaking the water＊s surface earlier. No one wants to see another negative encounter; the Egyptian economy cannot afford to have beaches or dive sites closed and researchers and conservationists would strongly argue against a knee-jerk cull. Many argue the response in 2010 was, at best, pointless.In recent months, in fact just before I swam with the sharks at the Brothers, some disturbing images were circulated online and posted on the Facebook page of the Hurghada Environmental Protection and  Association (HEPCA). These images showed oceanics that had been killed and dumped on the reef adjacent to Big Brother island, with their fins intact. Shark-fishing for any purpose including finning, is banned in these waters, and HEPCA, a non-profit organisation, has stated it will work to identify the culprits who illegally killed the fish.Clearly self-defeating for a country desperate for tourist income, the loss of sharks is indicative of a nation that has yet to come to terms with the competing demands of mass low-budget tourism and a tourism sector dependent upon a thriving ecosystem. Oceanics, once common, are now classed as vulnerable by . Recently, for example, footage has emerged of lorries dumping sand on top of reefs to create beaches for hotel development. Research from HEPCA suggests that a single shark can be worth $200,000 (USD) to the economy annually. A staggering sum, given that oceanics can live up to forty years. Whilst this might be unpleasant to many, including myself, who regard sharks as intrinsically valuable and important players in the reef ecosystem, we seem to be locked into a situation where the only way to preserve sharks is to see them as demonstrably more valuable alive than dead. If that value comes with a dollar sign, then with sadness I say: so be it."																																																			
"The extent of  ice has fallen to a new wintertime low, as climate change drives freakishly high temperatures in the polar regions.The ice cap grows during the winter months and usually reaches its maximum in early March. But the 2017 maximum was 14.4m sq km, lower than any year in the 38-year satellite record, according to researchers at the US  (NSIDC) and Nasa. ※I have been looking at Arctic weather patterns for 35 years and have never seen anything close to what we＊ve experienced these past two winters,§ said NSIDC＊s director, Mark Serreze. 2017 is the third year in a row the Arctic＊s winter ice has set a new low. The new record comes a day after the UN＊s World Meteorological Organisation warned that the record-breaking heat that made  has continued into 2017, . The dramatic melting of  is  that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America, Europe and Asia, according to emerging research.The extreme low in winter Arctic ice follows a very warm autumn and winter, the NSIDC scientists said, with air temperatures 2.5C above average across the Arctic Ocean. Temperatures have soared even higher in places, creating polar ※heatwaves§. Data from the European Space Agency＊s CryoSat-2 satellite also shows that this winter＊s ice cover was slightly thinner than over the past four years. ※Thin ice and beset by warm weather 每 not a good way to begin the melt season,§ said NSIDC＊s lead scientist, Ted Scambos. Prof Julienne Stroeve, at University College London, said: ※Such thin ice going into the melt season sets us up for the possibility of record low sea-ice conditions this September.§ The Arctic ice cap fell to its , just ahead of the lowest ever mark set in 2012. ※The long-term decline is a clear indicator of climate change,§ said Nasa scientist Walt Meier.A record low has also been set in the southern hemisphere, currently in the summer season, where Antarctic sea ice fell to it lowest extent on 3 March, at 2.1m sq km 每 the lowest in the satellite record. However, scientists caution that Antarctic ice extent is highly variable from year to year.Rod Downie, WWF＊s polar programme manager, said: ※The annual freeze and thaw of sea ice in the polar regions is like the beating heart of our planet, driving ocean circulation and regulating our climate. But sea ice is in decline in a warming world and the records have been shattered this year.※We need to act now to lower our carbon emissions by improving energy efficiency, switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy and tackling climate change head on,§ he said."																																																			
"ill Booth struggles to recall the last time he saw a raccoon, a fox or a rabbit on one of his frequent hunting excursions deep into the swamps of the  Everglades. An outdoorsman all his life, he knows as well as anyone how the native wildlife once abundant across the vast wilderness has been all but wiped out by an invasion of a deadly species he is trying his hardest to remove: the Burmese python.By some estimates, up to 150,000 of the unwelcome intruders are swimming through the state＊s 1.5m acres (600,000 hectares) of waterways, reproducing uncontrollably and consuming almost every living creature in their path, sometimes taking on even the previously undisputed king of the Everglades, the American alligator.It＊s a growing problem that has led wildlife officials to conceive ever-more colourful attempts to try to eradicate, or at least contain, the giant snakes. With varying success, efforts have included training dedicated sniffer dogs, bringing in  from India＊s mountain-dwelling Irula tribe, and, most recently,  on a two-month contract for a hunt beginning in April.Booth, who takes his small crew on regular hunts into the most remote parts of the ecologically fragile wetlands, is at the forefront of another initiative. The Miami-born firefighter and his fellow ※Cypress Boys§ are the current champions of the Python Challenge, a month-long hunt devised by the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC) in which members of the public are encouraged to venture into the Everglades, tracking and capturing as many snakes as they can.But while Booth nabbed 33 of the 106 pythons landed in the 2016 challenge, including a 15-footer just 3ft short of the  landed in 2013, he acknowledges the tally had little to no impact on the wider problem.※There＊s no way humanly possible to go out there and catch them and get rid of them altogether,§ he said. ※It＊s just too much of a vast area.※There＊s over a million acres out there, areas down in the national park that humans have hardly ever been to, areas that are off-limits, and you＊ve got snakes everywhere. When I was a little kid, the Everglades was my backyard and I appreciated all the wildlife, but over the years these pythons have taken over and taken a toll on native wildlife. Now you barely see any other wildlife, there＊s hardly any birds and you don＊t see any raccoons. In four years of hunting pretty regularly down there, we might have seen a couple of river otters, but other than that there＊s nothing there.§From the figures, at least, there＊s no shortage of would-be snake hunters willing to risk the dangers of tussling with one of nature＊s most fearsome predators. More than 1,000 participants from 29 states contested last year＊s challenge. Separately, a similar number applied for the 25 paid slots on next month＊s hunt, the overwhelming response forcing an early close to the South Florida water management district＊s application process.※It＊s a thrill, it really is,§ Booth says of catching pythons. ※You might go for days without seeing one, and when you do it＊s unexplainable, you just get goosebumps. Most of the time we see ＊em out sunning themselves.※I was out with a magazine crew for four days and just couldn＊t find a snake. We were just to the point of giving up and went to a tree island for lunch, I walked around and there it was, a 15-footer.§Florida＊s problem with pythons became apparent in about the middle of the last decade, when officials began to notice steep declines in the populations of native animals and birds. Anecdotally, the snakes first appeared in the 1980s, dumped by owners who could no longer care for their fast-growing exotic pets, or having escaped from an Everglades breeding facility destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992.Skip Snow, a retired biologist with the National Parks Service (NPS), joined forces with FWC, the US Geological Survey and university researchers to create a number of initiatives to try to limit their impact. So-called Judas snakes were released back into the wild with radio transmitters during mating season, designed to lead officials to females each carrying up to 100 eggs. But after some early successes, there were problems with batteries running out and other technological issues.Snow was also credited with the introduction of Python Pete, an enthusiastic beagle puppy who spent several months in training with a captured serpent called Bob to be able to sniff out hiding snakes for a reward of fried liver.Unfortunately, Pete was quickly retired when it became clear he couldn＊t work for more than 15 minutes at a time in Florida＊s scorching heat and humidity, but his trailblazing efforts continue with a joint venture between the NPS, University of Florida and a team from Auburn University＊s dog detection team.Two black labrador retrievers, Floyd and Vito, who were previously trained as bomb-sniffing dogs, found six pythons during a four-month project in the Florida Keys that wrapped up in February. ※They are good at finding them when the snakes are right in front of them and we cannot see them, but there are challenges,§ said Dr Christina Romagosa of UF＊s department of wildlife and ecology, co-author of a startling  that found pythons had almost entirely wiped out native mammals in the Everglades, from marsh rats to bobcats and deer.※It can be simple if the snake is just in front of you in weeds, but if they＊re in a hole or in water, we as people are still challenged in finding them.§The dogs were in Key Largo at the same time as the Indian tribesmen, brought in by FWC as a two-month experiment. They captured four pythons on an abandoned missile site that the labradors had detected but not found.Tylan Dean, chief of the biological services branch of Everglades national park, believes such initiatives are unlikely to make much of a dent in the python population, but says all have some value as part of a ※toolbox§ of options and as educational vehicles.※In terms of control, we still don＊t have any method that I would call successful,§ he said.※I try to be optimistic because I don＊t think we should give up on this wonderful ecosystem or the critters that are being affected 每 it＊s worth continuing to try to improve. There＊s always potential there＊s something out there that will be revolutionary, that could be meaningful in our ability to control pythons or reduce their impact.§"																																																			
"This is going to sound like hyperbole, but it isn＊t. The very worst thing about the ongoing climate change crisis is Cartoon Network＊s decision to make every episode of Captain Planet . If we had all got our act together and managed to sort out this mess, Captain Planet would be an anachronism. We wouldn＊t need to see his stupid blue face, or hear his stupid theme tune, or endure any more of his stupid, too-literal sermonising ever again. But, instead, he will be on Amazon Prime soon. Well done, everybody.My God, Captain Planet was the worst. Of course, you might disagree with this, because you were raised in the 1990s and are gripped by a violent desire to defend everything from that time as unimpeachably perfect. You have a foggy memory of the Captain Planet theme tune and that＊s enough for you, because you are a Kangol-hat-wearing clod . Trust me, I have just been watching episodes of Captain Planet, and it is the worst.First, Captain Planet has not aged well. We like our superheroes gritty now. We like to see all their underlying torment laid out before us like a depressing misery-buffet. Batman has to scowl. Wolverine has to suffer. Even Superman is a city-destroying murderer these days. Captain Planet, meanwhile, is a benevolent dolphin of a thing. He smiles constantly. He dresses like one of ＊s backing dancers. Let him loose into the contemporary superhero scene and he wouldn＊t stand a chance. He would be like a domesticated budgie flying back into the jungle. He would be massacred within seconds.Also 每 and I cannot overstate this enough 每 Captain Planet was useless. His entire modus operandi was to rid the world of pollution, but his only known weakness was 每 you have guessed it 每 pollution. What sort of messed-up situation is that? He＊s scuppered at every turn. It is like putting Superman to work exclusively as a kryptonite distributor. It doesn＊t make any sense. Captain Planet has super strength and the ability to fly. He would be much better served zapping around the world kicking terrorists＊ heads off. But, oh no, go and make yourself ill next to a burst pipeline instead, you tit.No wonder he barely did anything. Captain Planet might genuinely count as history＊s laziest superhero. You will remember that He-Man＊s catchphrase was: ※I have the power.§ Meanwhile, Captain Planet＊s was ※The power is yours§, which he often yelled at kids before buggering off to wherever it is he is supposed to have come from. Nice one, Captain Planet. You are the infinitely powerful superbeing with the ability to effect meaningful change but, no, you＊re right, go and delegate everything to some children instead. As a catchphrase, ※The power is yours§ is basically, ※You do it§ or ※Listen, I would, but I＊ve got a thing.§In fairness, an element of this laziness was probably justified, because Captain Planet＊s enemies were arguably as terrible as he was. Betty Blight was a mad scientist who could control the weather, but was so inept that she needed to take a side-job as a lounge singer to make money. Verminous Skumm was basically a low-level drug dealer. Duke Nukem＊s biggest crime was possibly his taste in shirts. That＊s it. Send literally any other superhero after these no-marks and they would be brought to justice within an hour or two. Captain Planet had 113 episodes, and still managed to create exactly zero permanent solutions. Screw you, Captain Planet. You are an annoying distraction, plus your hair is rubbish.Ostensibly, Captain Planet is being released digitally to coincide with Earth Day. Far be it for me to dictate your behaviour, but you＊d probably be better off commemorating Earth Day by fishing cans out of a lake or something. I know nostalgia is telling you otherwise, but you really shouldn＊t waste your time on this pointless blue oaf."																																																			
																																																			
"A mass bleaching event is taking its toll on the  for an unprecedented second year in a row, a Queensland government agency has confirmed.The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has declared widespread damage from an underwater heatwave after a single day of aerial surveys between Cairns and Townsville on Thursday.The authority＊s David Wachenfeld  the survey findings ※regrettably§ gave the agency enough evidence to declare another mass bleaching event, following the worst to date in 2016 which .A repeat of mass bleaching compounds fears for the survival of already-stressed coral, whose recovery since 2016 has been challenged by stubbornly high sea surface temperatures, including through winter.The scale of bleaching will be confirmed through further surveys by the agency and reef scientists but it is likely to take at least six months before the death rate of coral is known. Wachenfeld said the agency＊s survey added to ※quite a few reports through our early warning system, the eye on the reef program§.While the more remote northern section of the reef was hardest-hit last year, coral bleaching has been recently documented in areas further south more commonly visited by tourists.Photos and footage taken by marine biologist Brett Monroe Garner at a reef between Port Douglas and Cairns indicate severe bleaching of corals he said were ※full of colour and life§ little over a month ago.Garner, who has been documenting the bleaching with Greenpeace, said: ※I＊ve been photographing this area of the reef for several years now and what we＊re seeing is unprecedented.※In these photos nearly 100% of the corals are bleaching and who knows how many will recover? Algae is already beginning to overgrow many of the corals.※Just a few months ago, these corals were full of colour and life. Now, everywhere you look is white. The corals aren＊t getting the chance to bounce back from last year＊s bleaching event. If this is the new normal, we＊re in trouble.§The images, released by Greenpeace on Friday, add to what the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration described last month as  of the reef, from Mackay in the south to the far north.Wachenfeld said the extent of bleaching compared to last year was less important than the fact that ※the climate is changing and that is bringing a much greater frequency of extreme weather events to the Great Barrier Reef§.※In total, those extreme weather events and the overall impact of climate change is a major threat to the future of the reef.§WWF oceans campaigner Richard Leck said he was ※shocked and saddened by what is unfolding§. ※Scientists warned that without sufficient emissions reductions we could expect annual mass bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef by 2050,§ he said. ※Consecutive bleaching events have arrived 30 years early.§WWF also released footage on Monday of severely bleached coral at Vlasoff Cay near Cairns, where cinematographer Richard Fitzpatrick filmed sequences for David Attenborough＊s Great Barrier Reef series.※Vlasoff Cay used to have the best coral diversity in the area,§ Fitzpatrick said.※Now with the water sitting at 32 degrees all the way to the bottom, the corals are dying. Many are already dead and covered in algae.§※The reef is facing an imminent danger of mortality at a level that far exceeds last year over a greater geographical distance.§Pictures of newly bleached coral were taken in recent weeks at Moore Reef, near Cairns, by the reef scientist Tyrone Ridgway, as well as by .The bleaching has prompted Terry Hughes, a leading reef scientist at James Cook University who is also with the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, to embark on a week-long aerial survey of the reef from next Wednesday.The survey will replicate one last year that drew global attention to the extent of damage to the natural wonder.He said indications from underwater thermometers were that although sea surface temperatures were lower than this time last year, they had been above average over the last year, including through winter.Bleaching occurs when warm waters prompt coral to expel algae living within their tissues, turning white.The coral may die in the six to 12 months after bleaching, meaning the level of mortality on the reef will not be determined until later in the year.The world heritage-list reef was spared an ※in danger§ listing by Unesco in 2015 but environmental groups argue it remains on the organisation＊s ※watch list§.The Australian and  governments, which are obliged to show how they are jointly managing the reef＊s long-term conservation, acknowledge climate change is its main threat.The Queensland Labor government, which is focused on improving water quality after its bid to pass tree-clearing laws to curb emissions 每 a key plank of Australia＊s reef conservation plan 每 failed, has urged its federal counterpart to price carbon.However, the federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, at the start of a review of the government＊s climate change policies earlier this year, was forced to rule out pricing carbon after a brief internal revolt. The Greenpeace campaigner Alix Foster Vander Elst said the Australian and Queensland governments should rethink their support of the giant proposed Adani coalmine, given its potential contribution to climate change.※We have on our doorstep the clearest signal that climate change is happening, and that governments aren＊t moving fast enough to stop it,§ Elst said. ※Tackling climate change is the only real solution here and that starts by stopping public funding for climate-killing coal projects.§"																																																			
"n a parched hill in central , a blue tanker winds its way past half-built houses carrying water to Alto Buena Vista, a hillside settlement in the south of the city of Cochabamba. For this particular neighbourhood, trucks like this are the only source of water. But just a couple of valleys away in the community of Maria Auxiliadora, hundreds of households have a steady, piped water connection thanks to a community-run well. The 69-metre well taps into an aquifer and the water is pumped to the top of the hill, from where it is distributed to around 370 households.Cochabamba has a history of water struggles and the tale of these two different approaches to water dates back to 1999 and 2000; the city hit international headlines after protests broke out when its water system was privatised and rates were hiked. The privatisation was overturned, but sixteen years later the city is expanding and the municipal water network has still not reached newer, poorer areas such as Alto Buena Vista, leaving residents dependent on trucked-in water.※We don＊t know where the trucks get the water from, but we still have to drink it,§ says Aurora Colque Gabriel, who built her house in Alto Buena Vista two years ago. One of Cochabamba＊s poorest neighbourhoods, it is developing fast; under temperatures of more than 30 degrees, workmen cobble unpaved roads and dig trenches for gas pipes.The arid barrio has no piped water connections or wells, and it rarely rains here. This means no showers or washing machines. ※Sometimes my children go to school without even washing their faces because of the lack of water,§ says Colque Gabriel.But in Maria Auxilidora, families have water meters and pay for what they use at an office nearby. The well was funded half by a Swiss NGO PAMS-Suiza and half by the community. Each person paid a quota of $60 but as not every lot of land was occupied at the time the water system was being built, the community took out a loan from NGO . Unfortunately, the interest on the loan meant that some people arriving in the community later had to pay more than others. Maria Auxiliadora is one of around 700 neighbourhoods with community water projects in Cochabamba and its surrounding towns, according to Stefano Archidiacono, whose NGO CeVI works with Cochabamba water rights organisation. The size, water quality and reliability of these projects varies, he says, and ※almost no one [in these projects] has support from the government§.※Before the well, it was all water trucks,§ says Juana Aguilar Zeballos who has lived in Maria Auxiliadora, which was set up in 1999 as a co-operative community, for 10 years. ※That was more difficult, especially for the families at the top of the hill. The trucks didn＊t want to drive up.§Getting your water from trucks is an expensive system, currently costing between 30 and 35 bolivianos (roughly ?3 to ?3.50) per 1000 litres. For those using the community well, the price is just two bolivianos per 1000 litres plus 18 bolivianos per month for maintenance. Depending on the size of a family (and how frugal they are with water), one family might only use 1000 litres a month, while others might use 10,000 litres or more. Water from the trucks is also less reliable. Tests by hygiene and sanitation organisation, , show that the water can contain bacterial contamination far in excess of the limit for human consumption. This contamination comes from dirty tanks, the ground, and instruments used to drill the wells, according to Jeremy Maes, the foundation＊s associate director. Those hardest hit by drinking contaminated water are children under the age of five and pregnant women. ※Illness leads to absence from school, and it＊s very difficult for the children to catch up,§ says Maes.Maria Auxiliadora＊s system has been licensed by the Bolivian state as an entity providing water and sewage services, meaning that there is a protected area around the community in which nobody else is allowed to drill. Some locals, though, are still concerned that the protection could be violated. ※One worry is that the water could dry up, or that someone could drill into one of the veins feeding our water pocket and absorb the water,§ says Aguilar Zeballos.If the well dried up, the village would have to revert back to water tanks and wait for the Misicuni dam, currently under construction around 22 miles north-west of Cochabamba. Scheduled for completion next month, the dam will collect water from the mountains surrounding the city. To receive water from Misicuni, Maria Auxiliadora would need connections to Cochabamba＊s municipal system, a process which could take a long time. Managing the water supply locally is not easy; disagreements over who controls the water have created problems in Maria Auxiliadora recently. Nonetheless, the community would not want municipal water provider  to take control of their system, says Aguilar Zeballos. ※When we built it, we were proud. We were the only neighbourhood in our district to have water and sewage.§For Marcela Olivera, the Latin American coordinator for ＊s Water for All campaign, most people view provision of services such as water as a choice between state provision and private enterprise. Community water management represents a third option. ※People don＊t see that there can be another way: community-run,§ she says. ※Maybe large-scale projects are not the solution. Maybe the solution is small.§"

"The former mayor of London＊s response to  was trademark Boris Johnson bluster. To allege there was a cover-up was , he said. Of course he hadn＊t hid the impact of dirty air.But in defending his record on air pollution, he also seemed to make things worse. On Monday we didn＊t know if Johnson himself was personally aware of the findings of the unpublished report that the new mayor Sadiq Khan accuses him of suppressing. There was no denial from Johnson that the report (which was completed in September 2013) had not been published but perhaps it had never been brought to his attention. It is hard to actively suppress a report if you don＊t even know about it.Now we know he did know about it - or at least some of its key findings.On Tuesday, Johnson said there could be no cover-up because he had already made a speech in 2015 about pollution in deprived schools. ※I made the very point about primary schools and poor air quality in areas of deprivation. So as cover-ups go it wasn＊t a particularly brilliant one, considering I made a speech about it,§ he told reporters during a visit to an aluminium plant.In that speech, a lecture to a small crowd at the Sir Simon Milton lecture in June last year, the then-mayor said: ※I can tell you that for London primary schools that have the misfortune to be in areas of poor air quality, 82%, 82% of those  primary schools affected by poor air quality are in areas of economic deprivation.§Set aside the fact that the actual figure is 83% or the fact that it was the schools that were considered deprived rather than the areas. What＊s interesting about this is it tells us Johnson had read the report, or had at least been briefed on its conclusions - and was talking about it nearly two years after it was handed over to City Hall by the authors.But neither he, his office or the former deputy mayor for environment and energy, Matthew Pencharz, can explain why it wasn＊t published. Johnson thought its key finding was striking enough to mention in a speech, and yet the full report was not made public.Pencharz  in response to people outraged at the apparent cover-up that if they listened to Johnson＊s response on Tuesday, they＊d know ※we were aware of [the] problem & [there was] no cover-up.§ But there was no explanation of why the report was not published.There＊s also the question of the delay. If Johnson was so passionate about reducing the brutal inequality of air pollution why did he wait until June 2015 to mention the key finding in a report produced in September 2013?Even the author of the report, the director of the Oxford-based environmental consultancy Aether, says that the GLA under Johnson publicly disclosed some of the report＊s positive conclusions, but held back the negative ones. ※The crux of the report was about understanding the inequalities of air pollution, so they chose not to make public the findings regarding inequality,§ Katie King told the Guardian. ※The information that they did take from the report was the positive, that exposure was predicted to fall in the future.§ (You can now read the full document, titled ).For now, it＊s impossible to say whether Johnson personally intervened to prevent the report＊s publication. But what is clear is that the report＊s findings - that of the 433 primary schools in the capital affected by illegal pollution, 83% were deprived schools - were as politically toxic as the air in question.

"e know that things are bad with bees right now. In the past decade, they have been disappearing at an alarming rate 每 a combination of pests, pesticides and the destruction of habitats has seen the UK population decrease by about a third over that period. In September,  for the first time. The consequences of losing them would be huge: Albert Einstein once said that humans ※§.Help is taking all kinds of forms: from  gigs to experimental  and .When it comes to schools, it would be understandable for the approach to be theoretical rather than practical (anyone who has ever shared a classroom with a bee and a set of panicking students will understand why). But there are schools across the country taking a practical approach and getting involved in beekeeping, rather than just reading about it.Dr Julia Hoggard has kept bees for 30 years and runs a 20-acre, bee-orientated nature reserve in Cumbria. For the past year, she has been working with a local primary school, helping the students to create their own hives.※I remember lots and lots of bees being in hay meadows when I was a child,§ she says. ※Whereas we will have summers now where we don＊t see that many, even on the bee reserve. The change is painfully obvious. ※The advantage of having them in schools is that they are neat little communities; you can look at every single aspect of what is going on and link it into the curriculum at all key stages.§There are the obvious subject links with biology and environmental science 每 studying mini beasts, pollination and sustainability, for example 每 but a hive can also be used to explore elements of history, art, maths and music, as well as providing opportunities for developing practical skills: using woodwork lessons to construct the hive, or making dishes using honey in food technology.Hoggard is quick to address the major concern that comes to most people＊s minds when considering keeping bees. ※The biggest issue, obviously, is that bees sting,§ she says. ※That has to be top of the list of considerations. In the modern world of health and safety, schools have to know how they are going to manage that with insurance and things.§Luckily, the school she is working with had a high-profile victim who modelled a calm response. ※It was actually the headmaster who got stung first,§ she laughs. ※The staff and students have to learn how they＊re going to cope with that. Keeping it low-key is important.§In Northumberland, amateur beekeeper Jilly Halliday has worked with the volunteer-led  for five years. After seeing the benefits that young people gained from the project, she decided to speak to the headteacher at her son＊s primary school about setting up their own hive. The school was supportive and now has its own apiary at a nearby National Trust site.※Bringing bees to a school takes a gutsy teacher, but we follow strict guidelines,§ she explains. ※We usually do workshops splitting a class into groups of four. We do the risk assessment and we always have a teacher with us.※We do 15-minute sessions and it＊s fast and the students love it 每 they might be dressed up in bee suits, they might be looking through a microscope. We＊re also sponsoring teachers to become beekeepers on a 10-week course at the local horticultural college.§The key to making such projects work, she says, is for staff to be on board. ※What we＊ve learned is that as long as we＊ve got supportive teachers and headteachers, we can roll with it. The poor teachers are so stretched 每 I act as a broker and talk to them about what subject they＊re studying and work in partnership. It＊s not always easy but it works.§And the benefits, she says, are completely worth the effort. ※The kids are so inspired: they can open up a beehive and they＊ve got the smell of the wax, the propolis, the sound. It feels dangerous and exciting.§For schools that are considering beekeeping, there several things to bear in mind, as Martin Smith, public affairs spokesman for the British Beekeeping Association, explains. Above all, the choice of location for the apiary is key. The area needs to be secure, easily accessed and provide a suitable flight path for the bees. For Halliday, it was agreed that the nearby National Trust site would be the best option, while the school Hoggard works with has a field with sheep and ducks and hens where it was able house the hive.※A good way of pupils being able to view the bees is to have a shed or greenhouse adjacent to the apiary. This means the children can see the bees and the activity of the beekeeper relatively closely without the need to all wear beekeeping suits,§ Smith says.Then there is 每 of course 每 the question of money.  will need to budget for beekeeping suits, hives and consumable items, as well as the bees themselves. Hoggard estimates that this can be about ?1,000, although there are cost-saving measures that can be taken: polystyrene hives are cheaper than wooden ones (and just as effective). Her project also managed to get its bees for free 每 by putting out a hive and waiting.※There are swarms out there looking for places to live ... If you put out something of the right size and the right place that smells of beeswax, you＊ve got a pretty good chance of getting bees,§ she explains.There is also funding available to help establish projects 每 local beekeeping associations should be able to advise on this, as well as helping schools get set up safely.Ultimately, Halliday says, beekeeping can open pupils＊ eyes to a new world 每 and make them think differently about the one they live in. ※I love bees and I think everyone should. There＊s just so much to learn, it just doesn＊t stop. It＊s an old art but it＊s about looking at things from a different perspective 每 we＊re bringing an old art up to date.§"																																																			
" is the biggest single cause of the worst air pollution in Europe, a new study has found, as nitrogen compounds from fertilisers and animal waste drift over industrial regions.When the nitrogen compounds are mixed with air already polluted from industry, they combine to form solid particles that can stick in the fine lung tissue of children and adults, causing .The compounds come from nitrogen-rich fertilisers, which have been in common use for decades. Nitrogen, the major content of the air we breathe, is essential for plant growth, and enhancing that growth has led to a massive industry in putting nitrogen - already naturally present in soils - back into the ground in greater quantities.Ammonia, whose chemical composition is nitrogen and hydrogen (NH3), is a byproduct both of fertilised fields and of animal waste, as it can come from the breakdown of livestock excretions.Links between fine particulate pollution and ammonia from agricultural sources have been , but an increasing body of research suggests that this is now a leading source of air pollution.Europe, much of the US, Russia and China have been found to suffer from the problem, in the latest research from the Earth Institute at Columbia University, in the US, .When ammonia in the atmosphere reaches areas of industry, the pollutants from combustion, which include nitrogen oxides produced by diesel vehicles, and sulphur compounds from power plants and some other industrial processes, the chemicals combine to create very small particles, about 2.5 micrometres across.Although invisible to human eyes, their tiny size means these particles penetrate deep into people＊s lungs when they are breathed in. Not only can they cause breathing problems, particularly in the young, the elderly and people more vulnerable, but they can even cause heart disease. have been found to die prematurely in the UK alone because of air pollution, prompting MPs to declare the problem a .But while MPs have called for remedies such as scrapping diesel cars in favour of petrol models, and excluding the most polluting vehicles from large parts of cities, the problem of how to control pollution from agriculture has been left largely alone.That is partly because such diffuse pollution - which by its nature travels easily across long distances and international borders - is so hard to deal with.Counselling farmers to use less fertiliser is one way, but it will not solve the problem. Susanne Bauer, an atmospheric scientist at Columbia, said: ※This is not against fertiliser. There are many places, including Africa, that need more of it. We expect population to go up, and to produce more food, we will need more fertiliser.§She said that controlling other sources of industrial pollution, which are the agents that turn agricultural pollution into its harmful forms, should be the priority. Cutting down on coal-fired power stations and their sulphur emissions, using more efficient vehicles and potentially electric cars, and regulating polluting industries more tightly would all have an effect, she suggested.However, other tiny particulates can also combine with ammonia, including dust such as the .Excess fertiliser use is also one of the biggest causes of pollution in the oceans, as run-off creates ※dead zones§ in the seas where oxygen is virtually eliminated and fish and other marine life can no longer exist. The fertiliser that runs off or reaches the air is no longer helping the crops it was intended to grow, so if farmers were forced or encouraged to use less fertiliser, but use it more efficiently, the amounts that find their way into the seas and air might be reduced."																																																			
"Paris bans cars in many historic central districts at weekends, imposes odd-even bans on vehicles, makes public transport free during major pollution events and encourages car- and bike-sharing programmes. A long section of the Right Bank of the river Seine is now car-free and and a monthly ban on cars has come into force along the Champs-Elys谷es. spurred the city to ban all new large diesel cars and SUVs with engines of more than 2,000CC and to phase out tens of thousands of diesel taxis. The city has experimented with  and is now encouraging Uber-style minibuses on demand. Other cities considering diesel bans are Dublin and Brussels., allowing only electric or hydrogen vehicles. The proposed new law would allow anyone who already owns a petrol or diesel car to continue using it. Most cities encourage bicycle use.Freiburg in Germany has 500km of bike routes, tramways, and a cheap and efficient public transport system. One suburb, Vauban, forbids people to park near their homes and makes car-owners pay 18,000 for a space on the edge of town. In return for living without a car, people are offered cheaper housing, free public transport, and plentiful bicycle spaces. Copenhagen prioritises bikes over cars and now has more cycles than people. The city calculates that one mile on a bike is worth $0.42 [27p] to society, while one mile in a car is a 15p ($0.20) loss. Large parts of the Danish capital have been closed to vehicles for decades and the city plans to become carbon neutral by 2025.Oslo plans to halve its climate emissions by 2020 and proposes a large no-car zone, the building of 40 miles of new bike lanes, steep congestion charges, a rush-hour fee for motorists, and the removal of many parking spaces.

The idea is to make the city＊s public transport so good that no one will want a car by 2050. Zurich has capped the number of parking spaces in the city, only allows a certain number of cars into the city at any one time, and is building more car-free areas, plazas, tram lines and pedestrianised streets. The result has been a dramatic reduction in traffic jams, and less pollution. The southern Brazilian city of 2 million people has one of the biggest and lowest cost bus systems in the world. Nearly 70% of the city goes to work by public transport and . The Indian city is converting its 6,000 buses to compressed natural gas and discouraging the car. So far, says the city, it has reduced traffic pollution by about 20% in a few years and one in four people who used to travel by car now use public transport.

"The  is the kind of event that makes climate change personal. A co-worker of mine was forced out of his home for several days by the emergency evacuation, and another friend was visiting Lake Oroville and happened to leave 15 minutes before the evacuation order was issued.Like many extreme events, the Oroville emergency is a combination of natural weather likely intensified by climate change.

Since then, the Earth＊s surface temperature has warmed about 0.75∼C, and there＊s now more than 5% more water vapor in the atmosphere as a result, which intensifies storms. With hotter temperatures, more precipitation falls as rain and less as snow, and California＊s Sierra snowpack also melts earlier in the year.  stresses California＊s water infrastructure through all of these mechanisms.Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute has been researching the impact of climate change on the water cycle since the 1986, when his dissertation was the first research to conclude that the Sierra snowpack would be at risk due to rising temperatures from global warming. He also found that this would lead to increased winter runoff and flood risks, which is exactly what we＊re now seeing.

"Four Congolese park rangers and one porter have been killed in an ambush in the eastern .A large group of journalists and park rangers were attacked on Friday 14 July in the Okapi  Reserve by an armed local rebel group. It is believed that the journalists 每 one from the US, two Dutch, and one Congolese 每 were covering a story about the work of the rangers in the forest.The attack is thought to have been by Mai Mai rebels from the area who have been carrying out illegal poaching and mining activities. They have previously come into conflict with rangers. Following the attack, three rangers and the US national were reported missing, while the rest of the group, including 11 rangers, escaped to another Okapi reserve base.The bodies of four Congolese rangers from the state park authority, the Institut Congolais pour la  de la Nature (ICCN), and one porter were found the following day, on the evening of Saturday 15 July.

"fter a lifetime out in the field, measuring the egg-laying preferences of Californian butterflies or counting plant species living in and around Birmingham, ecologist Chris D Thomas is no typical debut author. But like so many writers, his first book, Inheritors of the Earth, has been germinating for some time.The seeds were sown in the early 2000s: Thomas was researching ways of saving animals and plants threatened by climate change, when he began to focus on the inconsistencies in attitudes to the ebb and flow of nature. ※When things died out or declined it was seen as a loss,§ he says, ※but when new things arrived it was either ignored or also counted effectively as a loss, because it was seen as a departure from how things used to be. Implicitly, people were thinking that there was a way the world  be.§We tend to think of the natural world in terms of our lifetimes, or the lifetimes of our parents and grandparents. But if you consider the environment over timescales of hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of years, it is impossible to avoid the fact that it is always changing. As an example, during the last 20,000 years 每 which in the history of life is no time at all 每 the environment in the Vale of York has been turned repeatedly on its head. Lake species were replaced by those of dune, steppe and wetland; these in turn were supplanted by forest species, later usurped by those currently living in the hay pasture outside Thomas＊s Yorkshire home. ※Every process in ecology, every process in evolution, is a dynamic one, and therefore imagining that nature is a static old master that needs to be restored to a particular state is just not a reasonable way of looking at the processes of life,§ he says.Casting aside this familiar way of thinking about the natural world does present a real problem, Thomas admits, because keeping nature as it was in the recent past is an easy goal to define and agree. ※The only problem is that 每 particularly in the context of rapidly changing climate and land use and all the other things we＊re doing to the world 每 it＊s all very well wishing it, but we＊re not going to achieve it.§Instead of focusing on preserving past ecosystems, Thomas says, we should concentrate on preserving biodiversity, so that living things can respond flexibly to future challenges. ※Nothing that I＊m saying lets us off the hook in terms of maintaining the biodiversity that we currently have, but if we accept that it＊s a dynamic system rather than a static one ＃ if we are prepared to accept biological gains as much as we regret losses, then we can take a much more optimistic view [of] conservation,§ he says.As the climate shifts, Thomas argues, we must allow animals and plants to shift as well. In some cases, this means transporting species away from places where they can no longer thrive and giving them a chance to survive elsewhere. This kind of intervention runs counter to rules and regulations designed to prevent invasive species, but Thomas says that while some species can cause trouble for human beings, when you look at other organisms, ※most of them don＊t end up causing much of a problem§.※As far as we know, no native British species has completely died out from the whole of Britain as a consequence of those arrivals. If we take a national perspective, it＊s 2,000 plus, zero minus ＃ The chances of a new arrival causing an extinction is a very, very small fraction of 1%. At the moment in the UK, empirically it＊s zero,§ he says. ※So it seems that the risk of causing a problematic invasive species that would eliminate one of the existing species is lower than the chances of the thing dying out if you don＊t move it.§Human beings have made huge changes to the natural world, Thomas admits, and some of those changes have had catastrophic effects on individual species. Think of New Zealand＊s takah言, a heavy, flightless bird that evolved on an island where there were few predators, and which is currently struggling under the relentless assault from rats and stoats. Nearly all of these are situations occur where the new species that arrives is functionally quite different, Thomas suggests, where there＊s a small part of the world 每 a remote island, or an isolated lake 每 with a missing piece of the ecological jigsaw. But when you look at those changes on a wider scale and examine their effect on the variety of living things, the picture improves. ※It appears to be empirically true that, over the last couple of hundred years, those parts of the world that we know about as regions have increased numbers of species,§ he says.The author conjures up a future in which African black rhinos find refuge in Mediterranean shrubland, or butterflies from Provence can survive on grasslands in southern England, a world where wingnut trees, currently threatened in the Caucasian mountains, can flourish in British gardens. As soon as you discard the fiction that life on Earth can return to some prelapsarian idyll, conservationists have much more flexibility to protect species in new places, to form new combinations of habitats.Making the case for managed change in a political climate where business speaks louder than the natural world holds some dangers, as Thomas acknowledges, but trying to prevent all change just isn＊t working. ※Ultimately, we have to accept the rate of change and understand how we are going to work with it, because if we try to fight all change then, on timescales of decades, we＊re not going to succeed. There＊s no point, for the sake of political convenience, in continuing to steer our ship in a way that simply isn＊t viable.§Whatever solutions we come up with, he is adamant that they can＊t ignore the needs of the species which now 每 for better or worse 每 controls the fate of the planet. People can only look after the environment when they don＊t have to worry about their own day-to-day survival. ※Call me a dreamer,§ he says, ※but if we＊re interested in the natural world, then we need a healthy and well-fed world population.§"																																																			
"Sushi bars and shops are regularly mis-selling exotic species of fish to unwitting British customers, .In cases cited in the report, customers thought they were buying a fish from the Atlantic when it was really a tropical variety, while many fish were sold under a generic name that revealed little about where they came from. Some of the species were endangered, while others were so rare that little was known about their population size. The findings suggest that an increasingly complex and globalised food supply chain is open to abuse, putting exotic species at risk.※This is about transparency,§ said Professor Stefano Mariani, a conservation geneticist at Salford University, who, along with his colleague, Cristina di Muri, presented the study at the  at Exeter University earlier this month. ※People don＊t know what they are buying. There is now a huge trade in lesser-known species that have not been assessed. We are talking about hundreds of species of fish. We found they are just not being correctly labelled. Imagine how impossible it is for a consumer to make an informed purchasing decision.§The pair tested samples from grocery shops in Liverpool and Manchester. They found fish labelled as red snapper, a tropical fish used in Caribbean cooking, was actually redfish, a cold water Atlantic species.

Some of these species are not necessarily palatable.§Mariani and Di Muri suggested that most of the samples identified in their study were unfamiliar to British diners because they had appeared only recently in the UK market, largely because of the growing number of shops catering to different ethnic groups.A separate study of sushi bars conducted by Mariani found that about 10% of fish sold had been substituted for another species. In addition, critically endangered species of tuna and eel were being sold without customers being told that they were at risk.※If you just lump fish under some vague term you＊re not going to do much to help the consumer know what they should consume or why they should choose certain fish over others,§ Mariani said. ※The supply chain is now so complicated. It starts in one corner of the world and spreads out across so many middle-men. There are so many opportunities for inaccuracy, bad translation and deliberate misreporting 每 all the way to the consumer＊s plate.§Part of the problem, Mariani suggested, is that British people know little about fish. A survey he conducted found the average British consumer could identify just two out of six common fish shown to them. About half were familiar with salmon and mackerel, about one in three recognised cod, and less than one in five were able to identify sole, anchovy and sea bass."																																																			
" single blue whale, even with a skeleton of 4.5 tonnes, weighs imperceptibly in the world＊s scales when biological annihilation is?set on the other side. Yet perhaps  of the entrance hall of Natural History Museum in London may play some tiny part in tipping the balance. By?replacing ※Dippy§ 每 the much-loved cast of a diplodocus skeleton 每 with a creature whose relatives still swim the oceans, the museum seeks to remind us of the glories that remain in the natural world, and the urgent need to conserve them.The whale was unveiled as the Guardian revealed that researchers believe  (marginally more optimistic scientists think we are merely on the verge of such an event). Estimating overall populations 每 not just the number of exterminated species 每 they conclude that up to 50% of all land animals have been lost in recent decades. Unlike the , which saw off Dippy et al, this one is manmade. Scientists blame human over-population and consumption and expect the challenges to intensify, ※painting a dismal picture of the future of life, including human life§. We are not just threatening the creatures with whom we share the world; we?are risking our own future. Admittedly, other new research assures us that life on Earth is secure . But while the endurance of the portly micro-animals known as tardigrades may console those thinking on such a grand scale, most of us would rather these creatures have company 每 including ours.Can disaster be averted? Humans hunted blue whales to the brink of extinction but, thanks to the international ban, the population has recovered from hundreds to around 20,000. It is a fraction of the previous level, but the start of a viable population: enough for the museum＊s specimen to be named Hope. Though few of?the species under threat , they are as precious. At present, conservation efforts are nation- or creature-specific. A far more ambitious approach is needed: ultimately, a Paris-style accord for biodiversity going beyond the current trade-focused Cites agreement. First must come a recognition of how pressing the dangers are. Where there＊s Hope, may there be life."																																																			
																																																			
"Torres Strait residents face being forced from their homes by climate change, as their islands are lost to rising seas.On Boigu Island, the most northerly inhabited island in Australia, just six kilometres from Papua New Guinea, the community＊s cemetery faces inundation and roads are being washed into the sea. A seawall installed to protect the community is already failing.Boigu elder Dennis Gibuma says the situation is worsening every season.※Our seawall is no longer any good,§ he says. ※When the high tide and strong winds come together, it breaks. We pray we don＊t lose our homes. We don＊t want to leave this place.§Masig Island, to the south-east of Boigu, is less than three kilometres long, and just 800m across at its widest point. Also known as Yorke Island, the low-lying coral cay is steadily being lost to the waves.※The island is being eaten,§ says Songhi Billy, an engineering officer on Masig. ※This is a big issue. I kind of feel hopeless in a sense. Our land is part of us.※In the short term, we can do what we can. We can＊t stop the erosion, our hope is to slow it down.§But he says he has to face the possibility that his people may have to abandon their ancestral home.※Long term, we may have to evacuate the island,§ he says. ※But I am not going. Slowly, I see Masig Island getting out of something I can control.§Fisherman Joseph Billy says his community is losing land every year.※Last five year, every year, I have moved my shed back from the beach another few metres. We used to have a road that went all around the island but now it is broken. We will lose our land eventually.§Sea levels around the world are  between 75cm and 1.5m by the end of the century, depending on greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Australian Department of Environment and Energy, a rise of just 50cm would  每 making a once a century flood likely to occur several times a year. In some areas of Australia, flooding risk would rise much more 每 up to 10,000 times.The precise sea level rise around the Torres Strait, and the projected inundation, has not been calculated but low-lying islands are expected to experience a much greater flooding risk than mainland Australia. The department identifies the remote islands of the Torres Strait as some of the most vulnerable,  (IPCC), which warns communities they may be forced to relocate.The chief executive of Oxfam Australia, Helen Szoke, who visited the Torres Strait at the invitation of the Torres council mayor, Vonda Malone, says the people of the strait have contributed almost nothing to the causes of climate change but are being ※hit first and hardest by its impacts§.※The islands face a combination of risks including coastal erosion and inundation from rising seas, damage to the critical marine ecosystems on which their livelihoods depend, higher temperatures and shifting rainfall. Roads are being washed away and seawalls cannot protect communities from flooding.§The ※strong, flourishing communities§ of the Torres Strait have a powerful connection to their land and sea country, Szoke says. ※The gravest fear among community members is the loss of their connection to land and culture if they are faced with the last resort 每 being forced to leave their islands. The longer-term challenges, including the threat of eventually being forced from their land, are complex and extremely confronting for communities with such a deep connection to their islands.§Malone says leaving the islands is a last resort and the people of the Torres Strait want to do everything possible to remain.※These communities are facing ongoing challenges in retaining their foreshore and their gathering places 每 this is their land and the land of their ancestors. These communities are seeing their land washed away. We have been advocating for years but it just does not seem to get enough attention.§Malone says while some funding for climate change adaptation is filtering through, there were few resources to address the social impacts of potential dislocation.※There is a feeling of hopelessness as communities do not know where this is going to lead to,§ Malone says.Displacement caused by climate change is forecast to be a driver of massive forced migration movements in the 21st century.Low-lying islands in the Pacific 每 and Torres Strait islands like Masig and Boigu 每 are likely to be at the forefront of forced displacement but large and  also face widespread inundation.Some forecasts have predicted up to  每 larger than the record number of people already forced from their homes globally.The  poses the greatest security threat to the Asia-Pacific.But the global legal framework for resettling people displaced from their homes lost to natural disasters or climate change is unclear. The  每 established in 1951 to regularise the resettlement of those displaced by the second world war 每 does not recognise someone forced from their home by rising seas, or natural disaster, as requiring protection.Already,  on the grounds that their homes are uninhabitable because of rising seas or climate-related disaster. All have had their claims rejected.On Masig Island, Hilda Mosby says climate change is already affecting the marine ecosystems on which communities depend for their livelihoods.  is already affecting her community ※big time§, she says.But the greater existential threat for her home lies ahead.※When we talk about relocation, it is clear this is very much a last resort,§ Mosby says. ※This is our home. No one is willing to leave, to lose their cultural ties, the loved ones they have laid to rest here. We want to try everything to keep our community here.§ "																																																			
"Sir  has said he is more encouraged about the future health of Earth than he has been for some time after a ※worldwide shift§ in attitudes about concern for the natural world and the damage that humans are doing to the planet.The veteran wildlife broadcaster said there are ※signs of hope§ for the health of the planet and called the  a ※big advance§ in an interview at the Edinburgh TV festival despite President Donald Trump＊s disengagement.※I spend a lot of time wringing my hands and saying how dreadful it is that this forest has been obliterated and that sea has been polluted and whatever,§ Attenborough said. ※But there are signs of hope.※I have the sense that worldwide, certainly in Europe, certainly in China 每 which we never thought before was concerned 每 and even perhaps if I may say so there are people in America 每  每 who don＊t accept that human beings can do no wrong.※There has been a worldwide shift, I think, among people in general about the concern there should be for the natural world. I am encouraged more than I have been for some time.§The Paris climate change agreement between nearly 200 countries tried to limit the increase in global temperatures compared with the pre-industrial age to well below 2C and ideally to 1.5C. The agreement was signed last year but Trump pulled the US out of the deal after becoming president.※I think the Paris agreement represents another big advance,§ Attenborough said. ※I would like to think the reason that political figures can adopt that sort of policy, which they know will be at a cost to their national economies, is that they are beginning to realise that people worldwide wish for that happen because they wish to protect their natural world.§The 91-year-old 每 who was described by Barack Obama as a ※great educator§ when they met in 2015 每 argued that natural history programmes had a vital role to play in educating people about conservation issues. One of the tasks of the BBC, he added, was keep the natural world at the forefront of people＊s minds.※The effect that human beings are having on the natural world is profound,§ he said. ※We are having a great damaging effect. Because we are out of touch with the natural world in a way that we weren＊t 200 years ago [because of urbanisation] that means most of us don＊t see the effect we are having. What is more, we don＊t understand the processes of the natural world, which makes this [natural history broadcasting] of crucial importance to the future of humanity.§Attenborough also admitted that he cried watching the birth of an elephant with crippled back legs 每 which eventually learned to walk 每 and seeing a herd of elephants seemingly grieve over the bones of dead elephants. ※One of the things that has brought tears to my eyes is particularly elephant sequences,§ the veteran broadcaster said."																																																			
"A cross party group of MPs is calling on  to adopt a clean air bill in his new strategy to tackle the crisis of air pollution in the UK.Sixty five MPs have written to the environment secretary as he prepares to address the most pressing issue in his intray 每 a demand by judges for a new air quality strategy by 31 July to cut illegal levels of pollution from diesel vehicles.Labour MP Geraint Davies, who introduced a clean air bill into the last parliament, said there was cross party support for the measures. These include:Levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), emitted mostly by diesel vehicles, have been above legal limits in almost 90% of urban areas in the UK since 2010. The toxic fumes are estimated to cause 23,500 early deaths a year and the problem was declared a  by a cross-party committee of MPs in April 2016.The government＊s plans to tackle air pollution have been found by judges to be so poor that they are unlawful. Gove has until the end of July to come up with a new air quality strategy which will cut emissions in the shortest possible time.The government also faces stiff fines from the European commission, which has sent Britain a final warning to comply with EU air pollution limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or face a case at the European court of justice.A draft of the government＊s plan was published in May before Gove took over as environment secretary. But it was widely condemned, Evidence published as part of the draft plan suggested that a network of clean air zones which stop the dirtiest diesel vehicles entering the most polluted areas of UK towns and cities would be the most effective solution. But the plan did not mandate local authorities to create such zones.The MPs, who include Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP and Green members of parliament, called in their letter for Gove to implement the measures in the clean air bill in the new air quality strategy.Davies said: ※Thanks to the cross party support for the [clean air] bill, I have been able to unite growing pressure on the new Defra secretary Michael Gove to take bold action to give the UK leadership in combatting air pollution, which is now a public health disaster.§The government has repeatedly lost in the courts over its failure to tackle dirty air. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth won a case against the government in the supreme court in April 2015, when judges ordered ministers to come up with a plan to reduce air pollution to within legal limits as soon as possible.When the plan was released ClientEarth took the government back to court and it was found to be so poor it was illegal. The courts ordered the government to revise its plans. If the UK does not satisfy the European commission that it is acting to reduce its emissions, it could face a lump sum fine, a penalty payment, daily five-figure fines, or a combination of these.Officials  by the judgements of the European court in Luxembourg for as long as it remains a member of the EU."																																																			
"Last year, the European Space Agency launched the Trace Gas Orbiter to Mars. It is designed to look for methane 每 a key tracer of life 每 .Now, ESA is preparing to launch another spacecraft to look at methane on another planet: our own.The UK-built Sentinel-5P, a pollution monitoring satellite, is ready to begin its journey from , Stevenage, to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia, where it will lift off in late September/early October.Sentinel-5P is part of the Copernicus global monitoring programme, a joint venture between the European Commission and the . This particular spacecraft is the first Copernicus satellite dedicated to monitoring atmospheric chemistry.Missions like this are essential for making the connection between space and everyday life on Earth, according to Colin Paynter, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and , UK. He says, ※Space is not just for geeks, it is part of our national and international infrastructure.§As a greenhouse gas, methane is potent. It traps 28 times more heat than an equivalent mass of carbon dioxide. It is released naturally by living things 每 hence the interest in looking for it on Mars 每 but also from the fossil fuel industry, landfill sites, rice agriculture and the thawing of the permafrost at higher latitudes.As well as methane, Sentinel-5 P will also look for nitrogen dioxide and other key polluting gases.Nitrogen dioxide comes mainly from road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion, and naturally occurring forest fires.  from the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health found that in the UK air pollution causes at least 40,000 deaths a year, and costs the economy ?20bn a year.Sentinel-5P will be able to  which can then be compared to their self-declared pollution inventories. It will image the whole Earth every day, and can also monitor concentrations of volcanic ash for air safety, and warn against high levels of the UV radiation that can cause skin cancer.The  aims to provide comprehensive Earth observation data to improve the management of the environment. It will eventually consist of 20 missions, 15 of which will be dedicated satellites and 5 of which will be instruments on other spacecraft.※A system like this has never existed before,§ says Josef Aschbacher, Director of Earth Observation Programmes, European Space Agency. ※The US and other partners are looking to Europe to make deals to get access to this data.§In a , business secretary Greg Clark said, ※The UK-built Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and the success of the Copernicus Programme demonstrates what we can achieve through collaboration with our European partners and the UK＊s vital role in the programme thanks to our Earth observation expertise.§Aschbacher confirms that the UK has been a strong partner and says that from a programme management point of view, he wants to see that role continue but, ※Brexit is the thing that is floating above us.§Although the UK will remain a member of ESA, around 70 percent of the Copernicus programme is funded from the European Commission. As such, Britain＊s future involvement seems certain to be affected by the Brexit settlement.※It is clearly important to our industry to stay a part of the programme,§ says Graham Turnock, Chief Executive, UK Space Agency, ※We cannot wait until the day before Brexit to get clarity on this.§Separately, the future of the Copernicus programme is part of an on-going series of negotiations between ESA, its member countries and the European Commission. Aschbacher says that such constant reappraisal is essential, ※We have the best system in the world. In 10 years, I want to ensure that we still have the best system in the world.§The next major hurdle is an ESA Ministerial Meeting in late 2019, after the UK has left the EU. Here, each country will agree how much to contribute to Copernicus and each of the space agency＊s other programmes.The Sentinel-5P mission is designed to last for seven years in an 824km-altitude orbit around the Earth.

"Hundreds of people gathered at Baobab Village in Dar es Salaam to pay tribute to Wayne Lotter on Tuesday evening, as tributes continued to come in from around the world. Lotter, 51, was  while travelling in a taxi from the airport to his hotel on Dar es Salaam＊s Msasani Peninsula. Lotter, who co-founded PAMS Foundation, a conservation nonprofit, was responsible for supporting anti-poaching efforts that had led to the arrests of more than 2000 ivory poachers and traffickers, and had taken down several key poaching syndicates in the country. He had received numerous death threats since starting the organization in 2009. At his memorial, friends, colleagues and foreign dignitaries, including representatives from the Chinese embassy, many wearing black t-shirts with a logo of Lotter standing with a group elephants and the word ＆true hero＊ in English, Swahili and Mandarin, praised and thanked Lotter for his dedication to wildlife and the strides he made to end the ivory trade. His partner Krissie Clark told the Guardian afterwards that she had been particularly moved by ※the mix of people who came§. At the end, ※everybody clapped, but they clapped and clapped and clapped and clapped and stood up, one could feel the emotion in the air. The love for Wayne was evident.§ Lotter was described by many as a ＆silent hero＊ who often deflected credit for his work to his partners. ※[Before] our law enforcement was just doing routine raids, so how do we change the tide?§ Robert Mande, the head of anti-poaching at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism in Tanzania, remembered asking Lotter.※He told me we should not despair, we should work day and night to change the tide. Then we started to think about how to do operations beyond our traditions and his [intelligence-based] approach is a popular concept that we at the Ministry are now using.§ Mande, who spoke on behalf of the Tanzania government, said Lotter＊s legacy will have a lasting impact on conservation efforts.※We＊re just going to work hard to make sure what Wayne wanted to reach, we are going to reach it and elephants are going to be all around Tanzania,§ Mande said. ※We will never despair because of this.§Iain Douglas-Hamilton, English zoologist and the founder of Save The Elephants also spoke at the memorial and praised Lotter for his work. A crowdfunding initiative for Lotter aims to raise $50,000 US in donations for Lotter＊s family. He leaves behind his wife, twin daughters, and parents who all live in his native South Africa. Money raised will be used to help his family with costs related to his death, including relocating his body from Tanzania to South  where a funeral will be held on August 26.According to the crowdfunding page, anything raised above the amount needed to cover these costs will be put into legacy trust in Lotter＊s name, and will fund intelligence-gathering against the ivory trade, and help the families of other wildlife rangers who are killed on duty. In the last couple of weeks alone,  rangers  have been killed while working. Police have not yet announced the arrest of any suspects in connection with the killing of conservationist Wayne Lotter.The Dar es Salaam Special Police Zone Commander, Lucas Mkondya says that police are still investigating the killing but have not so far not arrested anybody. ※The police force will provide all information once the investigation is completed. I encourage you to remain calm as we continue investigating the matter.§Two days after Lotter＊s death, Professor Jumanne Maghembe, Minister of Tourism and Natural Resources, announced that the police had arrested six people in connection with 28 elephant tusks in Dar Es Salaam.Diplomatic sources in Dar es Salaam said that Lotter had been tracing the arrested suspects for a while. It remains unclear whether the arrests are connected with his killing.But Clark says that the work of PAMS will continue. ※Work is progressing as normal, but with more determination. Village game scout training is currently taking place. The national taskforce for anti-poaching had a big bust of ivory and arrested several people. We are also keeping on with our human wildlife conflict initiatives and environmental education.§ "																																																			
"re you an insomniac show-off, who has dense undergrowth and a pond in your garden? Are you keen to wipe out all the local toads and frogs, and fairly relaxed about having hookworm, flatworm or fatal fox tapeworm? If so, then the raccoon dog is the pet for you. And you may be able to buy one at an .The  that you didn＊t, however:  are wild animals, one of the earliest forms of dog, and related to foxes and wolves (although no relation to actual raccoons, despite visual similarities) 每 they often go into a sort of torpor in winter, are mainly nocturnal and are certainly not happy in market cages or houses. So people who keep them as pets tend to get sick of them. This can lead to raccoon dogs being released into the countryside, where they multiply rapidly, with disastrous consequences for local wildlife.After being introduced to Russia and other European countries from east Asia 80 years ago, mainly to be hunted for their fur, the raccoon dog has spread far and wide. In Finland, where a million cubs are born annually, they prey on frogs and toads, with the southernmost part of the country greatly depleted, according to  Sweden is now trying to eradicate them, while the country still has a few frogs, toads and ground-nesting birds left.Beyond these difficulties countries have encountered with the superficially cute raccoon dog, it＊s the word ※eradicate§ that makes me want to tear my hair out, because we face a well-worn story when it comes to : we discover a cute, fluffy, huge or handsome new creature 每 parakeet, turtle, mink or big cat 每 and buy it as a pet, only to get horribly injured by the animal, or just bored, exhausted or overwhelmed looking after it. We let it go in the wild, where the animal reproduces like billy-o, and then we have to have it put down or mass murder it, because the new species is playing havoc with us or our native wildlife.There aren＊t many raccoon dogs in Britain yet, but as they are so fluffy and cuddly-looking and only the size of a medium dog, they are on the increase. It is still perfectly legal to stuff them into a cramped cage and flog them to someone who hasn＊t a clue how to look after them. Do we ever learn? Sadly, I think not."																																																			
"he global effort to confront climate change was hobbled for many years by the mistaken idea that only national governments and international rules could solve the problem. The , which recognizes and supports voluntary carbon-reduction efforts by cities, regions and businesses, was an important step in the right direction. Ironically, no one has done more to demonstrate the agreement＊s strengths than its most prominent critic: Donald Trump.Last week, the Trump administration formally notified the UN of its intention to withdraw from the Paris agreement. It was an empty gesture, because no party can actually withdraw until November 2020 (right after the next US presidential election). What matters is this: the US is on pace to reach the commitment we made under the agreement 每 and there is nothing Washington can do to stop us.Over the past decade, the US has led the world in reducing carbon emissions. In that time, the US Congress has never passed a single law directly aimed at climate change. The central climate-related regulation adopted by the Obama administration 每 a carbon emission standard for power plants 每 was put on hold by the courts and never even went into effect. And yet we are already about halfway to our Paris goal of reducing carbon emissions by at least 26% by 2025.That progress has happened because cities, states, business and citizens all recognize the health and economic benefits of action. And they are not slowing down now. In fact, the biggest impact of Trump＊s withdrawal from the Paris agreement has been to accelerate those efforts and improve public understanding of their central role in fighting climate change. Take cities, which are home to the majority of the world＊s people for the first time in human history. Mayors understand that the same steps that reduce carbon emissions also make cities better places to live and work 每 and where people want to live, businesses want to invest. Mass transit, parks and trees, and less traffic congestion all reduce air pollution and carbon emissions, while helping cities to grow. Globally, cities account for about 70% of carbon emissions. That makes them the bulk of the problem, but they are also the source of the most effective solutions. In New York City, we were able to reduce emissions by 19% in just six years, while also outpacing the nation in job growth. Mayors around the world, from across the political spectrum, are increasing their use of clean energy sources, such as wind and solar, which is now often cheaper than fossil fuels. Since the Trump administration announced its intent to withdraw from the Paris agreement, more than 2,500 US cities, states, businesses and universities have signed a letter reaffirming their commitment to the agreement＊s goals. Bloomberg Philanthropies is helping lead an effort 每 we call it ※America＊s Pledge§ 每 to measure the collective potential of all these groups to reduce their carbon emissions. Just as every nation has done, we will create a clear and transparent report to account for these efforts, and show how they help us to fulfill the pledge we made in Paris. These reports will be made available to the UN and the parties to the Paris agreement.We＊ll also work with our partners to draw up a blueprint for how each group can accelerate their progress, despite current inaction by the federal government. That includes helping cities access financing for green infrastructure and developing regional policies that encourage investment in clean energy. Under the leadership of Governor Jerry Brown, the state of California 每 by itself the world＊s sixth-largest economy 每 recently announced a commitment to getting 60% of its energy from clean sources and strengthened its cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. Other states can follow suit.There is also more action coming from the private sector. Until recently it has been hard for businesses to measure the potential financial impacts they face from climate change, which makes them difficult to prevent and reduces incentives to address the problem. It also makes it hard for investors to know which companies are most vulnerable to climate risk and which are taking action. Last year, I was asked by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, to chair a global Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures to help close this data gap, by creating financial standards for measuring and reporting climate risks. We recently released a set of recommendations and are working to help more companies adopt them. National pledges under the Paris agreement assume involvement from national governments 每 but the fact is, in the US, progress on climate change has always been driven from the bottom up. More help from Washington would be helpful and welcome, but cities, states and businesses aren＊t waiting for it. The benefits of action 每 and the risks of inaction 每 are too great."																																																			
																																																			
"n a global first, Australian mum-and-dad shareholders Guy and Kim Abrahams have launched a case against the Commonwealth Bank, arguing that the bank has breached the law by not disclosing the risks climate change poses to its business.Buying their shares over 20 years ago, Guy and Kim were making ※an investment in their children＊s futures§. A climate-changed world of financial risk, social upheaval and environmental degradation is clearly not the future they signed up for. is an immediate threat to the entire global financial system. This was the ominous warning that came from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority earlier this year. And they＊re taking it seriously, declaring that they＊ll be stress-testing the Australian financial system to force the financial sector to do more to transition to a clean economy. They＊re right to do so.Climate change is the ※tragedy of the horizon,§ governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney warned in a  last year. ※We don＊t need an army of actuaries to tell us that the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors 每 imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix§, he said.As Mr Carney predicted, despite the scale and urgency of the climate crisis and popular support for climate action, governments and financiers are failing to act. However, international pressure and momentum is growing for corporations to declare and appropriately deal with the risks that climate change presents to the value of their assets and their future profitability.The Asset Owners Disclosure Project (AODP), which I chaired, has led the world debate by surveying, rating, and ranking the world＊s 500 largest investors on climate-risk management with the AODP global climate index over the last decade. Funds are rated from AAA through to D grade, with an extra X category being added for those funds at the bottom that appear to be doing absolutely nothing to manage this critical risk.This year,  found that the scales have finally tipped. A 60% majority of asset owners, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, foundations and endowments, and half of asset managers, including Deutsche Asset Management and HSBC Global Asset Management, are now taking action to manage the risks and opportunities posed by climate change.Institutional investors are growing increasingly impatient with companies dragging their heels. Earlier this year BlackRock Inc, the world＊s largest asset manager with about US$5.1tn under management announced, . ※Ultimately the board is responsible for protecting the long-term economic interests of shareholders and we may vote against the re-election of certain directors where we believe they have not fulfilled that duty§ BlackRock said.This echoes statements by  earlier this year that directors will be individually responsible for failing to appropriately manage climate change risks, following the release of an influential . Mr Hutely found that company directors who fail to properly consider and disclose foreseeable climate-related risks to their business could be held personally liable for breaching their statutory duty of due care and diligence under the Corporations Act, warning it＊s ※only a matter of time§ before we see this sort of litigation against a director.And at the G20 summit last month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney released the final report of the Michael Bloomberg-led task force on climate-related financial disclosure.※Warming of the planet caused by greenhouse gas emissions poses serious risks to the global economy and will have an impact across many economic sectors,§ Bloomberg said to Carney in a letter that introduced the report. ※It is difficult for investors to know which companies are most at risk from climate change, which are best prepared, and which are taking action.§National regulators in the US and UK are weighing in too, investigating large companies for failing to disclose the risk of climate change to their businesses. In 2015, the New York attorney general launched an investigation into ExxonMobil. Attorney generals in numerous US states and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have since joined this investigation or launched their own.In the UK, the Financial Reporting Council has opened an examination into whether two oil and gas exploration companies listed on the London Stock Exchange have made adequate risk disclosures in their annual reports.As public outrage continues to intensify over the Commonwealth Bank＊s refusal to rule out funding the Adani mine, we should hope that with this case the bank will finally start taking climate change seriously. Not with blustering statements or carefully stage-managed greenwashing, but with real decisive action to protect its shareholders 每 and the broader community 每 from the devastation that will come if they fail to do so.This case should come as no surprise to the boards or CEOs of banks, or indeed anyone who＊s been paying attention to which way the wind is blowing in the financial sector.Banks, investors and super funds have a choice: step up on climate change today and become leaders, or face similar action as more shareholders step forward to take them on over their failure to act.By stepping up on climate risk, the financial sector has the opportunity to ensure the smooth transition of our economy to prepare it for the oncoming threat of climate catastrophe. By doing so, we may just avert the financial chaos that will come if action is left too late."																																																			
"Military and climate experts, including a former chief of the defence force, have warned that Australia faces potential ※disastrous consequences§ from climate change, including ※revolving§ natural disasters and the forced migration of tens of millions of people across the region, overwhelming security forces and government.Former defence force chief , now adjunct professor at the strategic and defence studies centre at the Australian National University, said in a  to a  that Australia＊s ability to mitigate and respond to the impacts of climate change had been corrupted by political timidity: ※Australia＊s climate change credentials have suffered from a serious lack of political leadership§.The  also heard from some of the country＊s leading climate scientists, who warned the security threats posed by climate change had been underestimated, and complained Australia had been ※walking away§ from exactly the type of research that would help the country prepare.Other experts, however, counselled against ※alarmist§ predictions and said the focus of climate change response should be on those people most acutely affected by it, rather than the security concerns of developed countries most able to respond. the security threat of climate change was comparable to that posed by nuclear war, and said the Australian continent would be most affected by changing climate.※We will suffer great effects from these changes, such as new weather patterns; droughts, sea-level rises and storm surges, because we have substantial urban infrastructure built on the coastal fringe; ravages of more intense and more frequent heatwaves and tropical revolving storms.§But he said the existential impacts of climate change were likely to be first, and most severely, felt across Australia＊s region, the Asia-Pacific rim, the most populous region in the world, and one that will be home to seven billion people by 2050. Barrie posited a scenario in which the glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan-Hindu Kush ranges 每 which reliably deliver fresh water into China, the Mekong Delta, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan 每 would disappear.※A serious shortage of fresh water brings famine; starving people are a very serious security problem. The question then becomes ＆what will happen if starving people on the rim of Asia are looking for a new home?＊※Historical evidence suggests that under such circumstances mass migration of these people will occur. It follows that several tens of millions of people might seek better fortunes in Australia and possibly New Zealand.※Most other options for settlement in our region would already have high population densities. Our security forces, and all arms of government, would be overwhelmed in such a scenario.§The Australian Defence Force has been examining the potential insecurities caused by climate change for a decade. Within Defence, there are serious concerns over the vulnerability of military bases to climate impacts, and the military＊s reliance on fossil fuels.But Barrie said political action lagged far behind and Australia＊s hyper-politicised debate over climate had hampered decisive government action.※Our current posture is a manifest failure of leadership,§ he said.Scientists at the , led by Andy Pitman from the University of New South Wales, said in their submission that climate scientists could help the country prepare for these sorts of threats but that investments in the required work was not occurring.They noted many assessments of the threats to national security posed by climate change may be an underestimation, and called for a ※high-level taskforce to examine risks associated with climate change and national security§.※Most assessments linking climate change with climate risk have assumed changes are well described by the average,§ they said, arguing this needed to be ※urgently modified§.They said that focusing on average temperature rise masks more serious changes that will occur in relation to extreme events and ※compound events§.※We do not know where or when extreme events will hit, which regions will become less vulnerable and which regions will suddenly emerge to be vulnerable,§ they say. They said those problems could be solved, but that Australia was not devoting enough research to the issue.They also noted that while infrastructure and systems are often built to be resilient against isolated events 每 such as sea-level rise or a storm 每 that design often assumes they will happen in isolation, but if they occur together they could be ※catastrophic§.Again, the scientists said Australia was not focussing on the topic and noted that the US was examining compound events including the co-occurrence of droughts and heatwaves.※Australia lags behind the US and some European countries in examining, assessing and responding to climate-change risks in terms of national security,§ they said.※Vulnerabilities associated with national security and climate change are already increasing and exist now. These are not ＆future issues＊ that can be left for a decade before strategies are considered. The creation of a high-level taskforce to examine risks associated with climate change and national security is urgent and overdue.§Jane McAdam, director of  told the inquiry , that magnified risk and exacerbated existing crises.※Disasters become disasters on steroids: more frequent and more intense.  is also a process. Slow-onset impacts such as sea-level rise or desertification take place over time, resulting in a gradual deterioration of living conditions that ultimately renders land uninhabitable.§But she said the prospect of massive, sudden international migration was highly unlikely, and focused on the wrong people.※Reasoned, empirically-grounded analysis has too often been overshadowed by alarmist and ill-informed assumptions about the numbers of people on the move, and the nature of that movement. As a result, the security analysis has been ＆flipped＊ away from the needs of the most vulnerable communities to instead focus on the national security of developed states, premised on the flawed notion that they will be inundated by people fleeing the impacts of climate change.§McAdam said most displacement and migration would occur within countries, not across national borders.※Longer-term movement will generally be gradual rather sudden, and movement that is sudden (for instance, in the aftermath of a disaster) will often require temporary relief rather than permanent migration. There is scant evidence to justify claims that there will be mass outflows of people across international borders which will threaten international, regional or national security, or generate new risks of Islamist terrorism or fundamentalism.§McAdam said internal displacement could generate low-level social tensions and potential conflict over key resources such as land, housing, food, water and employment.The parliamentary inquiry has also heard climate change has already contributed to and worsened conflicts across the world, including in Mali, Yemen, and the Arab Spring and civil war in Syria from 2011.The International Committee of the Red Cross said the destruction of the natural environment or access to scarce resources was often used as a weapon of war.※In armed conflict, the natural resources on which people rely are often attacked in contravention of IHL [international humanitarian law] provisions. This can take the form of theft or killing of livestock, theft of land, drainage or poisoning of water resources, destruction of places of trade and livelihood. Removing the basis of communities＊ resilience and capacity to adapt to changing weather conditions imperils their survival and contributes to displacement and poverty.§"																																																			
																																																			
"Britain was the world＊s largest exporter of legal ivory between 2010 and 2015, a breakdown of records held by the Convention on international trade in endangered species (Cites) has revealed.Not only did the UK export more ivory than anyone else to Hong Kong and China 每 which are considered  for ※blood ivory§ - it also sold on 370% more ivory than the next highest exporter, the USA.The new trade analysis, which is being released ahead of World Elephant Day on Saturday, will embarrass the government, after  on ivory exports last month.Mary Rice, the executive director of the  which carried out the research said: ※UK ivory exports are stimulating consumer demand globally, especially in Hong Kong and China, two of the world＊s largest markets for both legal and illegal ivory.※The UK Government should stop issuing permits for all ivory exports with immediate effect, not least to show solidarity with the Hong Kong and Chinese governments which have both committed to closing their domestic ivory markets.§Domestic ivory trading in China is due to be banned by the year＊s end, while the EU  每 whole tusks, ivory chunks or scraps.International rules still allow Britain and other countries to legally export ivory when it is certified as having been ※worked§ or ※carved§ before 1976. And the UK government has dragged its heels over taking action,  to ※press for a total ban on ivory sales§ in the summer election campaign earlier this year. Antique ivory products manufactured before 1947 每 such as billard balls, piano keys and chess pieces - are also legal and do not need a certificate, providing their age can be established.Campaigners say that this creates a loophole, allowing ivory sawed from the 30,000 elephants killed for their tusks each year, to enter the market.※As well as fuelling demand for ivory, the UK＊s legal trade provides opportunities for the laundering of illegal ivory, both within the country and internationally,§ Rice said. The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder who has campaigned on the issue, said: ※This huge amount of trade going through the UK shames us all. It creates and sustains a market that needs to be shut down. ※The government should recognise that this is crisis time for elephants. On our watch, we could see the extinction of the majority of elephants in most of their range countries. We have to stand up and say that this is not acceptable.§The UK is hosting  next year, but its colonial history has bequeathed it a stockpile of ivory artefacts wrenched from more than a million elephants, . Around 30,000 tonnes of ivory were shipped out of Africa 每 much of it using slave labour 每 during the days of empire.A spokesperson for the Department for environment, food and rural affairs said: ※Protecting elephants and ending the illegal ivory trade is a priority for us, which is why we have invested ?26m since 2014 to tackle this insidious industry. However, this is not the end of our ambition as we will continue our role as a global leader in the fight against the illegal ivory trade.§Hopes for a move towards a total ban were buoyed by a parliamentary statement from the foreign secretary last month. Questioned about official policy on the bloody trade, Boris Johnson said that the government was committed to an  ※and that is what we intend to pursue§.However, some MEPs fear that a removal of EU regulatory oversight coupled with the prioritisation of trade issues after Brexit may obstruct conservation efforts.※If the government has to go cap in hand to other countries for trade deals, I＊m really concerned that we might start seeing a slip in standards,§ Bearder said.Between 2010 and 2012, the USA was the main destination for UK ivory imports but this changed dramatically between 2013 and 2015, as exports to Hong Kong and China surged ahead, the data breakdown shows.Italy overtook Britain as the world＊s largest single ivory seller in 2015, but the UK cumulatively consigned more ivory than the next four biggest exporting countries over the five-year period between 2010 and 2015.Last month two tonnes of ivory were crushed in Central Park in New York. The US now has  on the sale or resale of ivory than the UK. "																																																			
"Today is the United Nations＊ (UN) , numbering an estimated 370 million in 90 countries and speaking roughly 7,000 languages. To mark it, the Guardian interviews Kankanaey Igorot woman Victoria Tauli-Corpuz about the UN＊s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which she calls ※historic§ and was adopted 10 years ago.Tauli-Corpuz, from the Philippines, was Chair of the UN Permanent Forum of Indigenous Issues when the Declaration was adopted, and is currently the UN . In this interview, conducted via email, she explains why the Declaration is so important, argues that governments are failing to implement it, and claims that the struggle for indigenous rights ※surpasses§ other great social movements of the past: DH: Why is the UN Declaration so important? VTC: [It＊s] so important because it enshrines and affirms the inherent or pre-existing collective human rights of Indigenous Peoples, as well as the individual human rights of indigenous persons. It is a framework for justice and reconciliation between Indigenous Peoples and states, and applies international human rights standards to the specific historical, cultural, social and economic circumstances of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration is a standard-setting resolution of profound significance as it reflects a wide consensus at the global level on the minimum content of the rights of indigenous peoples. It is a remedial tool which addresses the need to overcome and repair the historical denial of the fundamental human rights of indigenous peoples, and affirms their equality to all other members of society. DH: How significant an achievement was it? VTC: In the 1970s Indigenous Peoples had brought to the UN＊s attention the problems and issues they were facing, which led the UN to establish the Working Group on Indigenous Populations in 1982. This was mandated to listen to the developments in indigenous territories and to draft a declaration on their rights. The drafting started in 1985 and Indigenous Peoples took an active part. When the Working Group finished its draft in 1995, it was brought to the Commission on Human Rights where the intergovernmental negotiations took place. On the first day, the Chair of the Intergovernmental Working Group told Indigenous Peoples that we weren＊t allowed to speak at the negotiations - only to observe. We walked out, of course, because we could not accept and respect a declaration on our rights made without our participation. This led to a change in the UN rules and we were allowed to take part. It was during my term as Chair of the UN Permanent Forum that the Declaration was adopted. There was a real concern that [that would never happen], or that it would be watered down, but finally in September 2007 we were able to achieve this important victory.DH: How has the Declaration helped indigenous peoples to date?VTC: Its adoption has boosted the confidence and commitment of many Indigenous Peoples to sustain and strengthen their movements to assert and claim their rights, especially to their lands, territories, resources and self-determination, which includes the right to have their free, prior and informed consent obtained when projects are brought to their lands. I would daresay that Indigenous Peoples＊ movements in many countries, regions and even the global movement gained more strength after the Declaration＊s adoption. It has made Indigenous Peoples＊ rights issues more visible and discussed during global processes, such as the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development Goals. Unfortunately, even if the UN＊s member states adopted the Declaration, most have not been able to implement it effectively. There has been limited progress. Many Indigenous Peoples are still being dispossessed of their lands by states and corporations, and are being criminalised and assassinated when they fight to protect their lands from being grabbed and polluted by mining and oil companies. The Declaration remains the main tool to fight these battles. In some cases, these battles are being won.DH: When you talk about ※implementation§, do you mean it being respected as a Declaration or made ? Are there any countries where attempts to do the latter have made serious progress?VTC: Implementation means that states will amend their constitutions and adopt a national law to protect and respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples which are consistent with the standards established in the Declaration. Effective implementation requires states to develop an ambitious program of reforms to remedy past and current injustices. It involves all branches of the state, executive, judiciary, and legislative, and implies a combination of political will, legal reform, technical capacity, and financial commitments. Several countries have taken the significant step of passing such laws or enshrining recognition of Indigenous Peoples＊ rights in their constitutions, such as Bolivia, Brazil and Ecuador, among others. Brazil was an early leader in this regard and has titled over 100 million hectares of indigenous land, but we are now seeing this progress threatened by the current administration. Latin America has historically been the strongest with regard to recognising indigenous land rights - yet many countries now face potential roll-back. The Declaration doesn＊t have to be made legally binding for it to be implemented effectively. DH: Do you think the Declaration could be improved? Or is there anything in it you would be critical of?VTC: No, I don＊t think the Declaration has to be improved. It is not a perfect document, but it is the result of more than two decades of drafting and negotiating until Indigenous Peoples and states agreed that it was acceptable. Every article represents a response to some of the human rights violations and injustices suffered by Indigenous Peoples. . . We fought to be called ※Indigenous Peoples§, a title that recognises us as distinct with our own identities and cultures. We fought for the inclusion of free, prior and informed consent. The biggest problem [with the Declaration] is a lack of implementation. Indigenous Peoples are still forced from their lands for development and conservation projects, and still face violence and criminalisation when they stand up for their rights.DH: What did you think of the ? Were you surprised?VTC: I was very glad to hear the Pope＊s comments on the right to free, prior and informed consent and his recognition that our lands are vital to our identities, values and spirituality. His words inspire hope for Indigenous Peoples facing an uphill struggle. The Pope also recognised the importance of indigenous rights in the global struggle against climate change: when Indigenous Peoples＊ rights to their lands are protected, they are the best guardians of the world＊s forests and biodiversity. Studies show that where Indigenous Peoples have secure rights to their lands, carbon storage is higher and deforestation is lower.DH: In your time as Rapporteur you＊ve visited many countries and spoken to many indigenous peoples around the world. What has been the most distressing trip you＊ve made so far? VTC: Around the world, Indigenous Peoples face escalating attacks as well as arrests for refusing to give up the lands they have called home since time immemorial. Seeing evidence of this violence on my visits has been particularly distressing. When I visited indigenous communities in Brazil last year, they showed me the scars on their bodies from rubber bullets and the graves of their murdered leaders. I later found out that some of the communities I visited were attacked only hours after I left. I have seen evidence of this violence in many countries. In the last year alone I communicated my concerns to governments about these attacks in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Tanzania and the United States.DH: And what has been your most inspiring trip? VTC: What inspires me the most is the firm determination of indigenous peoples to fight for their rights. Also, their capacity to survive and their high levels of resilience in the face of great difficulties. DH: You＊ve mentioned some of the threats and challenges that indigenous peoples have to deal with. Very briefly, what do you think are the biggest threats? VTC: I think the biggest threats are extractive industries, conservation projects and climate change. Many Indigenous Peoples live on resource-rich territory - in large part because they have protected and preserved that land for generations - making them prime targets for both extractive industries and protected areas. Despite the fact that the UN Declaration has been accepted as an international norm, international law still heavily privileges investors and companies. Also, as I found in my report to the [UN] General Assembly last year, protected areas are still being established on indigenous lands without their consent, even though Indigenous Peoples are the proven best guardians of the forest and forcing them from their lands does not improve environmental outcomes. Finally, Indigenous Peoples often live in areas at increased risk of climate change-related disasters. I have already heard from Indigenous Peoples in Kiribati whose homes have been lost to rising seas. Unfortunately, even the solutions to climate change, such as wind farms and geothermal energy, can sometimes threaten indigenous land rights. Where Indigenous Peoples＊ rights are ignored, they face the loss of their lands, livelihoods, sacred sites and self-governance.DH: What do you think of the mainstream media＊s portrayal of indigenous peoples? VTC: I think that there has been an increase in media coverage over the years. I＊m glad to see less coverage that portrays us as primitive, but sometimes the media fails to capture the fact that we are not anti-development. We are also seeing more media coverage - but still not enough - on the contributions of Indigenous Peoples to global goals on climate, poverty and peace. If Indigenous Peoples＊ rights are not secured and protected, it will be impossible for the world to deliver on the promises of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. Secure land rights for Indigenous Peoples is a proven climate change solution, and denying indigenous land rights and self-determination is a threat to the world＊s remaining forests and biodiversity. It is also a primary cause of poverty. Many indigenous communities face intractable poverty despite living on resource-rich lands because their rights are not respected and their self-determined development is not supported. Protecting the rights of indigenous women, who are often responsible for both their communities＊ food security and for managing their forests, is particularly important. Finally, undocumented land rights are a primary cause of conflict and a threat to investment in developing countries. Securing their rights can help mitigate these conflicts and create a more peaceful world.DH: Finally, do you think the struggle for indigenous peoples＊ rights and territories is comparable to any of the other great social movements in the past? VTC: I think the Indigenous Peoples＊ movement surpasses other social movements. They have struggled against colonisation for more than 500 years and continue against forms of colonisation and racism. At the same time, they continue to construct and reconstruct their communities and practice their cultural values of collectivity, solidarity with nature, and reciprocity even amidst serious challenges. Many still fight to protect their territories, which makes their movement different from others. "

"Oil giants , Shell, BP and Total are among a group of large corporations supporting a plan to tax carbon dioxide emissions in order to address climate change.The companies have revealed their support for the , a group of senior Republican figures  as part of a ※free-market, limited government§ response to climate change.The fossil fuel companies announced their backing for the plan alongside other major firms including Unilever, PepsiCo, General Motors and Johnson & Johnson., the companies called for a ※consensus climate solution that bridges partisan divides, strengthens our economy and protects our shared environment§. Exxon and the others were listed as founding members of the plan, alongside the green groups Conservation International and the Nature Conservancy.※Climate change is already impacting our communities, our economy and our environment and those impacts will continue to grow and become worse if we don＊t act now,§ said Mark Tercek, chief executive of the Nature Conservancy. ※We can＊t afford to wait to have these conversations.§However, other green groups dismissed the plan as a stunt designed to insulate fossil fuel companies that have sought to undermine or dismiss the science of global warming.※ExxonMobil will try to dress this up as climate activism, but its key agenda is protecting executives from legal accountability for climate pollution and fraud,§ said Naomi Ages, senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace USA. ※A nicely worded public relations exercise is no cure for decades of deception.§Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, said his had been ※encouraged by the proposal put forth by the Climate Leadership Council as it aligns closely with our longstanding principles§, and would work to develop the policy.The plan was crafted by a group of conservative elder statesmen that includes former Republican secretaries of state James Baker and George Shultz and Hank Paulson, a former secretary of the treasury. Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, and the physicist Stephen Hawking are also members of the group.Under the proposal, a $40 carbon tax, rising over time, would be levied on emissions in order to encourage a shift towards renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. All of the proceeds from the tax would be returned to the American public via ※carbon dividends§ 每 the group estimates a family of four would receive a payment of $2,000 in the first year. As further tradeoff for the new tax, the plan would dismantle all major climate regulations, including the Environmental Protection Agency＊s authority over CO2 emissions and an ※outright repeal§ of the clean power plan.Exxon,  and Shell recently voiced support for the Paris climate agreement before Donald Trump＊s decision to withdraw the US from the pact. All three companies have acknowledged that climate change is real and poses an economic and societal threat.However, this is the first time they have all publicly backed a price on carbon. Exxon has come closest to doing so in the past, with Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive who is now secretary of state,  that a ※carbon tax strikes me as a more direct, a more transparent and a more effective approach§ than other systems., including most of Europe, China and South Africa, have a price on carbon or a plan to do so. In the US, California has an emissions trading scheme, which is linked to a similar initiative in the Canadian province of Quebec.Barack Obama failed to implement a national market-based response to climate change early in his presidency and the chances of the US doing so are now even slimmer under a Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress that is reflexively suspicious of any new tax.However, backers of the Climate Leadership Council hope that strengthening public support for carbon taxes, along with growing concern over sea level rise, droughts and heatwaves, will start to erode the decade-long impasse in US climate policy."																																																			
"Nearly a third of the world＊s population is now exposed to climatic conditions that produce deadly heatwaves, as the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere makes it ※almost inevitable§ that vast areas of the planet will face rising fatalities from high temperatures, new research has found. has escalated the heatwave risk across the globe, the study states, with nearly half of the world＊s population set to suffer periods of deadly heat by the end of the century even if greenhouse gases are radically cut.※For heatwaves, our options are now between bad or terrible,§ said Camilo Mora, an academic at the University of Hawaii and lead author of the study.High temperatures are currently baking large swaths of the south-western US, with the  (NWS) issuing an  for Phoenix, Arizona, which is set to reach 119F (48.3C) on Monday. The heat warning extends across much of Arizona and up through the heart of California, with Palm Springs forecast a toasty 116F (46.6C) on Monday and Sacramento set to reach 107F (41.6C). The NWS warned the abnormal warmth would ※significantly increase the potential for heat-related illness§ and advised residents to drink more water, seek shade and recognize the early symptoms of heat stroke, such as nausea and a racing pulse. Mora＊s research shows that the overall risk of heat-related illness or death has climbed steadily since 1980, with around 30% of the world＊s population now living in climatic conditions that deliver deadly temperatures at least 20 days a year. The proportion of people at risk worldwide will grow to 48% by 2100 even if emissions are drastically reduced, while around three-quarters of the global population will be under threat by then if greenhouse gases are not curbed at all.※Finding so many cases of heat-related deaths was mind blowing, especially as they often don＊t get much attention because they last for just a few days and then people moved on,§ Mora said.※Dying in a heatwave is like being slowly cooked, it＊s pure torture. The young and elderly are at particular risk, but we found that this heat can kill soldiers, athletes, everyone.§, analyzed more than 1,900 cases of fatalities associated with heatwaves in 36 countries over the past four decades. By looking at heat and humidity during such lethal episodes, researchers worked out a threshold beyond which conditions become deadly.This time period includes the European heatwave of 2003, which fueled forest fires in several countries and caused the River Danube in Serbia to plummet so far that submerged second world war tanks and bombs were revealed. An estimated 20,000 people died; a  suggested the number was as high as 70,000. A further 10,000 died in Moscow due to scorching weather in 2010. In 1995, Chicago suffered a five-day burst of heat that resulted in more than 700 deaths.However, most heat-related deaths do not occur during such widely-covered disasters. Phoenix, for example, suffered an unusually hot spell last June that resulted in the deaths of at least four people. Hyperthermia, an excess of body heat, can lead to heat stroke and a potential inflammatory response that can kill. Mora said the threshold to deadly conditions caries from place to place, with some people dying in temperatures as low as 23C. A crucial factor, he said, was the humidity level combined with the heat.※Your sweat doesn＊t evaporate if it is very humid, so heat accumulates in your body instead,§ Mora said. ※People can then suffer heat toxicity, which is like sunburn on the inside of your body. The blood rushes to the skin to cool you down so there＊s less blood going to the organs. A common killer is when the lining of your gut breaks down and leaks toxins into the rest of your body.§Global warming is a potent instigator of deadly heat, with  finding the probability of a heatwave killing in excess of 100 people in India has doubled due to a 0.5C increase in temperature over the past 50 years. ※The impact of global climate change is not a specter on the horizon. It＊s real, and it＊s being felt now all over the planet,§ said Amir AghaKouchak, UCI associate professor and co-author of that study. ※It＊s particularly alarming that the adverse effects are pummeling the world＊s most vulnerable populations.§Elevated temperatures and dry conditions have been exacerbated by the clearing of trees, which provide shade and cooling moisture, in urban areas. Mora said that while adaption such as government heat warnings and the increased use of air conditioning has helped reduce deaths, this was not a viable long-term solution.※The heat means that we are becoming prisoners in our own homes 每 you go to Houston, Texas in the summer and there＊s no-one outside,§ he said. ※Also, the increased use of air conditioning means that electrical grids fail, as has happened in New York City, Australia and Saudi Arabia. We need to prevent heatwaves rather than just trying to adapt to them.§"																																																			
"The Ganges river, considered sacred by more than 1 billion Indians, has become the first non-human entity in  to be granted the same legal rights as people.A court in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand ordered on Monday that the Ganges and its main tributary, the Yamuna, be accorded the status of living human entities.The decision, which was welcomed by environmentalists, means that polluting or damaging the rivers will be legally equivalent to harming a person.The judges cited the , revered by the indigenous M芋ori people, which was declared a living entity with full legal rights by the New Zealand government last week.Judges Rajeev Sharma and Alok Singh said the Ganges and Yamuna rivers and their tributaries would be ※legal and living entities having the status of a legal person with all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities§.The court in the Himalayan resort town of Nainital appointed three officials to act as legal custodians responsible for conserving and protecting the rivers and their tributaries. It ordered that a management board be established within three months.The case arose after officials complained that the state governments of Uttarakhand and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh were not cooperating with federal government efforts to set up a panel to protect the Ganges.Himanshu Thakkar, an engineer who coordinates the South Asia Network on Dams,  and People, said the practical implications of the decision were not clear.※There are already 1.5bn litres of untreated sewage entering the river each day, and 500m litres of industrial waste,§ he said.※All of this will become illegal with immediate effect, but you can＊t stop the discharge immediately. So how this decision pans out in terms of practical reality is very unclear.§Indian courts have been critical of three decades of government efforts to clean up the Ganges, a 2,500km waterway named after the Hindu goddess Ganga. The latest cleanup initiative has set 2018 as its deadline, one that water ministry officials have  is unlikely to be met. Thakkar said Monday＊s decision could be an effort by courts to broaden their scope for intervention in the river＊s management. ※[The] government has been trying to clean up the river by spending a lot of money, putting in a lot of infrastructure and technology, but they aren＊t looking at the governance of the river,§ he said.He gave the example of the Yamuna, which is monitored by 22 sewage treatment plants in Delhi. ※But none of them are functioning according to their design in terms of quantity and quality, and we don＊t know the reason,§ he said.※You need a simple management system for each of the plants and give independent people the mandate to inspect them, question the officials and have them write daily and quarterly reports so that lessons are actually learned.§Environmental activists say many rivers in India have become dirtier as the economy has developed, with city sewage, farming pesticides and industrial effluents freely flowing into waterways despite laws against polluting.The Yamuna is the main tributary of the Ganges that officials say is tainted with sewage and industrial pollution. In some places, the river has stagnated to the point that it no longer supports life. Water from the Yamuna is treated chemically before being supplied to Delhi＊s nearly 19 million residents as drinking water.In New Zealand, the local M芋ori , or tribe, of Whanganui in the North Island had fought for the recognition of their river 每 the third largest in New Zealand 每 as an ancestor for 140 years.Last Wednesday, hundreds of tribal representatives wept with joy when their attempt to have their kin awarded legal status as a living entity was passed into law.※We have fought to find an approximation in law so that all others can understand that, from our perspective, treating the river as a living entity is the correct way to approach it, as an indivisible whole, instead of the traditional model for the last 100 years of treating it from a perspective of ownership and management,§ said Gerrard Albert, the lead negotiator for the ."																																																			
"Ethiopia＊s highlands also host a unique treasure trove of wild coffee varieties, meaning new flavour profiles and growing traits could be lost before having been discovered. However, the new research also reveals that if a massive programme of moving plantations up hillsides to cooler altitudes were feasible, coffee production could actually increase.Coffee vies with tea as the world＊s favourite beverage and employs 100 million people worldwide in farming the beans alone. But climate change is coffee＊s greatest long-term threat, killing plantations or reducing bean quality and allowing the deadly coffee leaf rust fungus to thrive. Without major action both in the coffee industry and in slashing greenhouse gas emissions, .The research combined climate-change computer modelling with detailed measurements of current ground conditions, gathered in fieldwork that covered a total distance of 30,000km within Ethiopia. It found that 40-60% of today＊s coffee growing areas in Ethiopia would be unsuitable by the end of the century under a range of likely warming scenarios.But the study, , also shows that major relocation programmes could preserve or even expand the country＊s coffee-growing areas. ※There is a pathway to resilience, even under climate change,§ said Aaron Davis, at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in the UK, who conducted the work with Ethiopian scientists. ※But it is a hugely daunting task. Millions of farmers would have to change.§However, by 2040, such moves uphill will have reached the top of Ethiopia＊s mountains. ※It literally reaches the ceiling, because you don＊t have any higher place to go,§ Davis said. The impacts of global warming are already being seen as temperatures have been rising steadily in Ethiopia for decades. Farmers report a longer, more extreme dry season and more intense rain in the wet season, with good harvests much less frequent than in their parents and grandparents＊ time. One famous coffee location likely to be lost is Harar. ※In one area, there are hundreds if not thousands of hectares of dead trees,§ said Davis. ※It is a world renowned name and has been grown in that area for many centuries. But under all [climate change] scenarios, it＊s going to get worse.※Some of the origins, what you would call terroir in the wine industry, will disappear, unless serious intervention is undertaken,§ he said. ※It would be like losing the Burgundy wine region. Those areas are found nowhere else but Ethiopia, and because of the genetic diversity, the diversity of flavour profiles is globally unique.§Both arabica and robusta coffee originated in Ethiopia and wild arabica plants are virtually unknown outside the country. The wild arabica varieties may well harbour traits for disease and drought resistance that could prove vital for the future health of coffee crops. Prof Sebsebe Demissew, from the University of Addis Ababa and one of the research team, said: ※Coffee originates from the highland forests of Ethiopia, and it is our gift to the world. As Ethiopia is the main natural storehouse of arabica genetic diversity, what happens in Ethiopia could have long-term impacts for coffee farming globally.§The new research is a ※brilliant piece of work§, according to Tim Schilling, chief executive of the  programme: ※This is the only comprehensive, country-specific study I have seen that uses some of the best methods in climate modelling coupled to very rigorous ground-truthing 每 extremely useful for governments and industry and a model to be repeated.§Schilling led an expedition into South Sudan in 2013 to confirm wild arabica coffee was also present in the Boma forest: ※What we found was major degradation caused by climate change on the forest and the wild coffee under its canopy. That is pretty much what I think we can expect if nothing is done to preserve the arabica genetic treasure chest in Ethiopia.§Schilling said new varieties and growing methods must be developed and that plantation ※migration will have to be part of a plan B§. He added: ※Plan C might be moving up in latitude and growing coffee in Southern France and Texas!§ But he said funding all this is difficult when coffee producers are not making much money at present.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 2014: ※The overall predictions are for a reduction in area suitable for coffee production by 2050 in all countries studied. In many cases, the area suitable for production would decrease considerably with increases of temperature of only 2-2.5C.§ It said that in Brazil, the world＊s biggest coffee producer, a temperature rise of 3C would slash the area suitable for coffee by two-thirds in the principal growing states. In 2016, other researchers predicted .※People should also be thinking about the millions of smallholder farmers who put their coffee on the table,§ said Davis. ※The coffee farmers of Ethiopia are really on the frontline [of climate change] 每 they are the people who will pay the price first. In the longer term, the only truly sustainable solution is to combat the root causes of climate change.§"																																																			
"Widely used insecticides damage the survival of honeybee colonies, the world＊s largest ever field trial has shown for the first time, as well as harming wild bees.The farm-based research, along with a second new study, also suggests widespread contamination of entire landscapes and a toxic ※cocktail effect§ from multiple pesticides. The landmark work provides the most important evidence yet for regulators around the world considering action against neonicotinoids, including in the EU where a  this autumn. The insecticides are currently banned on flowering crops in the EU.The negative impacts found varied across different countries, leading the pesticide manufacturers to question whether the results of the research, which they funded, were real. The new research is . Neonicotinoids represent a quarter of the multi-billion dollar pesticide market but have been repeatedly linked to serious harm in bees in lab-based studies. Bees and other pollinators are vital to food production but are in decline, in part due to loss of habitats and disease. But there had been few realistic field studies to date to address the role of the insecticides and only  in wild bees.The new research took place at 33 large farmland sites spread across the UK, Germany and Hungary. Honeybees, bumblebees and solitary bees living by insecticide-treated fields of oil seed rape were compared with those in fields where insecticides were not used in the year of the study. The survival of honeybee colonies was reduced by exposure to the insecticides in the UK and Hungary, but not in Germany, where the bees foraged far less on oil seed rape and had lower levels of disease. The reproductive success of the wild bees was cut as the insecticide exposure increased in all three countries.※We showed significant negative effects at critical life cycle stages,§ said Prof Richard Pywell, from the UK＊s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), and part of the research team. ※If the bees are foraging a lot on oil seed rape, they are clearly at risk. This is a large and important piece of evidence, but it is not the only evidence regulators will look at.§Scientists not involved in the research backed the conclusions. ※Together, the two studies make strong contributions to the growing scientific consensus about the harms of neonicotinoid pesticides to bees,§ said Prof James Nieh, at the University of California San Diego. Addressing the differences between countries, Prof Jeremy Kerr, at the University of Ottawa in Canada, said: ※Neonicotinoid applications are a kind of reproductive roulette for bees. Depending on local environmental characteristics, they can materially reduce survival prospects.§The $3m cost of the research was met by Syngenta and Bayer, the companies that sell the two neonicotinoids tested, as part of a voluntary commitment to increase the available field data. But the companies were not involved in the designing, conducting or reporting of the study.It found that the bees in Germany got just 15% of their food from the oil seed rape fields, compared to 40-50% in the UK and Hungary. ※Clearly the bees in Germany are feeding on other flower resources in the landscape and are less exposed to neonics,§ said Pywell.The scientists also discovered that the wild bees were exposed to a neonicotinoid that was not even used in the trial and concluded the harm caused may result from ※persistent residues in arable systems due to their widespread and often very frequent use§.However, both Bayer and Syngenta expressed doubt about the ※simplistic§ interpretation of complex and ※inconsistent§ results. ※We do not share CEH＊s interpretation and remain confident that neonicotinoids are safe when used responsibly§ said Richard Schmuck, director of environmental safety at Bayer CropScience.Peter Campbell, from Syngenta, said: ※The negative and positive results reported by CEH could easily be random, ie not real.§ He said even taking the results at face value ※demonstrates that neonics can be used safely or even with benefit to bees under certain circumstances, such as reported in Germany.§But CEH＊s Pywell said: ※We stand by our peer-reviewed paper. We undertook the statistical analysis and reported the findings as we saw them and those are underpinned by the data. We are absolutely independent.§The second new , carried out on corn farms in Canada, also found crops were not the main source of neonicotinoids to which bees were exposed. Instead, the contaminated pollen came from wildflowers, as has been shown recently in the UK. ※This indicates that neonicotinoids, which are water soluble, spill over from fields into the surrounding environment, where they are taken up by other plants that are very attractive to bees,§ said Nadia Tsvetkov, at York University in Canada and who led the research.※The detection of the potential long-term persistence of neonicotinoids in the soil by both studies raises the spectre of a reprise of ,§ said Prof Robert Paxton at Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany. The Canadian research also found that the presence of realistic levels of a fungicide made the neonicotinoids twice as toxic to bees. ※The effect of neonicotinoids on honey bees quickly turns from bad to worse when you add the fungicide boscalid to the mix,§ said Prof Val谷rie Fournier, at Laval University in Canada and also part of the team.  are not tested in combination by regulators and Kerr said: ※This study shows that mixtures matter.§Environmental campaigners said the new research exposed the full impact of neonicotinoids. ※The horror story is clear: we have contaminated our land and water with persistent neonicotinoid pesticides,§ said Matt Shardlow, CEO of the charity Buglife. ※This major study marks a watershed moment in the fight to protect our bees [and] fills a crucial gap in our scientific understanding,§ said Greenpeace UK＊s chief scientist Doug Parr. ※The case for a permanent ban on these pesticides is now unassailable, and our politicians will have to take action.§But Guy Smith, from the National Farmers Union in Britain said neonicotinoids were important in protecting crops and producing food: ※We strongly believe that policy decisions 每 such as restricting the use of neonicotinoids 每 must be based on sound science which gives strong evidence. And while this CEH study provides more useful information, we still don＊t have that definitive evidence for the impact of neonicotinoids.§Prof David Goulson, a bee expert at the University of Sussex, UK, said: ※In the light of these new studies, continuing to claim that use of neonicotinoids in farming does not harm bees is no longer a tenable position. In my view we should also consider the bigger picture; the current model of farming based on huge monocultures treated with dozens of pesticides is causing devastating environmental harm, undermining vital ecosystem services that keep us all alive.§"																																																			
"Professor Lewis＊s analysis of ways to tackle air pollution (, theguardian.com, 15 February) is disappointingly dismissive of technology that can work in bus shelters or other pollution hotspots. While these solutions can＊t clean an entire atmosphere, there are places where they can make a huge difference and it would be shortsighted to sweep them aside. have independently verified that our technology can clean the air of dangerous and pervasive nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter in pollution hotspots. It can reduce exposure to pollution in bus shelters, tube stations, and potentially hospitals or schools, by up to 80%. The mixing of the atmosphere does not therefore ※completely outweigh the benefits§ as Professor Lewis claims.The UK＊s repeated breach of legal air pollution limits has been widely reported, with costs to public health estimated at ?20bn a year. As UK cities grapple with how to reduce air pollution, they should explore technology like ours, which can reduce harmful exposure and improve the health of their citizens. The next step for this technology is a large-scale pilot 每 perhaps at a tube or bus station. We are willing to fund that pilot; we just need a willing host and partner.r"
