A White House staff salary document shows that 22 of President Trump's aides, including some of the best-known to the public, are earning $179,700.

A presidential assistant for intragovernmental and technology initiatives, Reed Cordish, is also going unpaid. He too comes from a real estate family. Other aides such as top economic adviser Gary Cohn, formerly a top executive at Goldman Sachs, are working at a steep discount of $30,000. The White House has been required to report the salaries and staff titles to Congress every year since 1995. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.
