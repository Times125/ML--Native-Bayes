PRAGUE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Defence Ministry wants to invest 500 million crowns (about 20 million U.S. dollars) annually in the state protection against cyber attacks in the next five years, a senior official said on Thursday. Addressing a conference on cyber security, Deputy Defence Minister Daniel Kostoval said the money will be spent on the purchase of technologies, recruiting staff and their education. The sum is supposed to be even higher in the future. In the Czech Republic, the need to strengthen the state's ability in fighting against cyber threats has been discussed for a period of time. In addition to passive defense, the security forces would be able to avert the threat of cyber attack, said Kostoval. He said that it is necessary to include the cyber dimension into other areas where a war is led. According to him, the state must be able to protect its cyberspace and to attack the enemy's weapons systems on the battlefield and gain control over it. Czech National Security Office (NBU) head Dusan Navratil said that the Czech Republic must gain an offensive advantage over the adversary. It must be able to avert cyberattacks with its own means. In case of a threat, the hackers used by the state could attack the enemy using cyber means even on his own territory. Kostoval said that Czech Republic could, if it targeted the cyber security, be one of the best countries in this field. He said that the Czech Republic is now "in the mainstream, and not on the fringes" of cyber security. (1 U.S. dollar = 25 Crowns)
