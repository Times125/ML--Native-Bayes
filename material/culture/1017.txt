What is Darren AronofskyïŒs new movie Mother! about? He doesnïŒt want to tell you. Or rather, he wants to tell you that he doesnïŒt want to tell you. In recent interviews Aronofsky has insisted he wants to keep the details of the film secret, before going on to describe it as â»a cruise missile shooting into a wallÂ§, â»a very intense rideÂ§, with â»home-invasion elementsÂ§ and other such hints, just in case you thought it might be a sequel to .â»SecrecyÂ§ is a pretty elastic term when it comes to the movies. Many a film-maker has become obsessive about keeping everything under wraps æ¯ usually the type whose movies hinge on grand mysteries and twists. ItïŒs standard practice to swear casts to silence and guard scripts as if theyïŒre nuclear codes.  one page of information about Interstellar when he commissioned him to do the score, for example. Someone who worked on James CameronïŒs Avatar told me the non-disclosure agreement was the size of a telephone book, and contained the phrase â»in this universe or any otherÂ§ æ¯ and they probably werenïŒt even allowed to disclose that.But at the same time, they want us to know about the movie, donïŒt they? So â»secrecyÂ§ has become part of the marketing strategy. Years ahead of release, we dutifully follow the trail of clues: an on-set Instagram here, a cryptic fansite interview there, a 30-second teaser trailer, maybe some preview footage æ¯ each giving away a precisely calibrated amount of new information to keep us speculating and salivating. Often such snippets spoil the movieïŒs surprises entirely. Often there wasnïŒt much to spoil anyway. The promotion has become the real mystery thriller; the eventual movie is merely a summing up of the case.This is probably all Alfred HitchcockïŒs fault. He knew the suspense game began long before the movieïŒs release. He bought up all the copies of the novel on which Psycho was based, so nobody would know the plot twists. He informed viewers that â»no oneïŒ BUT NO ONEïŒ will be admitted to the theatre after the start of each performanceÂ§, and warned them not to give away PsychoïŒs secrets. For good measure, though, Hitchcock also recorded a six-minute prologue, touring the movieïŒs locations like a squeamish estate agent. â»TheyïŒve cleaned all this up now,Â§ he says, inspecting Janet LeighïŒs bathroom. Yet Psycho still delivered the promised shock.LetïŒs hope  does too, because AronofskyïŒs comments and the latest trailer already give away far too much.
