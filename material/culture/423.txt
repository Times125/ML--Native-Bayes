his low-key first feature from Lebanese director Vatche Boulghourjian centres on a blind musician named Rabih (Barakat Jabbour, quite captivating), who goes on a -style road trip after discovering that the truth of his ancestry?has been kept from him by his mother, Samar?(Julia Kassar). Just as Rabih searches for?his buried heritage, Boulghourjian also seeks to uncover the history of his country s deep national trauma in the wake of the civil war.
