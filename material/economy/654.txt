The  governor, Mark Carney, has fallen victim to an online prankster who got him to joke about one of his predecessor s supposed drinking habits.Carney was caught out by the same hoaxer who .The prankster, who uses the Twitter handle , emailed Carney from a Hotmail account pretending to be Anthony Habgood, the chair of the Bank s court. In the exchange, posted on Twitter, Carney appears initially to fall for the prank and tentatively accepts an invitation to a  soiree  in June. But the governor is quick to dismiss his correspondent s message as  not appropriate at all  when the impostor claims to have engaged some  rather dashing bar ladies  for the evening.The Bank declined to comment on the exchange. It has insisted in the past that it takes online security very seriously but the prank on the nation s top central banker may raise questions about whether more precautions should be taken.While the prankster got a swift slapdown for his sexist comments, he did manage to draw the Canadian banker on the topic of morning drinking.According to the exchange as posted on Twitter, the prankster used anthonyhabgood@hotmail.com and wrote under the subject line  I see reports of Jane Austen in the papers today :Carney replied: The comment was probably a reference to  by the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, in which he told the Observer that at lunches, the former Bank of England governor Eddie George  would start with a martini, never eat vegetables and incredibly good clarets would appear from the vaults .Carney appeared to exercise more caution than Staley, who responded to emails sent by a  John McFarlane , the name of the  chairman.The email exchange showed Staley being told  you owe me a large Scotch  after the bank s difficult annual general meeting,  over the latter s attempts to unmask a whistleblower who had been making allegations about the previous conduct of a new recruit in the US.In the exchange, Staley appeared to lavish praise on McFarlane, who was instrumental in hiring the American chief executive in 2015.
