Former White House press secretary  made a surprising appearance during Sunday night s Emmys, mocking his former boss s obsession with crowd sizes during host Stephen Colbert s opening monologue.Colbert, who regularly takes aim at Trump on The Late Show, used his opening monologue to make fun of Trump, who during a presidential debate last year said he  should ve won  an Emmy when his show The Apprentice was nominated. If he d won, I bet he would not have run for president,  Colbert told the crowd.  So, in a way this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised anti-heroes,  Colbert added, referencing the character Walter White of Breaking Bad and calling Trump, along with Alec Baldwin,  the biggest TV star of this past year .Then, Spicer stepped on to the stage with a podium that looked identical to the one he delivered his often confusing briefings from as press secretary. The  crowd, including Melissa McCarthy, whose infamous impression of Spicer made waves earlier this year, was noticeably surprised. This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period! Both in person and around the world!  Spicer joked. Wow! That really soothes my fragile ego,  Colbert joked in response.
