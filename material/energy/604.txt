Indian billionaire Gautam Adani has given the  green light  to the Carmichael mine and rail project, but it will still hinge on its Australian arm, Adani , gaining bank backing for the contentious venture.Adani s top executive in Australia, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, took a dig at  activists who sit in creature comfort and criticise us  while trumpeting the decision to invest in Australia s largest proposed coalmine.The company is yet to secure its bid for a  from the federal governmentfor a railway that would help other miners open up Queensland s Galilee Basin.Adani said the  final investment decision  by Adani Mining s Indian parent marked  the official start of one of the largest single infrastructure   and job creating   developments in Australia s recent history .Janakaraj, the chief executive of Adani Mining said the company was delivering on its promise to  address power poverty for hundreds of millions in India and unacceptably high unemployment in regional Queensland . To those activists who sit in creature comfort and criticise us, I ask a simple question   what are you doing for those people? Adani said the company was committed to  the largest single investment by an Indian corporation in Australia  despite opposition from the environmental movement. We have been challenged by activists in the courts, in inner city streets, and even outside banks that have not even been approached to finance the project,  he said.Adani noted the company was  still facing activists . He said the project would generate  10,000 direct and indirect jobs . This is a projection from a form of economic modelling that Queensland s top bureacrat, the co-ordinator general, Barry Broe, has since said should  not be used in isolation  when forecasting for major projects because .The  land court has heard that the project would generate 1,464 net jobs   accounting for jobs in other mines and industries it would displace   based on more rigorous  computable general equilibrium  modelling.Broe in April  following lobbying by the Environmental Defenders Office of Queensland in the wake of what it said were  exaggerated  jobs claims by Adani and .Julien Vincent, the executive director of environmental finance group Market Finance described the announcement as  little more than a PR stunt . Announcing an intention to invest is a far cry from having the finance to do so,  Vincent said.He said the Indian parent company Adani Enterprises, with estimated net debt of $2.5bn, was  yet to raise a single cent of the $5bn required to capitalise the project .But Adani had little choice but to pursue the project because  failure would mean a write-down equivalent to around half the value of the company , he said.Vincent said:  The investment decision we really need to worry about is that of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, which may be about an announce a $900m loan to Adani on behalf of the Australian public. David Barnden, a lawyer at Environmental Justice Australia, said Adani s mine was  far from a certainty .He said Adani s application for a Naif loan faced  procedural and constitutional hurdles  and some backlash from taxpayers, at a time when major Australian banks were  shunning new coal mines  in line with the paris agreement. The premier, , told reporters in Townsville, where Adani opened its regional headquarters on Tuesday, she was  very pleased  with the announcement. What we are seeing with the opening of this office, is a real presence on the ground here in Townsville, and a strong signal that this project is committed to regional Queensland,  she said.The Queensland treasurer, Curtis Pitt, was asked about his belief in the prospects of Adani gaining finance at Queensland media club lunch in Brisbane. Pitt responded by saying the state government encouraged the Commonwealth to  get on with the job of putting money at the door  under the Naif.He said the  biggest customer for that mine is the Indian government, with their approach to try and support growth in the Indian economy .Pitt said there had been  a lot of speculation  about .But the investment decision showed the government had been able to  reassure the Adani group  of its commitments, including on royalties and approvals, Pitt said.Guardian Australia has been told Adani can defer royalty payments in the first five years under a less accommodating proposal than an earlier one that could have seen up to $320m in payments deferred.It is understood Adani has agreed to pay at least $5m in royalties in the first year, with minimum payments sliding up to the full amount in the fifth year and interest charged on any royalties deferred.Nikola Casule, a climate and energy campaigner with Greenpeace Australia, said the mine would be  a disaster for the climate, the Great Barrier Reef and frontline communities in Queensland and around the world .Helen Szoke, the chief executive of Oxfam Australia, said the project would not help  energy poverty  but  drive more people into poverty through the devastating consequences of climate change and the direct toll of coal burning on local communities .
