Consumers failed to propel the UK economy in the first quarter as rising prices dampened appetite for spending, official figures will show this week.City economists believe the Office for National Statistics will confirm on Thursday that  from 0.7% in the previous quarter.The second estimate of GDP growth provides a more detailed breakdown of how the economy performed, including a first take on consumer spending.Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, said the detail was likely to confirm that the first quarter was  a very soft period  for household spending, following decent growth of 0.7% in the previous quarter.He said a consumer slowdown was likely to weigh on the wider economy, which grew by 1.8% in 2016.
