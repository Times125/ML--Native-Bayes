The BFSI sector is growing far beyond the traditional method and is improving the spectrum of services & customer experience. The growth in terrorism, physical, and cyber-attacks (2016 attack which led to compromise 3.2 million debit card holders in India), the incidence of ransomware attack intruding the systems in around 150 countries are some of the major reasons driving the change in the BFSI industry and necessitating the need for enhanced security measures. Also, the increased need for remote monitoring and banking solutions is further giving impetus to the growth of the market. The market has high opportunities in analytics, biometrics, and ethical hacking. Biometrics has largely been implemented in the industry, and its adoption is increasing at a fast pace owing to the extent of security and safety it leverages. The growth in the number of web data breaches and its increasing pace have changed the perception held by the BFSI industry. There is a growing shift towards the adoption of new software to protect the integrity of banks and customer data. The various software available are identity and access management, unified threat management, IDS/IPS, disaster recovery, security and vulnerability management, and encryption. The growth in BYOD, mobile apps, and cloud has resulted in the greatest adoption of IAM in the banking industry. The increased terror activities, robberies, identity stealing, and data breaches are amongst the major reasons driving the need for physical security in the banking industry. The various technologies leveraging the BFSI sector with physical security are access control, video surveillance, physical security information management, intrusion, and fire detection. The BFSI premises have already installed video surveillance, IAM, encryption, and fire detection systems; and many countries have mandated such installations owing to the need of security. The market for BFSI is competitive with major software vendors such as IBM, Cisco, Symantec already having a renowned position in market. Cisco is enhancing the customer's experiences through premium and convenience banking along with global security programs. IBM is focussing on security and generates around $2 billion of revenue from security alone annually. Symantec is focussing on DDos mitigation and increased information security management. Other global players such as Stromshield, dell, Gemalto NV, Accenture, and Trend Micro are also into providing increased solutions for BFSI security market.
