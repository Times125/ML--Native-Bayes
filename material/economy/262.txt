This includes education, housing, food and health. They also impact positively on savings, investments and job creation in communities. They represent an important safety net in times of crisis, providing critical resources which can help families cope with sudden shocks, for example a poor crop yield, or a natural disaster.The UK has a unique position to be able to help the current remittance framework.
