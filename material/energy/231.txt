The federal environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, will work with the operators of a controversial oil and gas port after  without an environmental impact assessment.However it is unlikely the project will undergo the long called-for assessment but rather an earlier departmental investigation would be re-examined. The $130m Port Melville facility on the  Islands off the coast of Darwin, includes a deep water port and 30m-litre tank farm for fuel storage and distribution. It is in an environmental area of  international significance , home to at least 38 threatened species.In May last year it was revealed construction of the facility   touted by operators as a hub for the oil and gas industry   had , largely through a loophole in Northern Territory legislation.The federal department of environment claimed the then minister, Greg Hunt, was unaware of it, despite advertisements in the media, and press releases by both the proponent and the NT government.  found the port could continue to operate without a full assessment, provided it complied with .On Friday afternoon , finding it was  because of questions over how the company would comply with some of the conditions set.The two parties   the federal environment minister and the Environment Centre NT (ECNT)   agreed it should be referred back to the minister, now .A spokeswoman for Frydenberg told Guardian Australia the department would work closely with the proponent on the new decision, as the original referral remained valid. Public consultation on the referral undertaken last year also remains valid,  she said.The decision does not require the full environmental impact assessment sought by environmental groups, and the spokeswoman said the department wouldn t  pre-empt the outcome of a future decision . The court has not made a decision on the validity of the department s decision but has accepted a request for the department to remake the decision,  the spokeswoman said. The department believes that this is the most efficient path to regulatory certainty under the [Environmental Protection and Biodiversity] Act in this case. The principal solicitor for the the Environmental Defenders Office NT, David Morris, told Guardian Australia his organisation and the ECNT believed  any decision other than a full environmental impact statement is entirely inappropriate for a developing of this scale and in this context .The department spokeswoman also did not comment on whether the delay to operator AusGroup s commercial operations would cost the NT or federal governments.The port commenced full operations in November 2015, but the fuel depot was reportedly awaiting the court decision. NT minister for the environment, Lauren Moss, welcomed the court s decision, and blamed the federal government and former NT Country Liberal government for creating uncertainty through a  failure to follow proper process . The proper consideration of environmental impacts of development proposals is crucial for effective decision making and sustainable development across the Territory into the future,  Moss said. The decision demonstrates the lack of transparency and accountability of environmental assessment processes that occurred during the term of the former CLP government. At the time the controversy came to light, then environment minister, Garry Higgins, who is now the leader of the opposition, revealed another legislative loophole meant After government documents revealed  port developments  were listed under the responsibilities of the chief minister, Adam Giles, the government the said the facility did not trigger the need for ministerial approval because .Hunt then , which found the port could operate under the set conditions. revealed the department had received multiple warnings about poor environmental impact considerations by the company, and inadequate plans in the event of a cyclone or oil spill.The , finding Port Melville  can be managed in a manner that avoids significant environmental impacts , but noted several concerns.It was the result of this investigation which the EDO, on behalf of the ECNT, challenged in the federal court.Morris said the court decision was a warning to people and companies seeking to  develop the north . Don t cut corners and don t think you can get away with more here than you can in other parts of Australia,  he said.
