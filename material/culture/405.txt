here s little to like in this undercooked  horror  about three siblings who stage a bank heist and run into trouble when they encounter a haunted vault. Heavy on gore (we see someone kill themselves with a power drill), but light on story,  lazily relies on  s sinister 70s porn  tache and permanently furrowed brow to signal the direction of the narrative in lieu of a properly structured script. For a film that s a restrained 90 minutes long, it s dour, it drags and is drunk on its own incoherent mythology. Without real stakes, the scares don t land   fine, if it s meant to be a fun romp, but I only detected one joke ( The only thing that spooks me is a bad loan,  says the bank manager).In terms of star power, Taryn Manning is the main attraction, trotting out the white trash act with which she s made her name (Pennsatucky in , and pregnant teen Mimi in the Britney Spears vehicle ), but she s gritting her teeth through the thankless role.
