 climbed to 1.2% in November, the highest level in more than two years, in a sign that the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote is fuelling a rise in the cost of living. The rise in the consumer prices index, from 0.9% in October, was largely driven by higher petrol and clothing prices according to the .November s rate was the highest since October 2014, and slightly above the 1.1% forecast by City economists. Frances O Grady, the TUC general secretary, said rising inflation posed a threat to living standards in the UK. Working people are facing over a decade of lost wage growth, with rising prices hitting their pay packets again. The government needs to act fast to avoid another living standards crisis. That means a clear plan for Brexit that will protect jobs, pay and rights. Economists said the rise in the headline inflation rate suggested a weaker pound was pushing up consumer prices by making imports more expensive.Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said:  There was a scattering of monthly increases for exchange rate sensitive components that were higher than the seasonal norm. This to me represents the early signs of the pound s depreciation feeding into the inflation data. There is plenty more where that came from. , to about 3%, putting increased pressure on household finances.Richard Lim, chief executive at the consultancy Retail , said shops faced a choice between passing rising costs on to consumers, taking a hit on margins, or passing them on elsewhere in the supply chain. Most retailers will use a combination of all three to distribute the impact of rising input costs but households will have to share some of the pain,  he said.  How much pain and how quickly it feeds through will be critical in determining the strength of spending next year. Higher inflation in 2017 is expected to coincide with a period of poor wage growth, rising unemployment and weaker economic growth all adding to the pressure on household finances. Higher prices for winter coats were largely behind a 1.6% increase in the cost of clothing between October and November. Petrol prices increased by 1.6p a litre between October and November this year, but fell by 1.5p a litre a year ago.Other items contributing to higher inflation in November were leather sofas, bleach, pizza, computers and printers. Some manufacturers of IT equipment said the weaker pound was pushing up prices because products were usually priced in dollars.  also showed the prices paid by manufacturers for materials and energy continued to rise at a brisk pace on a year ago. They were up 12.9% from November 2015, the biggest rise for five years. They appeared to pass some of that on to clients, with output prices up 2.3% in November on a year ago, the biggest rise since April 2012.The ONS said  and  to a lesser extent  into some components of the consumer prices index that tend to be imported, such as fuel. Statisticians also said the drop in the pound had amplified the effect on inflation from a rise in global oil prices.Mike Cherry, national chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, said higher costs were hitting companies.  Our members have so far managed to absorb the increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures but the effects are now beginning to bite. Many small businesses rely on road travel to transport goods, receive supplies and for their staff to get to work so the rising cost of petrol is a major concern. Responding to the inflation data, the Treasury said:  The economy remains fundamentally strong with taxes cut for millions of working people and the employment rate at a record high. The nt set out support for an economy that works for everyone, as we adjust to our new relationship with the EU.
