The LG K7i, launched by the South Korean firm at the India Mobile Congress this week, is embedded with technology that it says will keep mosquitoes away. It emits ultrasonic waves from a mesh grid on the back of the phone. The waves should repel the pests and are "absolutely safe and harmless for humans," the company said. Some other LG products such air conditioners and TVs are already available with the "mosquito-away" technology. There are also apps that claim to use similar technology with similar results, but LG says this is the first time it has been embedded in a smartphone. The K7i Android phone has a price tag of 7,990 rupees ($122). LG says it is considering plans to roll it out in other countries.
