As your article highlights (, 26 May), the demographic shift that we are currently facing may put financial strains on the economy unless changes to both employment and recruitment practices towards older workers are addressed. However, our increasing longevity needs to be seen as an opportunity, not a financial burden.The fact we are living longer means we can enjoy longer careers, and it is estimated that extending the average working life by just one year could increase GDP by 1%, or  20bn by 2023. Our research has shown that people derive benefits from working in later life, as long as that work is fulfilling.We need employers to actively retain, retrain and recruit older workers, and give them the same opportunities that younger employees enjoy when it comes to training, development and career progression.By 2020, one in three workers will be over 50 in the UK. If more of us are needing to work for longer, we will need to change our attitudes and ways of working. How we work and retire will be very different from our parents and grandparents. Employers need to consider more flexible ways of working to support older workers.
