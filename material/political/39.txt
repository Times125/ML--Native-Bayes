Here's former Ala. Chief Justice Roy Moore on his horse "Sassy," leaving his polling place in Gallant, Ala. after voting in #ALSenate. pic.twitter.com/acg1zswVNF Moore galloped into the rural polling center with several other riders, an activity he said he's done every year an election is held.? "I think it's a good thing to do, I won the last time I rode a horse, I think maybe have good favor," Moore said.? Moore told reporters that the ride is also a nice break from the car miles he accrued over the campaign. "You know after a long election getting out and dong something together, being on the road I've ridden thousands of miles in the car, figure I can ride a few miles on a horse." Speaking to reporters and posing for photos in his black Stetson hat, Moore said he "looked forward to registering our vote to make this country great again and make it good again." "I know there's a lot of motivation out there to change Washington and I appreciate the people understanding that it's not the money from Washington that's going to buy this election, it's the people of Alabama that are going to vote in this election," he added.? Moore is running in the GOP primary against Rep. Mo Brooks and Sen. Luther Strange, the state's former attorney general who was appointed to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions' vacant seat. If no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Tuesday, the top two finishers will face each other in a September run-off election.?
