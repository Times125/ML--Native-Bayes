ow let s turn the Royal Festival Hall into a rave!  In all my experience of concert-going at the Southbank Centre, this was a first. Most of the audience were already on their feet, but the prompt from ?lafur Arnalds   a composer and one half of Icelandic techno duo Kiasmos   had people streaming down the aisles towards the stage, hands aloft. For the next 90 minutes, Kiasmos set in motion shimmering, rib-quaking layers of electronic sound that flowed across each other and pulled apart, while CGI scenes of slow-motion apocalypse unfolded on a vast screen behind the mixing decks   imagine  with industrial-strength bass.Kiasmos represented one aesthetic extreme of this two-day event celebrating the 10th anniversary of , a London-based record label that describes itself as a  genre-defying  home for  avant-garde artists . At the other extreme was , a bearded mystic who ranted against modern-day materialism but offered to sell records following his afternoon show. Though he played a mixture of new and older work it was all in the same vein: the swirling, mostly-tonal arpeggio figuration of what he calls  continuous music , churned out with the piano s sustaining pedal down.Incomparably more sophisticated was the dapper 12-piece outfit Penguin Cafe. Surrounded by giant pot-plants and equipped with a plethora of instruments from a battery of ukuleles to a tabla (via a string quintet, two melodicas, bird whistles and a Steinway grand), they served up a mix of gently kitsch hits and new, minimalism-influenced material   all rhythmically taut and irrepressibly energetic. Similar energy levels, though a very different kind of sound, characterised the set played on Friday evening by Brooklyn drum-piano-and-bass trio Dawn of Midi, which wove a series of beguilingly complex sonic fabrics from musical materials as simple as repeated notes plucked on an acoustic bass.Nothing, though, could compete for simplicity with multi-instrumentalist Peter Broderick, who wandered onto the stage alone, singing the Irish ballad As I Roved Out on a May Morning. I don t know how audible he was at the back of the hall but from the stalls, before he was plugged in, before the heavier Indie-folk vocals, before the electronic looping, his spare, sinewy voice provided a moment of respite   and a reminder that if defying genre is the aim, the sound of the human voice is as radical as it gets.
