y now, most listeners will probably have a take on , originally out of Brooklyn via Cincinnati, now residing as far apart as LA and Copenhagen. Two pairs of multi-instrumentalist brothers and a lanky, lugubrious frontman, they deal in literate rock that presents at first as artily sombre, and eventually as one of the most nuanced 21st-century iterations of what used to be known as  college rock .Ten years on from their breakout album, , the National come packing more filigree   just listen to the jazzy sussurations and sneaky digitals on the title track   and more heft. Having survived a number of , they have, on this evidence, also happily bypassed the smugness that could come of success.Nothing on  is headline-new. But you are either in singer Matt Berninger s corner, clinging on as he drills down into his anxieties, or you are wondering why even validated white guys in first-world countries can still eat themselves up inside so insatiably.Then there s the tension created by the hyper-musical brother duos, pacing the cage of what  rock band  means with increased vigour. It often adds up to a subtle, grown-up take that still leaves space for drama   Turtleneck, for one, has the energising air of a Nick Cave song.Elsewhere, it makes for aural intrigue   as on I ll Still Destroy You, a restless, semi-digital ballad that contrasts what the Dessner and Devendorf brothers can do underneath Berninger s self-flagellating croon. Sometimes you wonder, however, whether a rougher and readier digital sketch like Walk It Back might have benefited from even more directness. The track ends with the re-voiced sample of a purported  ( We are history s actors ) which just dangles, not discernibly contextualised. Berninger has hinted that the  beast  of the album title might be the positive energy of future generations, but again the songs don t bear this out.If you were Berninger s in-laws,  might make for some awkward silences at Thanksgiving. Berninger might seem like ideal bohemian husband material   urbane, with few of the liabilities endemic to the role of lead singer   but he queries every relationship, every comfort.  I wasn t a catch/ I wasn t a keeper,  goes , a love song,  I was wandering around like the one who found dead John Cheever in the house of love.  Carin Besser is the real name of Berninger s partner, which prompts the usual head-scratching about writerly distance.Another desperately sad song, , only piles on the midlife romantic anomie. The cheery trumpet is certainly not helping, parping away in the background as a sinkhole opens up, swallowing certainty. Autobiography, or not? The plot only thickens when you learn that , just as Tom Waits s partner, Kathleen Brennan, does. Ultimately, though, these fudged irresolutions   political and romantic   tantalise more than they distract. As the National keep proving, little is ever straightforward.
