wo non-fiction books about death impressed the critics this month. Robert McCrum s  is  proof, yet again, that death makes for lively reading , wrote  in the Spectator;  witty, companionable and compulsively readable   [bringing] evidence that however bleak, however short the time left, it is never too late to be surprised by joy . The Sunday Times s  admitted that it  might sound pretty dismal, but McCrum s investigative spirit takes hold of the narrative and keeps pathos at bay   this is a brave book , and even (like McCrum, a stroke survivor), who  worried that [the book] might be unremittingly bleak , was  encouraged and fortified  in the Mail on Sunday. In the New Statesman, found it a  beautifully contemplative account of what it means to be dying, as we all are, in the midst of life   There is not a single story that he tells, no matter how grave, that is not made joyous by the fine attention of his writing and its judicious and intelligent use of quotation and literary and scientific material. Reviewers were equally moved by Maggie O Farrell s , a memoir of her 17 brushes with death   from childhood illness to an encounter with a murderer on a remote hilltop.  Each chapter is an accomplished piece of memoir-writing in its own right. The cumulative effect is extraordinary and I felt my understanding of what it means to be a human and a mother grew,  wrote  in the Times.  Where other writers may be playing with paper, O Farrell takes up a bow and arrow and aims at the human heart.  It was  ingenious and original   a rich celebration of every breath O Farrell s taken , according to  in the Independent and  extraordinary   uncomfortable and compelling   a page-turner   fluent, poised and packed with colourful details  according to  in the Observer. In the Irish Times,  hailed it as  electric   [it] should be read by everyone working with sick children   By stripping herself of the storytelling apparatus of her novels   or perhaps by applying that storytelling apparatus directly to her life   O Farrell has arrived at something more affecting: wise, terrifying, vital and important. s ninth collection, , did not disappoint. The Observer s  praised his  considerable facility for voice  while the Daily Mail s  enjoyed the characters   interior dialogues, recited in a brilliantly realised Scottish vernacular .  Some of them are bleak, but not all; there are some moments of joy,  wrote the Scotsman s .  Kelman has always been a true and honest writer, which is why he is one of the fairly few who really matter.  In the Irish Independent, the collection s darkness was a strength.  These little nuggets are more like philosophical essays about what it means to be alive. Or, seen from another angle, what it means to be on a slow road to death,  wrote .  Kelman s vision of the world is bleak   but redemption is forthcoming   Uncompromising in vision, and yet strangely adaptable in style and content, Kelman s harsh tales of dirty realism have sympathy for how suffering is a central component of the human condition. This collection shows a writer who is still at the top of his game, brimming with creativity, vitality and artistic integrity.
