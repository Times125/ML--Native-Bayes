escribed by one scholar as  the worst libretto Handel ever set, with scarcely a redeeming feature , we know little of  s early origins in London in 1713. But wow, what music! One hit after another, with unusual concentration because it s relatively short, with a short, lamenting duet and a wild aria for Metella (Sunhae Im) like a vocal Arrival of the Queen of Sheba.  s experienced cast   Sonia Prina, Vivica Genaux, Roberta Invernizzi   now has this idiom totally sorted, and with the glassy, dancing playing of Europa Galante the whole thing shoots along. Maybe it will never see the stage, but it suits the CD player.
