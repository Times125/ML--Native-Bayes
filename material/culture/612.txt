ne of the strengths of the cycle of  symphonies that  recorded with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic was his convincing performances of some of the lesser heard works, scores that are often dismissed as emptily rhetorical. One of those, the 12th Symphony, was the main work in Petrenko s visit to the Proms with the Oslo Philharmonic, whose chief conductor he has been now for four years.This was only the second performance of the 12th Symphony at the Proms; Malcolm Sargent conducted the London premiere there in 1963. It was Shostakovich s third attempt at composing a  Lenin symphony , a programmatic work celebrating the success of the 1917 Russian revolution; material for the first of them, shorn of its programmatic associations, had eventually become the Sixth Symphony, and despite its subtitle   The Year 1917   the 12th is not graphically programmatic either. The movements all have descriptive titles   the first is Revolutionary Petrograd, the finale The Dawn of Humanity   but otherwise it follows a conventional symphonic scheme.It s certainly not top-drawer Shostakovich, and by the time it reaches the end of its over-protracted finale, we ve heard more than enough of the motto theme. But the best of the symphony is well worth hearing; Petrenko ratcheted up the tension thrillingly in the first movement and allowed the wind soloists the space to make the most of their opportunities in the slow second, even if he couldn t do much to mitigate the repetitiousness of what comes later.The orchestra, which made its mark internationally when Mariss Jansons was its music director in the 1990s, remains a top-class ensemble. It had already had a chance to show what it could do in the 1919 suite from Stravinsky s Firebird ballet   a moment of raggedness in the Infernal Dance stood out only because it was such an outlier   even though Petrenko kept things on a tight rein, and then created just the right glitzy backdrop for  performance of  Fourth Piano Concerto. For all the polish in Andsnes s playing there was just a touch of brittleness about it all too, which wasn t inappropriate.
