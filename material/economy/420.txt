It has been a difficult decade for savers. For 10 years they have suffered falling or ultra-low interest rates, leaving them in the red on their deposit accounts when they might reasonably have expected a modest gain.The last time the Bank of England put up interest rates was on 5 July 2007. But the financial crash put paid to further rises. In the next 20 months it tumbled to 0.5% and then further in the wake of last year s Brexit vote to 0.25%.Ten years ago only ?23bn was saved in deposit accounts with no annual interest. The vast majority of savers were earning an average 3.3% on cash in instant access accounts and 5% on accounts where some notice must be given, according to research by the financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown. Today almost ?180bn of cash savings sits in non-interest-bearing accounts and the few people who shop around earn just 0.4% on money in instant access accounts and 0.9% on notice accounts. This collapse in interest rates and 26% inflation over the 10-year period has turned ?1,000 cash in a savings account in 2007 into ?878 in real terms, according to Hargreaves Lansdown.This compares with the gains made possible by ?1,000 invested in the stock market, which is now worth ?1,323 adjusted for inflation and with the 50% drop in share prices that followed the financial crash taken into account.An even better rate of return has gone to those who have borrowed money and have relatively little interest to pay. About 7m households have a mortgage and for them the average interest bill has declined from 5.8% to 2.6%.Laith Khalaf, the firm s senior analyst, said:  While cash savers have undoubtedly felt the pinch from lower interest rates, there have been benefits for borrowers which have helped support the economy. He said unsecured consumer borrowing rates have fallen too. The result was much lower levels of consumer loan defaults.  UK lenders have written off ?2.5bn of bad consumer loans over the last year. This compares to ?6.8bn in 2007,  he said.One consequence of cheap borrowing is that Britons are doing more of it than ever. In absolute terms, UK consumer debt stands at ?199bn, compared with ?191bn in July 2007. The good news is household income has also risen over this period, which along with low interest rates make this debt more affordable,  he said.However, the household debt to disposable income ratio, which peaked at 159.7% in 2008, has started to rise again, up from 139.9% in 2015 to 142.6% in 2016.
