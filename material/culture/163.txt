arlier this year, on a two-night stand at Ronnie Scott s, the 75-year-old guitar giant  (Jeff Beck, Pat Metheny and Chick Corea are among his famous fans, but he has also been a key pioneer of Asian-western fusions) spliced new material from his  album with reworkings of his classic 70s jazz-fusion themes . This heavy-hitting but almost as often thoughtful live set is the result. The 4th Dimension are pianist/drummer Gary Husband, bass guitarist ?tienne Mbapp  and east/west percussionist Ranjit Barot   McLaughlin s formidable regular partners for a decade. The Mahavishnu Orchestra s Meetings of the Spirits arrives as crashing power chords and galloping drum-work, but finally the theme s famously brooding hook unleashes flying double-time improv from both McLaughlin and Husband. The recent Gaza City is slow-burningly lyrical, Sanctuary a mood-sustaining tone poem full of violin-like guitar entreaties. It s a must for the gigs  attendees, but also for all post-70s fusion fans, wherever they came in.
