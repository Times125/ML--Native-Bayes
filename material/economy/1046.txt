Britain¡¯s strength in the digital economy means it is one of the countries best placed to take advantage of the shift away from capital-intensive industry, according to an international survey of more than 150 countries.A study looking at the nations that would thrive in coming decades was dominated by Scandinavian countries. However, the UK was ranked as the highest-placed member of the G8 leading industrial countries, in fifth position.Sweden led the league table dominated by European nations published by , a platform created by LetterOne, chaired by the former Russian oil magnate Mikhail Fridman.

But the Global Perspectives report said economic success in the future would depend less on whether countries were well endowed with natural resources and had invested in capital-intensive industries.

The UK¡¯s highest scores were for economic diversity (3rd) and its digital economy (4th).Fridman said: ¡°We believe the countries that are best placed to thrive and prosper in the coming decades will be those who have the socio-economic infrastructure that allows every person to realise his or her intellectual and creative potential.¡±
