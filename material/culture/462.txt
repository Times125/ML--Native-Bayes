I watched police vehicles  underground station to try to protect us from people intent on pursuing their interests with bombs. And I remembered that only days ago, at the massive arms bazaar in London s Docklands, that same police force had arrested around a hundred of those of us intent on nonviolently resisting the?lucrative business of supplying people intent on pursuing their interests?with?bombs (, 11 September). Funny old world. As well as the abundant supply of EU flags on show at the Last Night of the Proms (, 11 September), presumably it was also no coincidence that Nina Stemme sang of Poor Jenny who  in 27 languages couldn t say no . And, as if anyone had missed the point,? Farewell and adieu to you, fair Spanish ladies  was missing from Henry?Wood s Fantasia. I now know from the article on the fatberg (, 13 September) that 11 double-decker buses are the same weight as 19 African elephants. Please clarify re Indian elephants. So, engineers for Thames Water are using shovels and high-powered jets to remove the fatberg. Surely liposuction would work just as well? By far the best, nicest and healthiest non-alcoholic drink is water kefir (, G2, 11 September). It can easily be combined with all sorts of flavours, and contains more probiotics than the most expensive tablets. I have never heard of it being served anywhere, but you can easily and cheaply make it yourself: just go online and look it up.
