rom the opening minutes of Chef: Come Dine With Us, the audience members know that they are unlikely to get away with sitting quietly in their seats. A chef in a green apron is looking for a “beautiful lady” and he is determined to find her in the crowd.When the lucky (or unlucky, depending on how you view audience interaction at the theatre) young woman is found, she is sat on a chair in the centre of the stage in front of five currently unmanned cooking stations, at which point the chef proceeds to serenade her with a heavily accented rendition of Only You while fashioning a rose out of a napkin. This is only the first of many moments in which the audience will be called upon to play a role in this ludicrous and hilarious South Korean production from Persona Inc and Atobiz Ltd, showing at Brisbane’s Powerhouse arts centre as part of .Insofar as a plot exists, it is this: Green Chef (Taemin Jung) and his older, fatter, moustachioed rival Red Chef (Seongmin Oh) are in a culinary showdown. After taking orders for various cuisine from the audience – chicken noodle soup, pizza, bibimbap – the chefs compete with each other to concoct the tastiest and most impressive version of each dish. Red Chef and Green Chef are assisted in their ostentatious, absurd and increasingly dramatic efforts by the lace-clad Sexy Chef (Minyoung Lim), perpetually flatulent Rookie Chef (Jaehong Park) and Cutie Chef (Jooha Song), whose frilly dress and giant pink bows belie the murderous rage that she occasionally unleashes on the hapless object of her affections, the bicep-flexing Iron Chef (Seungkoo Baek). This cast of caricatures has a video-game quality about it, which is only amplified by the cartoonish and exaggerated manner in which everything on stage occurs. The assistant chefs have other talents too – mainly in the realm of singing and dancing, puppetry and slapstick. Audience involvement is required to stage everything from awkward first dates to a noodle-dough-pillow assault – a clear favourite with the large number of children in the audience for the Saturday night show I attended. One particularly memorable sequence involving glow-in-the-dark sock-puppet fish is a reminder of just how effective simple visual tricks can be when done with slick professionalism. The stagecraft on show here is not particularly complex – there are a lot of swift prop substitutions under tables and so on – but the smoothness of the delivery and the sharply timed slapstick takes the performance to another level.Two beatboxers, Rhythm Chef (Seongjun Park) and MC Chef (Daehan Wii), provide the vast majority of the sound effects for what is essentially one long musical food fight. They are both extremely talented – they are the glue that holds this top-notch ensemble performance together – and their encore solo is a satisfying indulgence for the pair. In spite of all the on-stage chaos, Chef: Come Dine With Us runs at a lean 75 minutes – which is just enough utterly meaningless, totally absurd and thoroughly entertaining fun for one evening.
