t s a time of year for waiting and listening. The are already here; they turned up mid-March, tumbling in off the Africa-Yorkshire flyway and filling the leafless beech tops with their chiming .Now I m waiting for the . The bird writer Edward Grey wrote of being  ears a-tiptoe for the first note of a blackcap  in early spring. But it s not time yet. The blackcaps () that bred and sang and chacked here last year won t be back from north Africa or the Med until the first weeks of April.There s plenty going on in the meantime. On the riverside footpath, I walk through a drifting snowfall of off-white chaff, and high overhead the winter s last siskins are picking over the aspen catkins. A bit later on I hear a noise like a shovel scraping snow from a concrete doorstep. It s a , perched low in a sycamore and doing its best to sing. On the river, our kingfishers are renewing their pair-bond, chasing one another through the shadows of the rosebay. From the deeps of the young woodland, I hear, or half hear, another song   muttered and scratchy, punctuated with crackpot whistles. I only hear it once. This isn t where  blackcaps usually hang out   they prefer the holly and hedgerow further upriver   but this, I think, is one. It must be a wintering blackcap, one of the continental contingent that comes over from Germany or Austria just as our summer birds are shipping out for the warm south. They spend the winter battening on our bird tables. But the bird s singing won t serve much purpose here; these  (monk warblers) wait until they re back home before they stake out territory and breed. It is easy to forget how much practice goes into bird song. Here, I think I ve eavesdropped on a run-through, a warm-up. Soon our breeding blackcaps will be back with us, and the real performance can begin again.
