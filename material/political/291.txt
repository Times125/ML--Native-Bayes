Ivanka Trump, first daughter and adviser to her father President Donald Trump, caught international attention Saturday when she sat in for the president during a meeting at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.  The eldest Trump daughter took over her father's seat during a working session on the "Partnership with Africa, Migration and Health." Some of the members at the table included world leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Chinese President Xi Jinping. "Face the Nation" moderator John Dickerson asked U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley about the first daughter's unusual role in the administration as this is not her first time sitting in on a high profile international discussion. "She's got her certain issues that she focuses on and when those things come up then that's where she is," the ambassador said. Haley told Dickerson that Ivanka Trump has been "very well accepted nationally and internationally" and has focused on issues important to her like women entrepreneurship, poverty and famine. "She sees herself as part of a public servant family and she doesn't want to waste this time by not putting forward some effort to try and help the world." Haley said. A White House official told CBS News that Ivanka was sitting in the back and only briefly joined the main table when the President had to step out. We'll have more of our interview with U.N.
