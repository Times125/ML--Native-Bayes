So, Kitchen Disco, the children s book by David Cameron s former speechwriter Clare Foges, with Al Murphy, was written  in a day during a holiday in Gambia after  a lovely daydream about fruit jumping out of the bowl and dancing in a nightclub  (, Review, 19 November). While I am glad that this engaging book has been given to thousands of reception-age children by BookTrust for their enjoyment, it is naive to claim that  every child has a kitchen, so it is an inclusive story . The austerity agenda of Foges  former employer continues to create poverty and homelessness on a scale meaning that thousands of children living in hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation do not have their own kitchens, or fruit, or holidays. That is a story worth telling.
