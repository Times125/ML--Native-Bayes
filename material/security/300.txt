WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday that former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been tapped to form a team of cyber security experts to help deter future hackings against the United States. "Giuliani will be sharing his expertise and insight as a trusted friend concerning private sector cyber security problems and emerging solutions developing in the private sector," Trump said in a statement. In an interview Thursday, Giuliani said he would be "coordinating" meetings for cyber security experts in the private sector to share their knowledge. "First of all, it will give the government all the information available in the private sector, number two, it will form more connection between these people who are doing cyber security so they can work with each other," he said. It is yet unclear if Trump has handed Giuliani specific assignments or if Giuliani will contribute to the anti-cyber attack report Trump has promised to produce within 90 days of taking office. Giuliani has been an early supporter and an important figure in Trump's campaign team.
