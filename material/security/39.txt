Australia's three-pronged cyber security strategy 28 June 2017 Written by  Stephen Withers Published in Government Tech Policy Twitter Special adviser to the Prime Minister on cybersecurity Alastair MacGibbon has outlined the country's high-level cyber security strategy. At CSIRO's D61Live event   organised to coincide with Data61's first birthday   MacGibbon outlined the three aspects of the national cyber security strategy. It starts with "more defenders on the wall," especially at the Australian Cyber Security Centre, but also within the Defence Department, the Australian Federal Police and other agencies. The aim is not merely to protect the government sector, but the broader economy. Australia is also working towards global, rules-based governance of the Internet, as seen by the appointment of an ambassador for cyber affairs. Then there is increasing co-operation between government and industry, epitomised by the establishment of the Joint Cyber Security Centre in Brisbane, with similar centres planned for Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide. "The (cyber security) conversation has changed in this country" and is now deeper and more mature, MacGibbon said. But Australia has not yet done enough in this regard, he said, calling for the development of a robust sovereign cyber security capability, as is being promoted by the Australian Cyber Security Growth Network. Better education   starting in primary schools   is also required, he added.
