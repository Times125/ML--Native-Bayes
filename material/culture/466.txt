I m loving this duo from Toronto. R&B with a 4/4 flow. This is what the future of soul should sound like. Sexy stuff!I love this old Latin house record. Most people know it and those that don t think they do.This reminds me of D Angelo in 2017 mode. A very smooth record that tickles my taste for deep soul music.I love this band, but when they reworked  they went down as gods in my opinion. A cover should always be a different take on the original and this is just that. Beautiful.Cheesy? Maybe, but it sure got me down those stairs for the UPS man this morning.I once dropped this weapon at an afterparty, not sure everyone was quite on my vibe!   And the whole wedding erupts with joy.Probably my all-time fave record of theirs.The perfect combination of underground electronic music with a vocal from heaven.Reminds me of watching Trainspotting for the first time. Records like this define what electronic music is.
