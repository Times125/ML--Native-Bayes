n what must be a micro evolution for female action heroes, Kim Ok-bin s deadly assassin in The Villainess hacks her way through South Korea s criminal underworld while remaining fully-clothed and wearing a low heel appropriate for bringing down a wardrobe-sized goon.Like the protagonist of Luc Besson s , Sook-hee (Ok-bin) is a street-tough young killer recruited by a government agency with an offer she can t refuse: death or gainful employment as an assassin. After a spell at a finishing school for contract killers, she s issued with a false identity and released as a sleeper cell. With a body count in triple digits before the opening credits finish, the bloodily inventive fight sequences work better than the emotional scenes here   and sensible shoes aside, director Jung Byung-gil doesn t bring much new to the genre.
