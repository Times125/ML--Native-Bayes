She had at least half a dozen failings: Proposed withdrawal of HMS Endurance from the South Atlantic, precipitating invasion of the Falkland Islands; squandering North Sea oil and gas revenues; premature closure of coal pits; refusing EEC matching funding for regional aid; refusing to renew social housing; imposition of the poll tax first on Scotland, undermining the union  One major omission from David Beake s list of outstanding Oxford graduates: G Osborne, MA Oxon (austerity calamity)!

As a displaced follower of The Fife, I?would like to think that a more probable tongue-twisting outcome would be East Fife 5: Forfar 4 (, 7?September). Roll on 27 September when all will be revealed. It s no good printing Wednesday s racing tips in Thursday s paper (, 8 September). What we faithful subscribers wanted was Thursday s results in Wednesday s paper.  Regarding the sad news about Walter?Becker (, 5 September), as a lifelong Steely Dan fanatic I must insist that their album Countdown To Ecstasy is the greatest rock album ever?made.
