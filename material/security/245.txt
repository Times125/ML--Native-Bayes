SOFIA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev said here on Thursday after a meeting of the Consultative Council on National Security (CCNS) that his country needed to improve cyber security amid intense attacks. "Recently, Bulgaria has been a subject of intense cyber attacks against information infrastructures of the country, including against critical infrastructure and government institutions," said Plevneliev after the meeting which was dedicated to the national cyber security policy. Plevneliev who is the head of the CCNS, said Bulgaria lags behind other European Union (EU) countries and NATO members in the field of cyber security, and is unable to fulfill its commitments to the collective security. The council's position was that the government should provide funding to certain state institutions to increase the number of cyber security experts and acquire technological capabilities for preventing and counteracting current cyber threats. Meanwhile, the creation of a cyber defense operational center for the Ministry of Defense had to be accelerated, and cooperation with cyber security institutions in the EU and NATO should be strengthened, Plevneliev said. Last October and November, websites of Bulgarian institutions such as the Ministry of Interior, the State Agency for National Security, the parliament, the president, and the Central Election Commission experienced difficulties as a result of a distributed denial-of-service attack.
