Poland s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, whom green activists have criticised for allowing large-scale logging in the ancient Bia?owie?a forest, has called for the woodland to be stripped of Unesco s natural heritage status, banning human intervention.Bia?owie?a, straddling Poland s eastern border with Belarus, includes one of the largest surviving parts of the primeval forest that covered the European plain 10,000 years ago. It also boasts unique plant and animal life, including the continent s largest mammal, the European bison. The Bia?owie?a forest was granted  natural heritage status illegally and without consulting the local community,  Szyszko said in a statement, after having announced that  a complaint had been lodged with the prosecutor s office  regarding the matter.Szyszko said he found it contradictory for the forest to have Unesco natural heritage status   which bans any human intervention   and simultaneously belong to the EU s  of protected areas, which according to Szyszko allows the current logging.The Polish government has said it authorised the logging, which began in May last year, to contain damage caused by a spruce bark beetle infestation and to fight the risk of forest fires. But scientists, ecologists and the EU have protested and activists allege the logging is a cover for commercial cutting of protected old-growth forests.Szyszko would like to see Bia?owie?a granted a different Unesco status   mixed natural-cultural heritage    and not just natural because man s activity is visible to the naked eye in this forest , he said.Greenpeace, whose activists chained themselves to woodcutting equipment this month to block the logging, immediately denounced Szyszko s statement as  further manipulation . The environmental group also said logging was in fact out of line with the Natura 2000 rules. This is an attempt by the minister to impose his own narrative,  said activist Katarzyna Ko?ciesza of the ClientEarth environmental group.Szyszko s statement comes two weeks before the annual Unesco world heritage session, which this year will take place in the southern Polish city of Krak w. The forest gained the coveted  natural heritage  label in 2011.Unesco has previously expressed concern over the logging, as has the European commission, which in April warned Warsaw that it could take legal action to halt the logging.
