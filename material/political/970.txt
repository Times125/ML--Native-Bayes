The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday advanced the nomination of Christopher Wray to serve as FBI director. Lawmakers on the panel voted unanimously 20-0 to advance his nomination. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, intends to hold a floor vote to confirm Wray sometime before the Senate departs Washington for its August recess. Testifying at his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Wray said he said he's "sure as heck" he wouldn't give a loyalty pledge as President Trump had allegedly requested from former FBI director James Comey. "My loyalty is to the Constitution and the rule of law. Those have been my guideposts throughout my career, and I will continue to adhere to them no matter the test," Wray said. Mr. Trump fired Comey as his FBI director in early May.
