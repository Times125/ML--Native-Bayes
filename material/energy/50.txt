The National Farmers’ Federation has welcomed South Australia’s plan to provide royalties to landholders in return for gas development but warned farmers would want to ensure land and water was not compromised.The NFF chief executive, Tony Mahar, called on the federal government to expand independent bioregional scientific assessments to provide transparent evidence to prove water would not be adversely effected. The assessment process should work hand in hand with any royalty stream, he said.“It is not all about the money,” Mahar told Guardian Australia. “It’s a welcome addition to the discussion but this is not all about money.“It is about security and access to land and water for agriculture and that means not compromising the availability of land and water.”As part of the South Australian government’s energy plan, the premier, , committed to pay farmers a 10% royalty stream to allow access by mining companies for exploration and development of gas reserves.Along with battery storage, the royalty scheme was the only aspect of the SA plan praised by the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, who said the federal government had been considering the idea for some time.“Incentivising landholders to get more of the pie when they develop the gas reserves on their land, that’s a good thing,” Frydenberg said. Barnaby Joyce, the deputy prime minister and agriculture minister, also supports the idea. Last month Joyce said if miners cut a good deal with farmers providing revenue for access, it would be a “happy medium”.“If you cut a good deal with the farmers, then I think – as long as you’re not destroying aquifers and you’re not destroying prime-ag land – then I think you can find a happy medium in this debate,” Joyce said.“Because everybody wants to make a buck. Talk to them where they listen most and that’s through their wallet.”But Mahar said the showed agriculture was a $64bn injection to the Australian economy and the industry was eager to grow to $100bn.He said while the royalty stream was a good recognition of the concerns of farmers and regional community around mining developments, governments needed to provide confidence that their key assets – land and water – would not be compromised.To this end, the NFF would support the expansion of bioregional assessments that were designed to provide scientific analysis of the potential impacts of coal seam gas and coalmining development on water resources including wetlands and groundwater bores.The bioregional assessments were introduced by the Gillard government , Tony Windsor, Rob Oakeshott and Andrew Wilkie, in return for their support for the mining tax. “An expansion of the bioregional assessment program would provide transparent evidence to make decisions based on the science,” Mahar said.His comments come as the prime minister meets with gas chief executives to force companies to increase their domestic supply. While the Coalition does not favour an enforced domestic gas reservation, Malcolm Turnbull warned that gas companies  to operate if they fail to supply Australian domestic industry.Lock the Gate’s national coordinator, Phil Laird, said if the prime minister was listening to regional communities he would not suggest gas companies had a social licence to operate. “Saying gas companies have a social licence to operate is deluded and an insult to the farming communities who have been bullied and taken advantage of by unconventional gas,” Laird said. “Nothing could be further from the truth. Only last year a report from a South Australian parliamentary committee into unconventional gas said there was no social licence in the south-east. “The prime minister’s gas push is threatening our national food security and it’s being left to farmers and traditional owners to once again protect our land and water from shortsighted politicians.”
