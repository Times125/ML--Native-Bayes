They¡¯re not worried about job security but they are worried about prices.Over the first nine weeks of the year, sales growth at Domino¡¯s stores open for more than a year dropped to 1.5%, down from 10.5% in the same period a year earlier.Wild added that consumer ¡°have seen things like petrol rise in price, they¡¯re reading in the newspaper that food and energy prices are going up, and they¡¯re factoring that into spending.¡±He said that Domino¡¯s could gain from that because it ¡°sits neatly in the middle¡± and could gain from customers opting for a takeaway rather than eating out. ¡°This is a more value-conscious environment,¡± he added.Family finances are expected to come under increasing pressure in 2017 from  and .Investors lost their appetite foron Thursday, with shares plunging 16%.
