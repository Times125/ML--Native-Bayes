WASHINGTON -- More than $1 million has been raised for charity through the Congressional Baseball Game, its host organization announced Thursday, a day after a shooting unfolded at the Republicans' practice for the game. The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity confirmed the milestone on Facebook. It also said that the Nationals, the major league team that plays at the park, has released additional seating for Thursday night's game. "We have exceeded 20,000 in ticket sales," the post said. Due to the outpouring of support and generosity of our existing and new sponsors, over $1 million has been raised for... Twenty-six Democratic members of Congress and 33 of their Republican colleagues are signed up to play in Thursday's game -- a tradition that's been around since 1909. The political parties play against each another. The proceeds from the $10 tickets will be donated to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington, Washington Literacy Center and National Dreams Foundation. The shooting wounded House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, two Capitol Police officers -- Crystal Griner and David Bailey -- Matt Mika, who is a Tyson Foods lobbyist, and Zachary Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas. Scalise underwent a third surgery Thursday and was still in critical condition in the morning at a local Washington, D.C., hospital.
