lans for a new fleet of UK nuclear power plants are under way. Last month, for example, Hitachi and the Japanese government . But what about the ? And what happens when, in thousands of years, our descendants   who may not read any current human language   find a store, and put themselves in danger?A panel of when the US Department of Energy commissioned them to find a method of ensuring that whatever is left of humanity in 10,000 years  time is warned off the sites we ve been filling with radioactive sludge.The panel reasoned that since few people can read texts that are only 1,000 years old, written warnings guaranteed to be understood by future humanity could be difficult to create.The answer may lie in  nuclear semiotics    future-proof signs. Other options include hostile architecture, obelisks   or cats.In 1984, writer  suggested the answer could lie in breeding animals that   to radiation.  [Their] role as a detector of radiation should be anchored in cultural tradition by introducing a suitable name (eg,  ray cat ). In short:  when near radioactive material. A legend, passed on through the millennia, would trigger a response in humans to get out as soon as possible.The idea has recently gained fresh traction: the  movement, formed in 2015, is working to  insert ray cats into the cultural vocabulary . They say it may be possible to harness some animals  innate capacity to become fluorescent, or to absorb and emit light   but cats don t have the physiology to do that. Another way would be to engineer cats to glow using enzyme interaction   a mechanism used to study cellular activity. Far fetched, but it could just work.
