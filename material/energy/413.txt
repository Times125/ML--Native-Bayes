Pressure is growing on the South Australian government to scrap  after a citizens  jury rejected the concept.After investigating the issue over six sitting days, the jury of 350 South Australian residents refused to back the proposal, with 70% unwilling to support it under any circumstances.Premier  says his cabinet will take the verdict of the jury on board, but will also consider the views of more than 50,000 people who have provided feedback to the government so far. They ve said no but there are also 50 pages of why they ve said no and we need to understand that,  Weatherill said after receiving the jury s report on Sunday.But it delivers the idea of the dump, recommended for consideration by the state s royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle, a significant blow.Conservation groups have already rejected the idea along with Indigenous communities and it now appears the government will have trouble convincing the wider community.The majority report from the citizens  jury raised questions over safety and cost and also highlighted a lack of trust in the government to deliver, run and adequately regulate such a facility.But a minority report called for further economic modelling to be conducted before a final decision was made.It also raised concerns over bias on the jury, questioning whether opponents to the idea of a dump were over represented.The SA government has pledged to make a decision by the end of year but has always conceded that to go ahead the dump would need bipartisan support in state parliament and broad community consent.It would also require a change to Labor party policy, at both the state and federal level.Friends of the Earth campaigner Jim Green said the citizens  jury had delivered a clear message to Mr Weatherill. South Australians do not want the state turned into the world s nuclear waste dump,  he said.
