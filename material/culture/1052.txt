ytting follows up , his bestselling study of chopping logs the Scandinavian way, with a mystery novel that fits together like a piece of fine marquetry. Edvard Hirifjell is a young mountain farmer haunted by a smorgasbord of family secrets: the strange death of his parents when he was a child, a missing inheritance and an unexplained feud between his grandfather and great-uncle that dates back to the second world war. In search of answers he leaves Norway for the Shetland Islands, once Norwegian territory, where the trawlers still have Nordic names but the landscape is eerily free of trees. Sharp observations   the pleasant rattle of a matchbox; a beach  scrubbed clean  by a storm   underpin a study of roots and relics. As Edvard observes:  A man dies. He leaves behind tools and books and clothes. But he also leaves clues.  Truth emerges like new growth. The Sixteen Trees of the Somme by Lars Mytting is published by MacLehose Press ( 16.99).
