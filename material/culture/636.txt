ollywood s haphazard summer season persists with this sequel to the 2011 knockabout ice-hockey comedy, a film surely no more than 10 people felt required a follow-up. Writer-turned-director  has a funny-strange way of compiling it: he pads his vaguely depressive central thrust   Seann William Scott s dim-bulb brawler Doug Glatt realising he s now too old to throw down   with reels of boysy inside-hockey business that yield more shrugs than laughs. Enough useful players are on the roster to generate sporadic mild chuckles   MVP Wyatt Russell, as Glatt s thunderous bad-boy rival, inadvertently nails a major issue ( The world isn t watching   just Canada, and maybe three or four states )   but nobody lands the one knockout punchline to elevate matters above tolerable mediocrity.
