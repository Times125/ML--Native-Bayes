I have had the dubious pleasure of living in a hostel on Whitechapel Road for more than 18 months, and I could have told you (or, more pertinently, Thames Water) that there was something very wrong with the sewer over two years ago (, 13 September). In response to the seven bishops (, 14 September), can we expect to hear from Tory MPs and local councillors whose Christian faith makes it impossible for them to vote for cuts in local welfare assistance schemes? Perhaps a vicar s daughter somewhere might take the lead. Ian Watson s playful comments about the recent Steely Dan correspondence (, 14 September) are somewhat disingenuous. When I shared a flat with Ian in the 70s, he rarely had Steely Dan off the record player and was affectionately known to his flatmates as Kid Charlemagne. Your headline reads  Bilingual TV crime drama launches Welsh  noir  (, 11 September). Where have you been living? Hinterland?
