Richard Layard is promoting the idea that better provision of mental health services is more important than reducing social inequalities in promoting human happiness (, theguardian.com, 12 December). This is a false dichotomy. Evidence suggests that austerity damages our collective health. Deepening economic and social divides, bullying, abuse, misogyny, racism, dehumanisation and consequent insecurity, trauma, social exclusion, neglect and despair underpin the current tsunami of desolation in the UK and beyond, especially in our children. These are largely economic and political matters, requiring cultural, social and political solutions. Psychological therapies, humanely delivered to those who want them, have a part to play in ameliorating human suffering, and we do need more flexible, kind and supportive services. But we must not pathologise those who are damaged by the injustices they experience. Degradation by the benefits system is now devastating many with long-term illnesses in the UK. To imagine that therapy, rather than social transformation, can address or prevent the conditions that lead to despair is to be wilfully blind.                 Workplace happiness is not about the trivial (, 12 December). Micromanagement, being told what to do and blame cultures are the kind of things that make people unhappy at work. Instead, enable people to do work they are good at, give them the trust and freedom to do it well, have managers who coach rather than tell, and create a no-blame environment. The result will be happier staff and more productive organisations.
