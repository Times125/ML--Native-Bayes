The former mayor of London¡¯s response to  was trademark Boris Johnson bluster. To allege there was a cover-up was , he said. Of course he hadn¡¯t hid the impact of dirty air.But in defending his record on air pollution, he also seemed to make things worse. On Monday we didn¡¯t know if Johnson himself was personally aware of the findings of the unpublished report that the new mayor Sadiq Khan accuses him of suppressing. There was no denial from Johnson that the report (which was completed in September 2013) had not been published but perhaps it had never been brought to his attention. It is hard to actively suppress a report if you don¡¯t even know about it.Now we know he did know about it - or at least some of its key findings.On Tuesday, Johnson said there could be no cover-up because he had already made a speech in 2015 about pollution in deprived schools. ¡°I made the very point about primary schools and poor air quality in areas of deprivation. So as cover-ups go it wasn¡¯t a particularly brilliant one, considering I made a speech about it,¡± he told reporters during a visit to an aluminium plant.In that speech, a lecture to a small crowd at the Sir Simon Milton lecture in June last year, the then-mayor said: ¡°I can tell you that for London primary schools that have the misfortune to be in areas of poor air quality, 82%, 82% of those  primary schools affected by poor air quality are in areas of economic deprivation.¡±Set aside the fact that the actual figure is 83% or the fact that it was the schools that were considered deprived rather than the areas. What¡¯s interesting about this is it tells us Johnson had read the report, or had at least been briefed on its conclusions - and was talking about it nearly two years after it was handed over to City Hall by the authors.But neither he, his office or the former deputy mayor for environment and energy, Matthew Pencharz, can explain why it wasn¡¯t published. Johnson thought its key finding was striking enough to mention in a speech, and yet the full report was not made public.Pencharz  in response to people outraged at the apparent cover-up that if they listened to Johnson¡¯s response on Tuesday, they¡¯d know ¡°we were aware of [the] problem & [there was] no cover-up.¡± But there was no explanation of why the report was not published.There¡¯s also the question of the delay. If Johnson was so passionate about reducing the brutal inequality of air pollution why did he wait until June 2015 to mention the key finding in a report produced in September 2013?Even the author of the report, the director of the Oxford-based environmental consultancy Aether, says that the GLA under Johnson publicly disclosed some of the report¡¯s positive conclusions, but held back the negative ones. ¡°The crux of the report was about understanding the inequalities of air pollution, so they chose not to make public the findings regarding inequality,¡± Katie King told the Guardian. ¡°The information that they did take from the report was the positive, that exposure was predicted to fall in the future.¡± (You can now read the full document, titled ).For now, it¡¯s impossible to say whether Johnson personally intervened to prevent the report¡¯s publication. But what is clear is that the report¡¯s findings - that of the 433 primary schools in the capital affected by illegal pollution, 83% were deprived schools - were as politically toxic as the air in question.
