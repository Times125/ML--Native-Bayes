avid Harrower s  (1995) is a tense, violent, unrelenting piece. One white feather after another falls on to a dark stage   a chicken is being plucked. Set in medieval times, the play explores the marriage between a young woman (superb and courageous Judith Roddy) and her ploughman husband, Pony William (compelling Christian Cooke). Life is feral   between a rock and a hard place. A handful of carrots, an old sheet, the aforementioned chicken. What is there to do other than toil, copulate, quarrel and eat? But life changes after the young woman hears laughter ringing from the stables where her husband keeps his horses.Harrower is interested in the way that words transform experience   as does a written record (the pen is a means here to rising above your lot). The young woman s language is inchoate, she is engaged in a wordsearch abetted by a lonely miller (a powerfully still Matt Ryan). Ya?l Farber directs surely, and the fluent physicality of the evening is striking (movement director: Imogen Knight). Designer Soutra Gilmour honours the play s darker purpose with a mighty millstone, and occasional flurries of white flour punctuate this nightmarish Miller s Tale.
