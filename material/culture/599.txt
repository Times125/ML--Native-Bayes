n this inane sequel to Michael Dowse s 2011 Canadian sports comedy , Seann William Scott returns as Doug Glatt. An ice hockey hero, captain of the Halifax Highlanders and  a huge, Jewish freight train , Glatt is good natured and more than a little slow. When he gets his face pounded in on the ice by blond-haired baddie Anders Cain (Wyatt Russell), he hangs up his skates and takes early retirement. He tries his luck with a new job in the basement office of an insurance company ( Doug Glatt   storage room. That s you! ), while pregnant wife, Eva (Alison Pill, doing her best but not showing her range), tries to keep his spirits up, but it s not long before he s sneaking back to the rink.Directed and co-written by Jay Baruchel (one of the stars of the little-seen American TV drama  and the voice of  s Hiccup),  s puerile jokes won t be to everyone s tastes, though fans of North American gross-out comedies (and of jocks punching one another) may have fun spotting the scene s stalwarts as supporting characters, among them Elisha Cuthbert and Liev Schreiber.Baruchel, too, has written himself a small but shouty role as Pat, an irritating, foul-mouthed nerd who wears a string vest and a baseball cap that says  Fuck white people  (he s better behind the camera than he is in front of it, which isn t saying much).
