nce a fading 1970s synthpop star, Gary Numan s career has been gradually revitalised since Sugababes  2002 smash  mashed up his  and Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson  of electronic industrial gloom. There s plenty of the latter on his 21st studio album. Guitars and keyboards crash like falling slabs of granite, percussion pulses throb and synths purr ominously. Numan s dystopian worldview hasn t been exactly cheered by climate change or leaving Britain for Los Angeles, only to find a Trumpocalypse.  We live in a windswept hell, not even God remembers , he sings, bleakly. However, tunefulness permeates the intensity like rays of sunshine. Huge, Cars-type banks of synthesisers fire Bed of Thorns and The End of Things and the east Asian-tinged  (featuring 11-year-old daughter Persia) is one of his catchiest songs in years. For all the retooling, the vintage Numanoid still has a pop star s beating heart.
