"Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday said that President Trump's comments surrounding Charlottesville was detrimental to the country. ""Mr. President, I encourage you to try to bring us together as a nation after this horrific event in Charlottesville. Your words are dividing Americans, not healing them,"" the South Carolina Republican said in a statement. Graham said that Mr. Trump ""took a step backward"" on Tuesday ""by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally"" and people like Heather Heyer, who was killed in the terror attack on Saturday. ""I, along with many others, do not endorse this moral equivalency,"" he said. ""Many Republicans do not agree with and will fight back against the idea that the Party of Lincoln has a welcome mat out for the David Dukes of the world."" CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid was on the ground during the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and joins CBSN to fact-check President Trum... During a press conference at Trump Tower Tuesday, the president again blamed both sides -- the white supremacists and the people protesting them -- for the Charlottesville violence. ""What about the alt-left that came charging them? Excuse me. What about the alt-left that came charging at the — as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?"" Mr. Trump said. ""You have some very bad people in that group,"" he continued. ""But you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. You had people in that group — excuse me, excuse me — I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name."""
"President Trump's embattled chief strategist Steve Bannon lashed out at his rivals in the administration in a rare interview with the American Prospect, which was published Wednesday.  Bannon told progressive American Prospect writer Robert Kuttner about his plan to neutralize his opponents, which include top officials and advisers to President Trump. ""They're wetting themselves,"" he said of his adversaries in the administration who disagree with him on trade and economic policies. Bannon proceeded to relay how he wants to create an outside group of trade hawks with factions from both the left and the right wings of the political spectrum. Bannon told Kuttner he's ""changing out people at East Asian Defense,"" and getting Susan Thornton, the acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs for the State Department, ""out at State."" ""That's a fight I fight every day here,"" he said. ""We're still fighting. There's Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying."" ""We gotta do this,"" Bannon continued about taking an aggressive stance against China on trade issues. ""The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day."" ""To me, the economic war with China is everything,"" Bannon told Kuttner. ""And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover."" Bannon's call to Kuttner, who says he'd never spoken to the former Breitbart publisher before, came as Bannon's future in the White House is uncertain. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said ""we'll see"" what happens with Bannon, in the middle of a chaotic press that blamed ""both sides"" for violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. ""Well we'll see -- look, like, I like Mr. Bannon, he's a friend of mine, but Mr. Bannon came on very late, you know that,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that, and I like him, he is a good man, he is not a racist, I can tell you that. He's a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard, but we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon, but he's a good person, and I think the press treats him frankly very unfairly."" Sources claim that Steve Bannon's White House job is in jeopardy. Josh Gerstein, senior White House reporter for Politico, joins CBSN to discuss ... Bannon, who in the past has bragged about his connections to the ""alt-right,"" dismissed the far-right protesters as an irrelevant ""fringe element."" ""Ethno-nationalism—it's losers,"" Bannon said. ""It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more."" ""These guys are a collection of clowns,"" the president's chief strategist added.  Bannon also said pursuing a military option with North Korea in the face of its nuclear threats is useless.  ""There's no military solution, forget it,"" Bannon said. ""Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul [South Korea] don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us."" "
"ATLANTA -- With the president under fire for remarks about Charlottesville, CBS News checked in with some Republicans who voted for him. Janelle Jones, Ellen Diehl and Lucretia Hughes say their support for President Trump has not lessened. ""I don't look at him as my pastor or my moral leader,"" said Jones. ""I look at him as the leader as it relates to governmental issues."" ""We are not looking for somebody charming,"" Diehl said. ""We are looking for a man who knows how to turn things around and he's got a track record of turning things around."" Janelle Jones, Ellen Diehl and Lucretia Hughes all voted for President Trump. When she saw the violence in Charlottesville, Diehl said, for her, ""it wasn't necessarily a complete black-white issue. But I think the media is turning it into a black-white issue. It's definitely a left-right issue. But its left fringe and right fringe."" As for the Confederate monuments, Hughes said they are ""history."" ""I wasn't born back then you wasn't either,"" Hughes said. ""So why is that affecting us? If anything we should grow and learn from it.  Just like Martin Luther King said, you don't judge people by the color of their skin. You base that on their character."" CBS News chief Washington correspondent and ""Face the Nation"" moderator John Dickerson joins ""CBS This Morning"" from Washington to discuss Presid... As for the criticisms Mr. Trump has faced about his reaction to racial tension, Hughes and Jones said that does not change their support. ""I think for myself. Period,"" Hughes said. ""Nobody is going to tell me what to think or how to think. I am not gullible and I am not blind. It's my decision if I am going to support someone or not. Not go by what other people has to say and to me what I have seen and what I love, he is not going to lose my support any time soon."" ""I have been a Republican before Donald Trump, I will be a Republican afterwards,"" Jones said. ""I honestly don't think we will see this issue a racial divide addressed until we remove identity politics out of the political process."" These Republican women say if a president deserves blame for making racial tensions worse it's former President Obama, not Mr. Trump, and the identity politics they believe Democrats have practiced for the last eight years."
"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- As night fell in Birmingham Tuesday, city workers raised a blackened plywood wall around the Confederate memorial that has stood there for more than a century. By Wednesday morning, Roy Brook, carrying an American flag, marched alone in protest. ""I just hate seeing history destroyed,"" Brook said. Roy Brook protests the covering of a Confederate monument in Birmingham, Alabama. The violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, re-ignited the debate, and Birmingham Mayor William Bell says these monuments don't belong in what he calls the cradle of the civil rights movement. Birmingham Mayor William Bell ""I want it gone,"" Bell said. ""Think about what it represents. The Confederacy was an act of sedition. It was an act of treason."" The Southern Poverty Law Center found some 1,500 Confederate memorials across the country, including 718 statues and monuments and 10 U.S. military bases named after Confederate officers. But the list has gotten a little smaller: Baltimore's mayor ordered that city's four Confederate monuments removed. And protesters in Durham, North Carolina, took matters into their own hands -- and feet -- to remove a statue at the county courthouse. A statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in the U.S. Capitol. And even on Capitol Hill -- where ten statues including those of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and Gen. Robert E. Lee stand in Statuary Hall -- critics want them gone, too. ""It sends the message we have not learned from our past. We have not learned that all God's children are created equal,"" Bell said. The Alabama attorney general is suing the city of Birmingham and the mayor, saying the wall obstructs the view to the monument which violates a state law signed this year."
"The Trump administration will make Obamacare payments to insurers for August, a White House spokesman said Wednesday. The president has repeatedly said he might end the payments, known as cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments, which are currently slated to cost the government $7 billion during this fiscal year and $10 billion in 2018. These payments are made to health insurers to help low-income people enrolled under the health care law with out-of-pocket expenses. This comes a day after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that cutting off the payments would result in premiums going up 20 percent next year and the federal deficit growing by $194 billion over a decade. In a statement Wednesday, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, said that the president's decision helps ""18 million Americans who buy health insurance on the individual market."" ""State insurance commissioners have warned that abrupt cancellation of cost-sharing subsidies would cause premiums, copays and deductibles to increase and more insurance companies to leave the markets in 2018,"" said Alexander, who is calling for a more permanent bipartisan solution. ""Congress now should pass balanced, bipartisan, limited legislation in September that will fund cost-sharing payments for 2018 as well as make section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act work better to give states more flexibility in approving insurance policies.  These two actions will help make insurance policies available at affordable prices,"" he added. His committee is scheduled to hold bipartisan hearings on stabilizing the health insurance market the week of Sept. 4. "
"BATON ROUGE, La. -- A neo-Nazi website's publisher said Wednesday that he has ""effectively been completely banned from the internet"" after mocking the victim of a deadly car attack at a white nationalist rally in Virginia. ""Clearly, the powers that be believe that they have the ability to simply kick me off the internet,"" Andrew Anglin, who has published the site from an undisclosed location, complained to The Associated Press in an e-mail. Access to The Daily Stormer had been sporadic since Monday, when Google canceled its domain name registration, making its IP address nearly impossible for internet users to locate. The site had moved its registration to Google after GoDaddy tweeted late Sunday night that it had given The Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain to another provider. Google then yanked the address as well, citing a violation of its terms of service. We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service. The site briefly reappeared Wednesday with a Russian domain name and registration and a dubious top story, making the unsupported claim that President Donald Trump had called Russian President Vladimir Putin to get the site restored. The story presented no evidence that Mr. Trump or Putin had any involvement in the move and Mr. Trump has no known links to the site. Until mid-day, the site continued to receive performance and security services from San Francisco-based Cloudflare Inc., protecting it from denial of service attacks. Cloudflare said it is cooperating with law enforcement. A company statement called some of the content on Cloudfare's network ""repugnant."" but said withdrawing its services would not remove the website from the internet, just make it slower and more vulnerable to attack. Shortly thereafter, the site that takes its name from Der Stürmer, a newspaper that published Nazi propaganda, disappeared again. Anglin said he was struggling to find a domain registry service whose terms of service allow for the content he produces. ""I have been kicked off of 4 of them so far, and many of them contain explicit references to ""hate speech"" in their ToS. Others would be incapable of managing the DDoS attacks,"" Anglin wrote, expressing frustration with ICANN, the international nonprofit that authorizes domain-name registrars. ""If they don't have a single registrar willing to host me, then they have effectively banned me from registering a domain."" Anglin had been keeping up his inflammatory statements through the Russian domain, mocking Heather Heyer, the woman who was killed when a man remembered for praising Adolph Hitler rammed his car into a crowd of demonstrators in Charlottesville on Saturday. The original story called her, among many other things, ""the definition of uselessness."" But Anglin had other fresh trouble as well: A Muslim-American radio host filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday accusing him of defamation by falsely labeling him the ""mastermind"" of a deadly concert bombing in England. In this June 25, 2015, file photo, Muslim comedian Dean Obeidallah speaks at a news conference in New York. SiriusXM Radio show host Dean Obeidallah said The Daily Stormer embedded fabricated tweets in a June 1 story to make them seem like they had been sent from Obeidallah's Twitter account, tricking readers into believing he took responsibility for the May 22 terrorist attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. The death threats came quickly thereafter. ""It was literally jaw-dropping,"" Obeidallah, a comedian and Daily Beast columnist, told the AP. ""The death threats were something I've never seen before in my life."" The suit claims that the article's defamatory statements were intended to incite violence against Obeidallah, citing other alleged examples of Daily Stormer readers who did just that, including Dylann Roof, who read the site before killing black churchgoers in South Carolina. ""Mr. Obeidallah is an ardent believer in and defender of the First Amendment. He recognizes the importance of freedom of speech and political discourse, regardless of viewpoint. But the First Amendment does not license defamation,"" his suit says. Asked by the AP for comment on the lawsuit, Anglin gave a two-word response: ""Wew lads,"" referring to an internet meme expressing sarcastic fake-surprise and dismissiveness. The Daily Stormer also was sued in April by a Montana woman for orchestrating an anti-Semitic trolling campaign against her family. Tanya Gersh's suit claims anonymous internet trolls bombarded Gersh's family with hateful and threatening messages after Anglin published their personal information in a post accusing her and other Jewish residents of Whitefish, Montana, of engaging in an ""extortion racket"" against the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer. Gersh is represented by attorneys from the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. In July, the law center's lawyers claimed Anglin was ""actively concealing his whereabouts"" and hadn't been served with Gersh's suit. They said they looked for him at four addresses in Franklin County, Ohio, where he apparently has connections. Obeidallah's lawsuit was filed in Columbus, Ohio, since Anglin is an Ohio native who uses a post office box in Worthington, Ohio. A lawyer for Obeidallah said The Daily Stormer hasn't responded to their request to remove the June 1 article about him. Obeidallah is represented by Muslim Advocates, a national legal and educational organization based in Oakland, California."
"President Trump's reaction to the deadly violence at a white nationalist rally in Virginia last weekend drew considerably more disapproval than approval, according to a poll released Wednesday by the Economist and YouGov. Forty-two percent of respondents said they disapprove of the president's response, while only 27 percent said they approve. Thirty-one percent had no opinion. In his first remarks on the violence, the president on Saturday condemned the violence and bigotry ""on many sides"" – a remark widely interpreted as a suggestion of moral equivalency between the white nationalists and the counter-demonstrators. On Monday, the president struck a more unequivocal tone, describing white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, and other hate groups as ""repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans."" But by Tuesday, the president seemed to revert to his initial message, declaring in a combative press conference, ""I think there is blame on both sides."" The violence in Charlottesville claimed three lives over the weekend. A young woman was killed on Saturday when a car driven by a white nationalist plowed through a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators. And a police helicopter that was deployed in response to the ongoing situation crashed later that afternoon, killing two law enforcement officers on board. President Trump defended his response to deadly protests in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend, but ""it is hard to get on other side of n... Respondents in the Economist survey were asked which group is more likely to use violence – white nationalists or the anti-racist demonstrators. Thirty-one percent picked the white nationalists, ten percent picked the counter-protesters, and 45 percent said both groups were equally likely to turn violent. The poll also reflected the dim view most Americans hold of groups under the white nationalist umbrella, including the KKK and neo-Nazis. Only seven percent of respondents said they have a favorable opinion about white nationalists. Six percent said they view the KKK favorably. And only five percent said the same of neo-Nazis. Results were decidedly mixed, however, on questions involving symbols of the Confederacy like the Confederate flag and statues of Confederate leaders. (The situation in Charlottesville was sparked, in part, by the city's plan to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee from a public park.) Forty-three percent of respondents said they see the confederate flag mostly as a symbol of Southern pride, while 38 percent said they see the flag as a symbol of racism. Fifty-four percent said they see the statues of Confederate leaders as symbols of southern pride, and 26 percent said they see those statues as symbols of racism. Only 30 percent of respondents said they approve of Charlottesville's decision to remove the statue of Lee, while 48 percent said they disapprove. According to the survey, the president's approval rating among Americans nationwide stands at 39 percent, and his disapproval rating stands at 51 percent. The Economist poll surveyed 1,500 Americans between August 13 and 15, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent. "
"Mr. Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, tweeted a collage of pictures of himself with African-Americans on Wednesday in the wake of President Trump's much-criticized comments on the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend.  ""As the son of a holocaust survivor, I have no tolerance for #racism,"" Cohen tweeted. ""Just because I support @POTUS @realDonaldTrump doesn't make me a racist."" As the son of a holocaust survivor, I have no tolerance for #racism. Just because I support @POTUS @realDonaldTrump doesn't make me a racist pic.twitter.com/lfIwdosreE The photos in his tweet feature NFL legend Jim Brown, former boxing promoter and vocal Trump supporter Don King as well as Trump White House adviser Omarosa Manigault.  Cohen's tweet received almost immediate backlash from some in the African-American community, including ""Orange is the New Black"" star Danielle Brooks.  Are you just completely dumb? So you thought posting a ton of pics with black ppl makes you non racist? #takingadeepbreath Some also questioned the use of a personal connection to the Holocaust in an effort to defend Mr. Trump after he said said Tuesday that both sides were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville.  Confused: Is Cohen using personal Holocaust connection to defend the prez or distance himself from the prez? I am the son of a holocaust survivor. And yes it does. Cohen proceeded to spend much of Tuesday responding directly to negative tweets he received, saying ""I love all good people regardless of race, religion or color."""
"Last Updated Aug 16, 2017 3:38 PM EDT Attorney General Jeff Sessions singled out Chicago and other so-called sanctuary cities in a speech in Miami on Wednesday, after Chicago announced it will sue the Department of Justice for planning to cut off key law enforcement grants to localities refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Sessions said it is ""not moral or legal"" for local officials to refrain from reporting criminal aliens to federal authorities and to allow such offenders back on the streets. The attorney general said hundreds of thousands of Americans are affected every year by crimes committed by criminals who are in the country illegally, describing several cases in which criminal aliens were accused or convicted of perpetrating violent crimes against U.S. citizens in sanctuary cities. ""The Department of Justice will not concede a single block or street corner in the United States to lawlessness or crime,"" Sessions said. ""Nor will we tolerate the loss of innocent life because a handful of jurisdictions believe that they are above the law."" Sessions urged Chicago and other sanctuary cities to follow the example of Miami-Dade, where he said local officials are in full compliance with requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officials to report and hand over people who are in the country illegally. Sessions linked Chicago's notoriously high violent crimes rates to its sanctuary city policies. ""In Chicago – a city with almost exactly the same 2.7 million person population as Miami-Dade – more than 433 people have been murdered since the beginning of the year,"" the attorney general said in his prepared remarks. ""More than three times as many as Miami-Dade."" But CBS News' Paula Reid reports DOJ has been unable to provide any data supporting the connection between higher crime rates in Chicago and its immigration-related policies.  A memorial was held in honor of Heather Heyer, who died after a car plowed into a protesting crowd in Charlottesville, Virginia. Fran Townsend, C... The attorney general went also off script from his prepared remarks to address the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia -- calling the city ""Charlotte"" by mistake -- to denounce bigotry and praise the local law enforcement response there. Sessions, Reid reports, was one of the most vocal officials in the Trump administration to speak out first against Saturday's violent turn of events.  ""We've had a tough weekend in Charlotte, and um, I know you've all been following that. I want to thank state and local people and federal people that worked so hard since those tragic events there,"" Sessions said.  ""We cannot, and in no way can we accept or apologize for, racism, bigotry, hatred, violence, and those kind of things that too often arise in our country. I would say that the state people were engaged aggressively. Saturday night FBI was interviewing people in Ohio, they're moving aggressively in a collaborative way using the interstate capabilities that the federal agents have as well as on the ground capabilities of our state and local law officers."" The Justice Department is opening a civil rights investigation into the events surrounding Saturday's violence that left one woman, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, dead after a suspected attacker rammed his car into a sea of counter-protesters.  Sessions has been at the forefront of the president's agenda to crack down on crime and illegal immigration. But Mr. Trump has attacked his attorney general on Twitter for supposedly being too soft on leakers in federal agencies, or on former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server at the State Department.  Mr. Trump, asked about his relationship with Sessions last week, said, ""it's fine."" The Attorney General faulted politicians in Chicago, saying they're prioritizing and protecting criminal aliens over law-abiding U.S. citizens. Sessions contrasted Chicago with Miami-Dade and a handful of other localities that are ""choosing the rule of law."" ""So to all 'sanctuary' jurisdictions across the country, I say this: Miami-Dade is doing it, and so can you,"" Sessions said in his prepared remarks.  Sessions said sanctuary cities make themselves the best friends of drug smugglers and violent criminals, saying it is ""not moral or legal"" to refuse to work with federal immigration officials to deport criminal aliens. Local police, he said, are not to blame, rather, local politicians are. Sessions criticized Chicago and its murder rate, mentioning that Chicago just sued the U.S. over the DOJ's decision to pull grant funding for sanctuary cities. The attorney general said millions of Americans are affected every year by crimes committed by illegal aliens, describing several cases in which criminal aliens were accused or convicted of committing violent crimes against U.S. citizens. ""How can these politicians hear this story and do nothing?"" Sessions said.  Sessions took a moment to condemn the bigotry in ""Charlotte,"" instead of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Sessions' prepared remarks urge sanctuary cities to comply with federal immigration authorities, and focus on crime in cities like Chicago. Here is an excerpt from his prepared remarks:  ""During the last administration, the Inspector General sent 10 letters to jurisdictions that they had reason to believe were not complying with federal immigration law. Last week, we sent a letter to your mayor and today I'm here to announce that Miami-Dade is now in full compliance and eligible for federal law enforcement grant dollars. This is wonderful news for law enforcement and the citizens of Miami-Dade.  It means more money for crime fighting. And it means we are partners in keeping everyone here safe. Unfortunately, some cities – like Chicago – refuse to follow your example. In Chicago – a city with almost exactly the same 2.7 million person population as Miami-Dade – more than 433 people have been murdered since the beginning of the year. More than three times as many as Miami-Dade."" Thomas Homan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said there's no reason to keep criminal aliens on the streets. As of July 31, nearly 10,000 criminal aliens released to the streets have committed another crime, he said.  ""Let me be clear. Entering this country illegally is a crime,"" Homan said.  Homan said state and local politicians can't be in the business of ""shielding"" people from the law. "
"Vice President Pence will return to the United States early from his visit to South America, according to Pence's communications director Jarrod Agen. Pence will cut his trip short by one night in order to meet with President Trump and the National Security Team at Camp David on Friday. The group plans ""to discuss the South Asia strategy,"" according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Pence was originally set to leave Panama Friday morning, but instead will leave at 8 p.m. Thursday evening, arriving back in the United States in the early morning. Pence is currently in Chile as part of his foreign visit, where he met with Chilean president Michelle Bachetel on Wednesday. In a briefing with reporters also on Wednesday, which marked his first live comments since Mr. Trump's divisive Charlottesville remarks Tuesday afternoon, Pence was reluctant to agree or disagree with the president that the violent events occurring over that weekend were to blame ""on both sides."" ""What happened in Charlottesville was a tragedy,"" Pence said. ""And the president has been clear on this tragedy and so have I,"" he said, not specifying whether he agreed with Mr. Trump. In his travels Tuesday, the vice president downplayed the possibility for U.S. military intervention in Venezuela at two separate speaking events in Argentina. ""As President Trump said just a few days ago, we have many options for Venezuela,"" Pence said. ""But the president also remains confident that working with all of our allies across Latin America, and across the wider world, that we can achieve a peaceable solution restoring democracy and ending the crisis facing the people of Venezuela. But it will take all of us to do it."""
