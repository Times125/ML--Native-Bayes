An appeals court on Saturday refused a request from two Native American tribes for an  emergency  order that would prevent oil from flowing through .The decision by the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit means the $3.8bn pipeline, set to move  oil to a distribution point in Illinois, could be operating as early as Monday, even as the tribes  lawsuit challenging the project moves forward.The  have challenged an earlier ruling, by US district judge James Boasberg, not to stop final construction of the pipeline. They also wanted the appeals court to halt any oil flow until that case was resolved.The appeals court said the tribes had not met  the stringent requirements  for such an order.The tribes had asked Boasberg to direct the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw permission for Dallas-based developer  Transfer Partners (ETP) to lay pipe under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, which the Corps manages for the US government.The stretch under the Missouri River reservoir is the last piece of construction for the pipeline.The company is wrapping up construction work under the lake and has said oil could start flowing between Monday and Wednesday.The tribes fear the pipeline could harm their water supply and their right to practice their religion, which relies on clean water. ETP disputes that.The tribes  appeal rests on the religion argument. Judge Boasberg has said he does not think the tribes have a strong case on appeal. He also said ETP would be  substantially harmed  by a delay in pipeline operations.
