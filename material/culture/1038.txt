ollowing excellent solo projects, Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland return to their duo Hype Williams, whose cut-up dub songcraft has been one of the most compelling voices in the European underground this decade. Or do they?  says theyïŒre no longer involved, but the pair are known for their inveterate fibbing. Either way, thereïŒs none of BluntïŒs deadpan chat and only a couple of (possibly Copeland-delivered) female vocals, a shame as some of the tracks are pleasingly punchdrunk trip-hop instrumentals that cry out for a top line, however meandering.You could imagine ,  or even Kanye West doing their most freewheeling work over something like Leimert. But the pairïŒs samples are arresting, lurching into tracks like a drunken houseguest, whether itïŒs a phone call about a shady boyfriend or bleak lines recited from Jim CartwrightïŒs play Road æ¯ the result is a fugged, fractious collage. As ever, the most beautiful moments are often the most fleeting, such as Sweet Chin Musik, 30 seconds of synths straining as if through a frost-rimed window.
