Three issues stand out from your coverage of the Nottingham slavery trials (, 12 August).First, despite the increasing amount of information available, most people do not understand that slavery is widespread in the UK, or if they do, don t know how to spot it or what to do about?it.Second, modern-day slavery is found in every form of UK economic activity   food, clothing, social care, fishing, hotels, leisure and construction etc.Third, the requirements on companies to investigate slavery in supply chains are weak. Most aren t required to report on what they are doing to remove slavery from their suppliers, and those that are largely make bland statements describing aspirations rather than actions. It is still too easy for firms, directly or indirectly, to?exploit vulnerable workers.
