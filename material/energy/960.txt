So we in fact reached our goal a year earlier than planned,  said Boon, adding that an increase in the number of wind farms across the country and off the coast of the  had helped NS achieve its aim.Eneco and NS said on a joint website that around 600,000 passengers daily are  the first in the world  to travel thanks to wind energy.
