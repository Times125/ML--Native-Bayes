The draft law was submitted to lawmakers for its first reading at the bimonthly session of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee which runs from Wednesday to July 1. The law aims at "safeguarding cyberspace sovereignty and national security," according to the draft. Cyber security has become an important issue concerning national security and development as well as public interests, said Lang Sheng, deputy head of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee, at the session. The 68-article draft law suggests mechanisms to guarantee the safety of Internet products and services, operation, network data, as well as information. The draft also highlights "development," prescribing national strategies for cyber security and supportive measures to promote cyber security, Lang said. Key information-related infrastructure will be put under protection, according to the draft. The draft also stresses protecting citizens' personal information from being stolen, leaked or used illegally. State Council departments related with cyber security will establish systems for cyber security monitoring, warning and reporting. An emergency response mechanism will also be set up, according to the draft.
