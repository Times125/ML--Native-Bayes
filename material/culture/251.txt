et inside an apartment in war-torn Damascus, this lean thriller feels more like a play than a film. Though the mood is tense and claustrophobic, it s all a little too abrupt. The house s cramped kitchen becomes a makeshift panic room, with nine tenants squashed into one room as gunfire ricochets around the building s exterior. In charge is Oum Yazan (Hiam Abbas), a stern matriarch who protects her ageing father, young children and maid, as well as a neighbour, Halima, and her newborn baby, with the fierceness of a lioness. The apartment is her home and  no one will force me out of it , she declares. In contrast to Yazan s cold fury is the tender rage that spills out of the rosy-cheeked Halima (Diamand Bou Abboud). Abboud s physical performance is particularly brilliant   frightened and fidgety, a startled rabbit fighting for her life. Though it s not gratuitous exactly, at times the film is difficult to watch; director Philippe Van Leeuw captures both the everyday horror of living through war and the lurking threat of sexual violence.
