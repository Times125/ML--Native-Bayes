NEW YORK -- Short-lived White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci says if it were up to him, top adviser Steve Bannon would be gone from President Trump's administration. But, he notes, "It's not up to me." "The Mooch," a few weeks removed from his spectacular flameout following an expletive-laden conversation with a reporter, appeared Monday on CBS' "Late Show" with Stephen Colbert. Colbert has seen his ratings soar since Mr. Trump's inauguration with his relentless comedic attacks. Colbert showed a picture of Scaramucci and former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus glaring at each other. Scaramucci said there was "no love lost" between the two. He said he and Priebus got along well when he was writing checks to the Republican National Committee, which Priebus once led. Bannon's position as the president 's chief strategist may be in jeopardy, two sources close to the White House told CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. There is a growing feeling both inside and outside the White House that Bannon is increasingly falling out of favor with Mr. Trump, with the relationship between the two falling to all-time lows. One source says that Bannon could be gone by the end of the week, Garrett reports. Scaramucci said he knows Mr. Trump "as a compassionate person," while reiterating that he thought the president should have spoken more harshly than he did initially of the white supremacists involved in the violent protest in Charlottesville, Virginia. Of Mr. Trump's frequent off-the-cuff remarks, Scaramucci said, "That's him wearing his heart on his sleeve."
