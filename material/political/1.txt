 Ivanka Trump has spoken at a fundraiser Tuesday night in Washington for Vice President Mike Pence's political committee. That's according to two people who attended the fundraiser and demanded anonymity to share information from the private event. Trump said Pence has been a key ally of the president and that Republicans should begin preparing for the 2018 congressional elections. Pence's political committee can dole out money to his preferred candidates. The first daughter's remarks to a room of donors came as her father attended a political rally in Ohio organized by his 2020 re-election campaign.
