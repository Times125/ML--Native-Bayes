As software defined infrastructures mature and organizations realize the benefits of efficiency and agility, there is increasing awareness of the limitations of physical security systems. Such systems inspect traffic at the perimeter, with limited visibility into virtualized workloads. The complexity of private and hybrid clouds, and growing network traffic, require more fully-featured security solutions to evolve. Enterprises are faced with the challenge of providing consistent security across multiple data center and SDN/cloud technologies. Open Security Controller Project orchestrates the deployment of virtual network security policies, applies the correct policy to the appropriate workload, and it brokers services among cloud management platforms resulting in seamless integration of multi-vendor virtual security controls. Because the project is open, organizations may choose the security and SDN vendors that best meet their needs. "Software-defined networks are becoming a standard for businesses, and open source networking projects are a key element in helping the transition, and pushing for a more automated network" said Arpit Joshipura, General Manager of Networking and Orchestration at The Linux Foundation. "Equally important to automation in the open source community is ensuring security. The Open Security Controller Project touches both of these areas. We are excited to have this project join The Linux Foundation, and look forward to the collaboration this project will engender regarding network security now and in the future." Open Security Controller Project technology is licensed under Apache 2. Governance for the Open Security Controller Project has been structured to nurture a vibrant technical community. A Governing Board will guide business decisions, marketing and ensure alignment between the technical communities and members. The technical steering committee will provide leadership on the code and guide the technical direction of the project. Visit https://www.opensecuritycontroller.org for more information. Industry Support for the Open Security Controller Project "Security orchestration is important to cloud solutions, we are looking forward to working together with The Linux Foundation and industry partners to further enhance security," said Evan Xiao, President, Strategy & Business Development Department, at Huawei Products & Solutions "At Intel we are committed to security, from the hardware root of trust through the compute stack, the network infrastructure and to cloud and emerging workloads," said Rick Echevarria, Vice President, Software and Services Group and General Manager, Platforms Security Division at Intel. "Our contribution of the Open Security Controller to the Linux Foundation will help accelerate the adoption of software-defined security, as demonstrated by the participation of the other founding members who are among leaders in the delivery of security solutions." "The Nuage Networks Virtualized Service Platform (VSP) is an SDN solution that helps enterprise customers transform their IT operation to be  more agile, secure and responsive to ever-changing business requirements" said Hussein Khazaal, VP of Marketing & Partnerships at Nuage Networks from Nokia. "Today, we are pleased to see the Open Security Controller become a Linux Foundation project and have Nuage Networks from Nokia be one of the founding members that are eager to accelerate and help centralize security services orchestration for multi-cloud environments. We continue to be advocates of community collaborations and offering IT organizations with solutions that will help them with their digital transformations" Organizations can embrace software defined infrastructure with greater confidence, Open Security Controller Project optimizes security resources to deliver agile security, regardless of vendor, where it's needed and when it's needed.
