Still goes off every time. I donïŒt think itïŒll ever get old: it has aged beautifully, like a fine wine.This is the sickest remix of anything anyone has done for a while. We never really do rewinds but if we did weïŒd probably never get past this tune.This has just come out, so thereïŒs definitely a chance itïŒll happen. I dunno if the world is ready for the whole country-trap fusion thing but it really should be.Khalid is mad talented, I love all the stuff heïŒs been putting out recently. ; the vocals are so on point.We always bump this on the tour bus just to get in the zone. Nothing like some raging flamenco music before you gotta go on stage.This tune feels so majestic. Such chill old-school vibes, makes me ready to go get it.Definitely one of my favourite tunes to come out this year. Kali and Jorja killed it.I love this tune, but I remember one time accidentally dropping the clean version in a club. So many of the words are different and it was really embarrassing.IïŒd play this at any wedding. All-time classic.
