here is a scene in the first 20 minutes of Jairus McLeary and Gethin Aldous s observational documentary  where a grown man cries. It s no ordinary cry; this is a full-body sob; a keening wail bottled up for literally years; the desperate, feral cry of someone in unimaginable pain. He wants to feel what it s like to mourn for his sister.  Take me with you,  says one of the man s colleagues when he bites his lip, trying not to surrender to the tears.  I m not going anywhere.  And so they come, in floods. Watching this scene is a visceral experience. Some moments are unbearable to watch; others are utter catharsis.At Folsom state prison, a medium security institution in California, inmates and members of the public come together twice a year for an intensive four-day group therapy session. Bartenders, museum associates and teaching assistants sit with former members of gangs and cults, and scary-looking guys who used to belong to the . All must leave their preconceptions at the door to deal with daddy issues, addiction, grief, depression and suicidal thoughts. The breakthroughs come in waves; there s no third-act climax or big reveal, just a steady stream of broken people struggling to summon the strength to put themselves back together.  Right down next to where we hurt the most is our medicine,  says one of the group s facilitators, explaining that vulnerability is the key to healing. Sceptics may enter Folsom with suspicion, but these are extraordinary scenes, so shocking and dynamic they might be mistaken for exorcisms. Whether you buy into the techniques on display or not, it s a privilege to witness these men take themselves, and one another,  over the edge .
