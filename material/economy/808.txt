This year 9 August will mark ten years since the world experienced the worst global  since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The FTSE lost 121 points that day, and in the US the Dow Jones average fell by 387. Central bankers became so alarmed by banks  reluctance to lend to each other that they took emergency action; the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve injected a combined $90bn into financial markets. The summer of 2007 also saw the UK s first bank run in 150 years when customers queued outside Northern Rock to withdraw their savings. We would like to hear your memories of the credit crunch.
