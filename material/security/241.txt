SINGAPORE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Ministry of Defence will set up a cyber command to enhance its defense capabilities against cyber attacks, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen announced in Parliament on Friday. The new cyber command, the Defence Cyber Organisation (DCO), will be in charge of developing policies and strategies for cyber security, improving the military's cyber defense capabilities and also support the national Cyber Security Agency if necessary. Ng said a new Cyber Defence Group will also be formed. It will have two operational units around the clock to monitor the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) networks, and a Cyber Test and Evaluation Centre. The defense ministry also ropes in National Servicemen to play a part in the new cyber-defense vocation. The ministry hopes to groom a pool of about 2,600 cyber defenders from those who are doing National Service to be operationally ready to fulfill this duty in the next decade. In order to strengthen the SAF's training for cyber defense, a memorandum of understanding will be signed with Singapore Technologies Electronics (Info-Security) and Nanyang Polytechnic in March, according to local media. Personal data of servicemen and employees of the defense ministry were reported stolen in a breach earlier this month.
