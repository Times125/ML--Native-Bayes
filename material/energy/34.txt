Venezuelans lost half an hour of sleep on Sunday as their clocks were moved forward to save power at the order of President .At 2:30 am local time, the oil-dependent South American nation shifted its clocks forward by 30 minutes, to four hours behind Greenwich Mean Time. The move, announced in mid-April, was part of a package of measures the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) member nation is pursuing to cope with a crippling electricity shortage.Maduro s socialist government has allowed rolling blackouts, a reduced work week of two days for public sector workers and the closure of schools on Friday to try to save electricity. Maduro has blamed  for the lack of rain that has reduced the lakes at Venezuela s hydroelectric dams to oversized puddles. The drought   the most severe in 40 years   has especially affected the El Guri dam, which provides 70% of Venezuela s electricity.In announcing the clock change, the science and technology minister, Jorge Arreaza, said the night-time use of lighting and air conditioning was especially draining for the power grid.  It ll be simple to move the clock forward a half hour   this will allow us to enjoy more daylight and it won t get dark so early,  he said.Maduro s late predecessor, also with the goal of saving power. Chavez died in 2013., which once boomed as the country with the world s largest proven oil reserves, has plunged into economic chaos as global oil prices collapsed. Its economy has been in recession since 2013.Venezuelans face acute shortages of basics including toilet paper thanks to the scarcity of dollars needed for imports. The government imposed currency controls in 2003 to stifle a bustling black market in dollars.With most of Venezuela s hard currency revenue coming from oil exports, the lower oil prices make dollars even harder to obtain than before the crisis.
