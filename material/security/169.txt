KIGALI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda Information Society Authority (RISA) Monday pledged stronger cooperation with the public in enhancing cyber security for all computers in Rwanda following reports of an outbreak of a security attack that has affected over 150 countries. The cyber security attack is known as ransomware, bearing different variations like WannaCrypt, WannaCry, WannaCryptor or Wcrya. The cyber-attack mostly affects computers that run Microsoft Operating Systems, by automatically encrypting the files and blocking the user's access. "As we globally face this challenge in cyber security, as a country we strongly believe that an integrated strategy to ensure effective regulation to our cyber security is significant at this point," said the statement. "Users are required to maintain daily backups of critical data including application, databases, mails systems, and user's files. Backups should be regularly tested for data restoration," it said. It also urged installation of all computers with latest security updates. Other precautions include configuring the LAN perimeter firewall with a rule to block all incoming SMB traffic on port 445, upgrading all computers to Windows 10 to benefit from the latest protection from Microsoft. "The Windows Defender Antivirus, which can detect the above malware, should also be enabled on all Windows systems. Ensure your Antivirus signatures are up to date as major vendors are all working to deliver updated signatures to detect/ prevent this," it said. It also cautioned all users against opening any suspicious email especially one that have an attachment, or downloading any files that they are not sure of the source. RISA reaffirmed commitment to address the threat to cyber security and encouraged the public to fully collaborate in order to minimize any negative impact.
