 comic road movie flings together two mismatched stepbrothers (Jack Parry-Jones, Christy O Donnell) and a charismatic girl (Tara Lee) on a journey from Shetland to Glasgow, with sexual tensions threatening to derail the journey. Unfortunately, this underpowered story is neither funny nor sexy enough to generate much narrative momentum. Lee s effortlessly cool Caitlin is the film s strongest presence; of the teenage?boys, Michael (Parry-Jones) is too irritating and Thor?(Christy O Donnell) too inert to justify spending much time in their company. Music   both Thor and Caitlin are musicians   should be one of the stars of the film, but it feels more like glue than a character.
