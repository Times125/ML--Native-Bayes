Fresh evidence of the impact of the post-Brexit depreciation in the value of the pound will be revealed on Tuesday with the release of the latest set of official inflation figures.City analysts believe there will have been a pause in June in the steady increase in the cost of living to 2.9% in the 12 months since the EU referendum, but most believe the respite will prove temporary.And with annual earnings growth at 2%, the release of the latest inflation data from the Office for National Statistics is likely to prompt renewed speculation about a slowdown in consumer demand caused by prices rising faster than wages. was running at 0.6% when the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 but it has risen subsequently as a result of higher oil prices and dearer imports caused by the 12% decline in the value of the pound over the past 12 months.That has taken the annual inflation rate to its highest level in and close to the level where , the governor of the Bank of England, would be forced to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, explaining why Threadneedle Street had failed to keep the annual increase in the cost of living to within one percentage point of the government s 2% target.Consumer spending helped keep the economy expanding strongly in the six months after the  vote, but the growth rate slipped to 0.2% in the first three months of 2017.Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation was likely to peak at 3.2% later in the year even though the July figure would show no change.Tombs said the recent fall in global oil prices would help motorists by reducing the cost of motoring, while smaller increases in air fares, and toys and games in June 2017 than in the same month a year earlier would also dampen inflationary pressure. Food inflation, however, is continuing to grind higher in response to sterling s collapse,  Tombs said. Victoria Clarke, UK analyst at Investec, said the impact of air fares was likely to shave 0.1 points off the annual inflation rate to 2.8%, but said this did not mark a turning point.  We actually see inflation climbing a touch further to 3% later this summer and holding around that level until year end. But Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital , said the squeeze on consumers would be nowhere near as pronounced or as prolonged as it was after sterling s last major depreciation in 2008. With the effects of the lower pound appearing to be fading at the start of the production line, CPI inflation looks to have almost peaked already and we think that it will gradually start to head down towards the 2% target from next year,  she said.  Meanwhile, there are reasons to think that nominal wage growth should start to pick up in the quarters ahead, as higher inflation makes it more difficult for employers to award lower wage rises, a gradual pick-up in productivity growth improves firms  ability to grant larger pay increases and the past tightening in the labour market leads to at least some strengthening in pay growth.
