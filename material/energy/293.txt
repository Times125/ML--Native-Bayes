The  premier, Mike Baird, says if the federal government knocks back the sale of the state electricity distributor Ausgrid to a Chinese  company another bidder will step in.Baird told reporters on Tuesday national interest and national security concerns were ultimately matters for the federal government in assessing foreign investment transactions, not the state government. It s now up to them to decide,  Baird said.  I can assure you that, even if they take a decision that they don t want any particular bidder to proceed, there are a number of bidders that would be interested in these assets. They are great assets, great opportunity. What is important is the number of funds that become available for the infrastructure we are building. Baird s comments follow a  by the treasurer, Scott Morrison, on Monday that national security was the paramount concern with the proposed sell-off.NSW is  of Ausgrid as part of privatising the state s electricity infrastructure.There are two bidders, China s largest state-owned company, the State Grid Corporation of China, and the privately owned, Hong Kong-listed Cheung Kong Infrastructure, controlled by the billionaire Li Ka-shing.The NSW government has previously moved to play down concerns about the small number of bidders lining up for the electricity distributor.The proposed sell off has attracted considerable interest among cross benchers in the new federal parliament.Nick Xenophon has raised national security concerns directly with Morrison and Bob Katter has flagged a private member s bill to stop the sale of Ausgrid to State Grid, given it is a state owned enterprise.The new One Nation bloc is also signalling opposition to foreign investment.The treasurer has said federal authorities are currently in the final stages of consideration about the proposal.
