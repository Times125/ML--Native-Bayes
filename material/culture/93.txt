, or  (translating more accurately as  competition  in its original French), documents the rigorous admissions process of prestigious Parisian film school La F mis, once home to Alain Resnais, Arnaud Desplechin and Claire Denis (and director Claire Simon, who used to teach there). The film s effectiveness relies on some external understanding of the school s standing. Or perhaps the lack of context is part of Simon s plan to subtly criticise the fact that its clout is taken for granted   and its selection method, subjective to the point of arbitrary. Wide-eyed prospective students take three entrance tests (written, practical and oral), with each individual s merits and failings exhaustively debated at each stage by the school s teachers. He did that well!  comments one teacher after watching an applicant s screen test.  I was falling asleep,  argues another.  Help! Don t come to La F mis! Get a life!  sneers a professor to her colleague after watching a boy  masturbating  to his own rushes. An interview panel grills a girl from Ivory Coast with personal questions about her family background and her political ambitions ( the cinema is more effective at conveying ideas than politicians ) before bamboozling her with the simple question:  What films do you like?  Naturally, her mind goes blank.Simon s fly-on-the-wall mode is a distancing tool, but shouldn t be confused with ambivalence. Exposing the mechanics of decision-making is an implicit reproof of increasing conservatism, both of La F mis itself and the film-makers they are producing.
