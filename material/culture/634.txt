ollowing excellent solo projects, Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland return to their duo Hype Williams, whose cut-up dub songcraft has been one of the most compelling voices in the European underground this decade. Or do they?  says they re no longer involved, but the pair are known for their inveterate fibbing. Either way, there s none of Blunt s deadpan chat and only a couple of (possibly Copeland-delivered) female vocals, a shame as some of the tracks are pleasingly punchdrunk trip-hop instrumentals that cry out for a top line, however meandering.You could imagine ,  or even Kanye West doing their most freewheeling work over something like Leimert. But the pair s samples are arresting, lurching into tracks like a drunken houseguest, whether it s a phone call about a shady boyfriend or bleak lines recited from Jim Cartwright s play Road   the result is a fugged, fractious collage. As ever, the most beautiful moments are often the most fleeting, such as Sweet Chin Musik, 30 seconds of synths straining as if through a frost-rimed window.
