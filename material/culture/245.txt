ersistent drizzle and umbrella-wrecking winds are not the best weather for a waterborne 30th birthday party, but  s celebration went ahead regardless. The ensemble was conceived in 1987 by Simon Rattle as a new-music offshoot of the , and though many of its players are current or former members of the orchestra, it has carved out a niche as one of the UK s leading specialist ensembles.The specially commissioned birthday piece was a collaborative effort between three composers, resulting in a canal serenade to be performed on narrowboats at the convergence of three of Birmingham s main waterways in the centre of the city.  contributed Music for Barges, in which a solo trombonist (Tony Howe of BCMG) summoned electronic responses (supplied by Beast, Birmingham University s resident electronic ensemble) from loudspeakers on three boats approaching the junction from different directions.  s Share the Space was a setting for voices () and percussion of words taken from canalside signage, while  s Birmingham Canal Songs, with tenor  accompanied by accordion and percussion, set a specially commissioned poem by  evoking life on the canals.The three pieces were interleaved, but it seemed rather disjointed and never really coalesced into a convincing musical experience. The weather made sure of that. The call-and-response effects of Kyriakides  composition disappeared into the wind, while the sight of the members of Ex Cathedra muffled in waterproofs, and Andreas Borregaard playing his accordion from under a plastic poncho just about summed things up.BCMG returned to more familiar   and drier   territory in the CBSO Centre for the second half of the celebration, a short programme, conducted by Emilio Pom rico, that was something of a manifesto for the group s new artistic director . There was another piece by Ad mek, Sinuous Voices, which translates vocal lines   a Czech prayer and a New Caledonian lullaby   into strikingly bold instrumental writing, and a wonderfully volatile performance of   Into the Blue, teetering between high-register and gravelly grumblings in the extreme bass. Best of all was the most lucid performance that I ve heard of  s  ...zwei Gef hle... , Musik mit Leonardo, with Peter Hoare and Paul Carey Jones as the perfectly dovetailed speakers, and tinglingly precise instrumental playing under Pom rico.
