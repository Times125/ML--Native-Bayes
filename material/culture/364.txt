he suitcase on stage is old and battered, with a fraying rope handle. It is unremarkable, but the way it is burnished by the light makes it glisten like something precious. It is as tempting as gold to Timi (Siyabonga Thwala) who is down on his luck in 1950s  after moving from a rural village to the city with his young wife, Namhla (Masasa Mbangeni). When these bewildered country bumpkins arrive in Durban, their eyes grow round as saucers. They react to the disembodied voice of the train-station announcer as if it is God s. They are dependent on the kindness of strangers, and initially their luck holds, but soon their dream begins to tarnish. As the daily toll of seeking work during the brutal apartheid regime starts to affect their relationship, Timi feels more and more humiliated and Namhla s optimistic chant that  tomorrow the sun must rise  sounds not just hollow but taunting. So he takes a chance and seizes an opportunity that may well be their salvation. s 1954 short story was born out of the horrors of apartheid but is a hymn to people living on the edge and dreaming of a better life. Threaded through with the exquisite music and songs of    sometimes joyful, often keening and sorrowful   this simple piece of storytelling theatre speaks to anyone who has ever felt that they have failed themselves and their family. It is a show that curls back on itself like a snake, and if James Ngcobo s production for  is sometimes overly leisurely and a little too studied, it makes up for it with an appealing, uncluttered directness. What initially appears charming turns out to have a real, if not totally unexpected, sting in the tail. The leads are touching, and there is fine support from Desmond Dube and Nhlanhla John Lata but one of the pleasures of the evening is Wesley France s moody lighting, which conjures temptation glinting in the despairing shadows.
