A multibillion-dollar bidding war for most of Rio Tinto s Australian coalmines has broken out between China-backed Yancoal and Glencore after the Swiss commodities company made an unexpected offer., is exiting coalmining in Australia at a time of falling prices and market volatility.The Anglo-Australian firm in January said it was selling Coal & Allied to Yancoal Australia   which is majority controlled by China s Yanzhou , one of China s largest mining groups by market capitalisation   for US$2.45bn.But , which already owns mines near the Coal & Allied assets in New South Wales, has jumped into the fray, offering US$100m more, Rio Tinto said in a statement. The  board and management will give the proposal appropriate consideration and respond in due course,  the miner said Saturday.The Yancoal deal permitted Rio to look at other offers if they were considered superior.Glencore said it would also buy Mitsubishi s minority stakes in some of the mines for US$920m if the Rio deal went through. Glencore said the Rio purchase  would unlock large-scale mining and operating synergies  and gave the miner until 26 June to accept its fully funded proposal. Glencore s combined portfolio of mines in the Hunter Valley would have production capacity of 81m tonnes per annum of high-energy coal that feeds increasing Asian demand for high-efficiency, low-emission coal,  it said.The Glencore proposal is subject to Australian regulatory approval. Yancoal has already been given the green light for its deal by Australia s Foreign Investment Review Board.Yancoal already operates several mines across the country, including in NSW, while Glencore operates 18 open-cut and underground coalmines in Australia.Glencore, which in 2016 had revenues of US$177.4bn, in May approached the US agribusiness firm Bunge about a possible combination, a sign the firm had turned a corner after a two-year slump in commodity prices.The downturn had prompted , to scrap dividends, sell assets and trim debt.
