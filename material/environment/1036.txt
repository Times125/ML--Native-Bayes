utterflies are ubiquitous in our culture, via dresses, prints, cards and tattoos, but the humble caterpillar is surely overdue a revival. Whenever I ve paused by a sizeable nettle patch this year, I ve found them   writhing balls of black peacock caterpillars and black-and-fluorescent-lime small tortoiseshells. Less conspicuous are red admirals, which neatly stitch together two sides of nettle leaf and live inside a little tent.I ve seen Twitter pictures of  that had harboured hundreds of caterpillars, which will now never become butterflies.  would halt such destruction.The Victorians knew far more about caterpillars than we do because so many people reared their own. Although these specimens were killed when they emerged from their pupae to provide pristine butterflies for collections, Christian collectors (butterfly collecting was a genteel sport, perfectly befitting rural clergymen) saw themselves in the miracle of metamorphosis. Caterpillars were toiling, greedy earthbound creatures, like humans. If these wriggling maggots could ascend to the heavens via a coffin-like chrysalis, then so could we.Today, children remain the true connoisseurs of caterpillars, and last week I collected some for my son s forest school and for my animal-obsessed daughters. Some children are taught not to touch caterpillars but most have a keen sense of what it is to be one   via Eric Carle s classic book    and make empathic caterpillar wranglers (like the hero of Henrietta Rose-Innes  recent novel,    a welcome appearance for that rare species, the humane pest controller).I ve not hung out with caterpillars since childhood and I d forgotten what fabulous pets they are: busy, and oddly personable. The forest school class loved having caterpillars trotting up their arms, and solicitously ensured they were returned to their nettles. At home, we pick fresh nettles every day for our four small tortoiseshells. It s splendid to watch them dive into the fresh leaves with all the ardour of a hungry dog at its bowl. Last night I feared one motionless  cat  had died, but this morning it had completed its elegant brown chrysalis. Over the next few weeks this container will produce a multicoloured winged insect by magic every bit as miraculous as a witch s cauldron.The picture of a  on a beach in southern France is as joyous a sign of the changing seasons as harvest time. I m calling it early, but this story marks the start of silly season 2017 (not least because the photo actually dates from last year).Our need for a break from the 24-hour news cycle is especially acute this year. As exhausted politicians slip away to boar-infested beaches, they will be replaced by an equally dubious cast of characters   dog-snatching seagulls, rogue wallabies on the run, Triffid-style sunflowers, and Vladimir Putin performing heroic holidaymaking for the cameras (my money s on subduing a feral beast that brings to mind Donald Trump). So sit back, relax, and let the animals take over.As Sixtus Dominic Boniface Christopher Rees-Mogg   sixth child of the Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg   makes his way in the world, social media is awash with . There s combining the surnames of your History and English teachers with the last home county you visited   or taking your favourite monarch, adding both parents  middle names followed by your favourite French word and favourite cheese.
