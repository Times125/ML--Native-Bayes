AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka is calling out President Trump's manufacturing council?just one day after he announced he was resigning from the group, citing the council's ineffectiveness and Mr. Trump's most recent statements regarding the hate-group-driven clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia. "The labor movement has forever been at the tip of the spear in ending racism and bigotry, we think it's not acceptable to even tolerate racism and bigotry, let alone defend it, encourage it and aid and abet it," Trumka said on "CBS This Morning" on Wednesday.

Trumka said that because the president gave a defense of hate-based organizations, "it became too much for us to be associated with that."

Now, Trumka says, the labor movement will continue to "reject any notion of legitimacy for groups like the white nationalists, the Ku Klux Klan and other like-minded groups because we don't see any legitimacy to a group that their founding principle is racism and bigotry."
