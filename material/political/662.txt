Nearly two-thirds of Americans say they support same-sex marriage, according to a Pew Research Center survey released Monday. The poll, which comes two years after the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, found that 62 percent support it now and 32 percent oppose it. Views on the issue have significantly changed over the last decade. In 2007, 54 percent of the public opposed it and 37 percent supported it, Pew said. Even last March, 55 percent said they support it while 37 percent opposed it. Majorities of both Baby Boomers and black people now support same-sex marriage, the poll found. The level of support among both demographics has risen by at least 10 percentage points over the last year. Meanwhile, Republicans remain divided with 48 percent of them and those who lean that way opposing same-sex marriage and 47 percent supporting it. Sixty-three percent of moderate and liberal Republicans said they favor it while 39 percent of conservative Republicans said they are against it. In 2013, 61 percent of Republicans opposed it compared to a third who backed it. The survey polled 2,504 adults between June 8 and 18 with a 2.3 percentage point margin of error.
