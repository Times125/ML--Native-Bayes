he  s album tally reaches 20 with this release, and appropriately it s one of his finest, an exquisitely played distillation of standards from both sides of the Atlantic, with a brace of originals for ballast. Well-worn favourites like Rufford Park Poachers and Blues Run the Game are presented in polished form, with Simpson s virtuoso guitar and banjo tailored and layered by producer Andy Bell, plus classy guest accompaniments. Highlights include a cavernous version of Emily Portman s Bones and Feathers, while Maps is a glance back at a 1950s childhood and Ridgeway evokes England s ancient past. A master musician on top of his game.
