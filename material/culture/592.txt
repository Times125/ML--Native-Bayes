n the five years since electronic duo TNGHT    and Canadian producer    released their self-titled EP before announcing an indefinite hiatus, Mohawke has worked with artists such as Kanye West; Lunice has taken a more low-key route. Unfortunately, his debut solo album is largely underwhelming, especially for what s described as a  theatrical showcase . It s industrial, but somehow not abrasive enough; ominous, but in an almost cheesy rather than menacing way. There are striking moments   Drop Down bubbles with rapper  s playful flow and  s additional production, while Distrust seethes spaciously. The elements are there but never really draw you in. Overall, doesn t quite add up.
