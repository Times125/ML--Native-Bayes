od ly s Missa Brevis had its premiere in the cloakroom of the opera house in war-torn Budapest in 1945, with gunshots sounding in the streets outside. Poulenc s Mass in G was written in 1937, when the composer was rediscovering his heavily scented religious faith:  I like an austerity that smells of orange blossom or jasmine,  he said, which could be a description of this work. These two contrasting masses and Jan cek s Lord s Prayer (Ot?e n ?) are sung with characteristic  European  ripeness of tone and precision by the choir of St John s College, Cambridge, with Joseph Wicks and Glen Dempsey (organ) and Anne Denholm (harp). Excellent notes, too, from Richard Bratby and director Andrew Nethsingha.  from this top collegiate choir.
