wo non-fiction books about death impressed the critics this month. Robert McCrumïŒs  is â»proof, yet again, that death makes for lively readingÂ§, wrote  in the Spectator; â»witty, companionable and compulsively readable ïŒ [bringing] evidence that however bleak, however short the time left, it is never too late to be surprised by joyÂ§. The Sunday TimesïŒs  admitted that it â»might sound pretty dismal, but McCrumïŒs investigative spirit takes hold of the narrative and keeps pathos at bay ïŒ this is a brave bookÂ§, and even (like McCrum, a stroke survivor), who â»worried that [the book] might be unremittingly bleakÂ§, was â»encouraged and fortifiedÂ§ in the Mail on Sunday. In the New Statesman, found it a â»beautifully contemplative account of what it means to be dying, as we all are, in the midst of life ïŒ There is not a single story that he tells, no matter how grave, that is not made joyous by the fine attention of his writing and its judicious and intelligent use of quotation and literary and scientific material.Â§Reviewers were equally moved by Maggie OïŒFarrellïŒs , a memoir of her 17 brushes with death æ¯ from childhood illness to an encounter with a murderer on a remote hilltop. â»Each chapter is an accomplished piece of memoir-writing in its own right. The cumulative effect is extraordinary and I felt my understanding of what it means to be a human and a mother grew,Â§ wrote  in the Times. â»Where other writers may be playing with paper, OïŒFarrell takes up a bow and arrow and aims at the human heart.Â§ It was â»ingenious and original ïŒ a rich celebration of every breath OïŒFarrellïŒs takenÂ§, according to  in the Independent and â»extraordinary ïŒ uncomfortable and compelling æ¯ a page-turner ïŒ fluent, poised and packed with colourful detailsÂ§ according to  in the Observer. In the Irish Times,  hailed it as â»electric ïŒ [it] should be read by everyone working with sick children ïŒ By stripping herself of the storytelling apparatus of her novels æ¯ or perhaps by applying that storytelling apparatus directly to her life æ¯ OïŒFarrell has arrived at something more affecting: wise, terrifying, vital and important.Â§ïŒs ninth collection, , did not disappoint. The ObserverïŒs  praised his â»considerable facility for voiceÂ§ while the Daily MailïŒs  enjoyed the charactersïŒ â»interior dialogues, recited in a brilliantly realised Scottish vernacularÂ§. â»Some of them are bleak, but not all; there are some moments of joy,Â§ wrote the ScotsmanïŒs . â»Kelman has always been a true and honest writer, which is why he is one of the fairly few who really matter.Â§ In the Irish Independent, the collectionïŒs darkness was a strength. â»These little nuggets are more like philosophical essays about what it means to be alive. Or, seen from another angle, what it means to be on a slow road to death,Â§ wrote . â»KelmanïŒs vision of the world is bleak æ¯ but redemption is forthcoming ïŒ Uncompromising in vision, and yet strangely adaptable in style and content, KelmanïŒs harsh tales of dirty realism have sympathy for how suffering is a central component of the human condition. This collection shows a writer who is still at the top of his game, brimming with creativity, vitality and artistic integrity.Â§
