Toshiba has been forced to buy out the French utility Engie from a project to build three nuclear reactors in Moorside, northwest England, further . Engie said on Tuesday it was exercising its right to sell its 40% stake in the NuGen venture to Toshiba following the bankruptcy of the Japanese firm s Westinghouse nuclear power plant business.  will pay 15.3 billion yen ($138.5m) for the stake.Toshiba is now the sole owner of NuGen, but has said it is looking for more investors to join the $15-20bn project or to sell out altogether. The UK needs investment in new infrastructure to replace ageing coal and nuclear plants due to close in the 2020s, but has struggled to get large projects built, especially nuclear, due to the costs involved. EDF s  18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear project in Somerset got the final go-ahead in 2016 after several years of delay, but only after securing backing from the French government. The British government has been working to attract new investors to NuGen, and some analysts said Engie s departure might make it easier for Toshiba to sell NuGen as a whole. Korea Electric Power Corp (Kepco) is a potential investor: its chief executive said last month it was in talks to buy a stake in NuGen.Britain s energy minister is currently in South Korea for talks on future collaboration between the two countries, including nuclear projects, a government spokeswoman said.  NuGen has been working tirelessly to bring in additional investment to support the Moorside project,  said a spokesman for the venture.  was as  an event of default  that allowed Engie to exercise its option to sell its stake to Toshiba, the Japanese firm said. Toshiba added the $139m purchase price was equivalent to what Engie had invested in NuGen or the open market value of the stake. Toshiba paid $139m in late 2013 when it purchased a 50% stake in NuGen from Spain s Iberdrola.
