Some Apple (AAPL, Tech30) users have discovered a bug that automatically corrects the lower-case letter "i" to "A" and a question mark symbol. The issue appears to impact iPhone users on its most recent mobile software, iOS 11.1. The new software launched last Tuesday and features hundreds of new emoji. Not surprisingly, the bug is frustrating many Apple users. "WHY does my #iphone keep changing the letter "i" to I ?! HELP," tweeted one user. "I had to turn off my auto correct which is super annoying," wrote another iPhone user on Apple's discussion forum. @AppleSupport my brand new IPhone 8 is trying to autocorrect I? to A?.... googled it and it's apparently happening to new software users pic.twitter.com/7lnsNsxTxy  Although Apple hasn't officially updated the software to correct the issue, it suggested on its website a way for users to fix it themselves. Users can access the Keyboard settings and add a text replacement. "For Phrase, type an upper-case 'I,'" Apple explains. "For Shortcut, type a lower-case 'i.'"
