Lancashire residents fighting to block a fracking site have said they are  truly dismayed  after losing a high court legal challenge.The Preston New Road Action Group and Gayzer Frackman, a professional clown, had of the government s decision to approve Cuadrilla drilling for shale gas in Fylde. The group had argued five points of law had been breached. But Mr Justice Dove on Wednesday dismissed the case, which had hoped to overturn  despite the county council rejecting permission in 2015.Preston New Road Action Group said it would take legal advice on its options and vowed not to give up. Claire Stephenson, a member of the group, said:  Justice and democracy have not been observed in Lancashire. We are truly dismayed at this decision.  Greenpeace said Lancashire residents  opposition to fracking had been overruled.  Ordinary members of the community have been peacefully opposing fracking for six years and they won t stop now,  said Elisabeth Whitebread, the group s energy campaigner.The preparatory work by Cuadrilla at the site has been met by daily protests. In the last fortnight, activists have staged a series of protests targeting suppliers to the site and public relations companies representing the industry.Cuadrilla welcomed the judge s decision, calling it great news for local businesses. , said:  We are very pleased that the planning inspector s recommendation and the secretary of state s decision to grant planning consent has been upheld by the high court. We respected the democratic right of those opposed to this consent to challenge the secretary of state s decision. The drilling rig for the wells is expected to arrive within weeks. The process of hydraulic fracturing, which involves water, sand and chemicals being pumped underground at high pressure to release gas trapped in shale, is not expected to begin until later in the summer.
