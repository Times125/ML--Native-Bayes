Selfie editing tool Facetune ($3.99), which lets users touch-up photos. Apple did not disclose how many times the apps have been downloaded. Bitmoji soared to the top of the list, thanks to an integration with Snapchat. (Snapchat's parent company acquired Bitmoji last year for an unknown amount). The app lets users create a 2D emoji that looks and dresses like them. Bitmojis can be sent within the Snapchat app or via text message. Users must download the Bitmoji app to use it with Snapchat. Fittingly, the main Snapchat app took second place, despite a tough year on Wall Street that was attributed to slow user growth. Snapchat was the most downloaded app of 2016. Google's (GOOG) YouTube took the number three spot this year, while Facebook's (FB) Messenger and Instagram placed fourth and fifth, respectively.
