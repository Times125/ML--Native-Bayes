Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) announced plans for a second headquarters in September, sending cities into a frenzy. The company expects to invest more than $5 billion to build the facility and will create as many as 50,000 "high-paying" jobs.

Kansas City Mayor Sly James wrote five-star reviews for 1,000 random items on Amazon's website; Tucson sent Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos a giant cactus; and New York City lit up landmarks like the Empire State Building in "Amazon orange." Amazon estimates that its investments in Seattle from 2010 through 2016 resulted in an additional $38 billion to the city's economy. Proposals for HQ2 were due last week.
