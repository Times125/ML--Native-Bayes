Former Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday deflected questions about whether he plans to run for president in 2020. "My focus now, our focus now, is to get a Democratic Congress elected in 2018," he said at an event called OZY Fest in New York City's Central Park, according to video uploaded by The Hill newspaper. Katie Couric interviewed his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, on stage at the event, and also threw a question about his future to Joe Biden in the audience. "There's a lot of talent in the Democratic Party," he said. "My hope and expectation is that some of the younger folks are going to come up and they're going to fill that void. "But if they don't... Jill's running," he joked. In May, Biden left the door open to a 2020 run, but suggested it was unlikely. "I may very well do it," Biden said at a SALT hedge fund conference in Las Vegas, according to CNN. "Could I? Yes. Would I? Probably not." He then launched a new political action committee called American Possibilities PAC, which is dedicated to electing people who believe the U.S. is about dreaming big. In June, Biden's brother Frank said in an interview that the former vice president "absolutely" has enough energy for another presidential run. "Why anyone would think otherwise, I don't know," he said. "And there are a whole lot of people down here in Florida looking forward to it." If he were to run in four years, Biden would turn 78 years old just after the election. He served as President Obama's vice president from 2009 until this past January. He previously served in the Senate from 1973 until 2009. He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008.
