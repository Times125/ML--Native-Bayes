Both U2 and Ed Sheeran have cancelled concert dates in St Louis over security concerns amid .The Irish band were booked to play at The Dome at America s Center on Saturday night, while English singer Sheeran had sold-out a Sunday night show at the Scottrade Center. Police say they cannot guarantee the typical level of security as the city faces ongoing protests.Hundreds protested on Friday and Saturday in downtown St Louis, in an upscale section of town and in well-to-do suburbs, leading to at least 32 arrests. More protests were expected Saturday night.U2 s singer Bono, in a statement posted on Instagram, said he was  deeply saddened at what has happened in St Louis and having to cancel our show tonight.  I found myself reading Dr King s speech from the National Cathedral and asking myself is this 1968 or 2017? A statement from U2 s concert promoter, Live Nation, said  We have been informed by the St Louis police department that they are not in a position to provide the standard protection for our audience as would be expected for an event this size. We have also been informed that local crowd security personnel would not be at full capacity. On U2 s website it says they  cannot in good conscience risk our fans  safety by proceeding with tonight s concert. As much as we regret having to cancel, we feel it is the only acceptable course of action in the current environment. Some  fans were confused as to what part of Ireland the band are from, saying they had lived through the Troubles and so should not have cancelled their show.Refunds will be available from point of purchase from Monday.
