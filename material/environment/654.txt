dam Nicolson says this  paean to the beauty of life on the wing  began when he read a  lecture exploring French philosopher  s aphorism:  Obedience to the force of gravity. The greatest sin.  It says everything about this gorgeous book: a poetic, soaring exploration of 10 species of seabirds: gull, guillemot, gannet and so on   which revels in the way they  float like beings from the otherworld . And for all Nicolson s determination to celebrate the cultural significance of birds that have magnetised his mind, there s a proper dose of gritty reality here too, not just in his horror that  science is coming to understand the seabirds just as they are dying . This is a visceral book, full of hardy, bloodthirsty birds. Nicolson should know this terrain   his father actually , the Hebridean islands teeming with puffin, razorbill and kittiwake   but his writing is expansive, generous and beautifully composed, rather than elitist.
