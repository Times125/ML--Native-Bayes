BEIJING, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities have unveiled a document on Internet regulation in a bid to beef up cyber security, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said Wednesday. The guidelines were issued by the CAC; the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of China; and the Standardization Administration of China (SAC). According to the document, mandatory national standards will be introduced to regulate the fields of major information technology infrastructure protection and classified networks. Authorities will accelerate the introduction of standards in cyber security, personal information protection, cyber security information sharing and other fields. The new standards will be in line with the country's laws and regulations. The document also requires the establishment of an information sharing mechanism for major cyber projects and unified national standards to reduce the burden for companies and to improve the country's overall cyber security, said Gao Lin, secretary general of the SAC. According to an online survey by the Internet Society of China in June, 54 percent of respondents said they believed there was rampant leaking of private information online, with 84 percent said they had personally suffered from information leaks. The economic losses incurred by online fraud and the leaking of private information leakage in China totaled 91.5 billion yuan from the second half of 2015 to the first half of this year.
