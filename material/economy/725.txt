The housing market continues to defy fears of a post-referendum slump after sellers  asking prices hit a new record high of more than ?313,000 on average in April.Across England and Wales, the average price tag on a property being put on the market increased by ?3,547   or 1.1% month-on-month   to reach ?313,655. The figures were released by property website Rightmove, whose records go back to 2002. It said the average asking price in April surpassed a previous high of ?310,471 reached in June 2016. Some economists have forecast static prices this year of 2% at most in response to a squeeze on disposable incomes from rising inflation and slowing wages growth. But others have argued the failure to increase the housing stock will keep prices increasing at nearer 5%.Rightmove said strong numbers of house sales being agreed   at levels not seen since before the credit crunch   have helped to keep pushing asking prices upwards. Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said there were signs of a  strong spring market , which should help to offset any jitters in the market before the general election on 8 June. , Rightmove said, after changes to previously generous tax rules deterred buy-to-let investors from competing for similar homes. Asking prices in this market are up by 6.5% year-on-year, with the typical price tag on a first-time property   one with up to two bedrooms   now at a record high of ?194,881. Across all sectors, asking prices are up by 2.2% year-on-year across England and Wales. Rightmove said the annual pace of asking price growth had generally slowed and was now at its lowest since April 2013. London and the north-east were the only regions in the study where average asking prices were lower than a year ago. In the capital they were downl 1.5% annually, at ?636,777 on average, while in the north-east they were down 0.7%, at an average of ?150,350.Eastern England has seen the strongest growth over the last year, with a 5.3% uplift taking the average property price there to ?349,269. The West Midlands reported the next strongest, with a 5% increase pushing average prices to ?215,784. In Wales, they were up by 4% year-on-year to reach ?186,172 on average. Shipside said the number of sales being agreed was the highest for this time of year since 2007. Last year, the chancellor gave a year s notice of phased reductions . First-time buyers appear to have been the main beneficiary, though a higher rate of stamp duty on second homes, which came into effect this month, also had the effect of spurring sales to people from purchasing an additional property.Shipside said:  Strong buyer activity this month has led to 10% higher numbers of sales agreed than in the same period in 2016. This large year-on-year disparity should be viewed cautiously as the comparable timespan in 2016 saw a drop in buy-to-let activity with the additional second home stamp duty. But he said the figures for agreed sales were also up by 3.8% when compared with two years ago.
