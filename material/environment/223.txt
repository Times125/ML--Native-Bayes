t s late morning and I m driving from Allendale to Hexham along the straight road known as the Paise dyke. Cars bowl along here at speed, but to do that is to miss the far views and the birds. There s always something to catch the eye. Ahead, on this warm March morning, starlings swarm like bees across the fields, a rushing wind as I drive under them, about 3,000 birds. The flock is so regularly spaced that I feel a vast net has been cast over me before they settle on a field pocked by mole hills and rich in worms.There s a farm and a wood called the Paise but the road s name is not on the Ordnance Survey map. In his book published in 1970, Goodwife Hot and Others:Northumberland s Past as Shown in Its Place Names the historian and farmer Geoffrey Watson thought the name referred to land where peas were grown. Though these are upland fields, he believed they would have been adequate for growing this staple diet. The dyke might refer to a stone wall or a causeway over the boggy moorland. Passing along the Paise dyke in winter, I look out for  in the roadside hawthorns. Feasting on the crimson berries, the plump black birds look slightly comical and out of proportion to the tough squat trees. On those cold days, the long trough of the Tyne Valley can be filled with fog but up here it can be clear enough to see the Cheviots or into Scotland.With March showers come days when rainbows arc above isolated Scots pine woodlands and the air vibrates to the wings of . There s the swooping lapwing, a high-up lark or the slow glide of curlew,  coming through the open window of my car. At  Lane I catch a white-barred flash from a wood pigeon, after which this little track is named.In May, there will be snow in summer as  flowers across the bogs. Come August, the honey-scented heather will turn the land purple. Colours and sights shift across the seasons, all seen from this one road.
