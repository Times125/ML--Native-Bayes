Last Updated Aug 2, 2017 11:11 PM EDT President Trump has told members of his New Jersey golf club that he spends so much time away from Washington because the White House is a "real dump." The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the account, which appeared in a lengthy article posted on the website golf.com. The story on Trump's complicated love for golf also appears in Sports Illustrated magazine. The story recounts a scene in which Mr. Trump was chatting with some club members. Mr. Trump told the members he makes such frequent appearances at the property in Bedminster, New Jersey, because: "That White House is a real dump." The president late Wednesday strongly denied he had ever described it that way, tweeting, "I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen. But Fake News said I called it a dump - TOTALLY UNTRUE." I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen.
