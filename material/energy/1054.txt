Energy-plus-house: Living in a small power plant

This apartment building in Frankfurt/Germany is its own power plant. Solar panels on the roof and in the fa ade generate more than enough electricity for its residents. Tenants can track how much power the energy-plus-house is making through smart panels in each unit. They can also use a community fleet of E-cars powered with electricity generated by the house.
