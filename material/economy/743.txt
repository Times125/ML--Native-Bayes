The outgoing chairman of Britain s biggest bank, HSBC, has called for an overhaul of financial crime detection as he sounded the alarm over the impact of  and attempts to fragment global financial regulation.Douglas Flint s warning came as HSBC reported a  (?7.8bn) and announced a $2bn share buy-back   propelling the shares to a four year high.Flint, who has been at  for 22 years and chairman for the last six, used his last statement at the bank to call for the rules designed since the financial crisis to be implemented globally. He also warned on the impact of Brexit on Europe s financial markets.As the bank admitted for the first time that reorganising its business for Brexit will cost up to $300m (?228m), Flint said:  The essential questions that have to be addressed are whether, at the conclusion of the negotiations, the economies of Europe will continue to have access to at least the same amount of financing capacity and related risk management services, and as readily available and similarly priced, as they have enjoyed with the UK as part of the EU. He also warned that divergence in regulation ran the risk of  skewing  financial market activity to where the rules were less onerous, and he called for more cooperation among regulators to root out  bad actors .  What is   clear is that greater cooperation between the public and private sectors, together with a refresh of bank secrecy laws and regulation designed for a different age, would significantly increase the effectiveness of our joint efforts,  Flint said. Among the ideas he endorsed was a mandatory register of beneficial ownership of corporate structures in every country.The City is focused on HSBC s attempts to clean up its business after a series of scandals about the tax avoidance strategies used by its Swiss arm and , which led to a monitor being installed at the bank as part of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA).US lawyer Michael Cherkasky was appointed as the monitor five years ago and his concerns have prompted an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into .Cherkasky s final report is scheduled for next March after which it will be up to the DoJ to decide whether the terms of the DPA have been met.The results were accompanied by pages of legal warnings, including a legal case which began in April 2017 into allegations that HSBC conspired with other banks to manipulate the the US bond market. There are other disclosures covering requests for information relating to the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca and investigations by tax authorities. HSBC also said it was cooperating with the DoJ over the way it packaged up toxic bonds in the run-up to the 20008 financial crisis. The investigation by DoJ, which has already reached settlements with eight other banks, is nearing completion, it added.In the UK, HSBC s results included a $300m hit for the payment protection insurance scandal. HSBC also said it had moved 170,000 accounts to new sort codes to comply with the new ringfencing protocols, known as the Vickers rules, which come into force at the start of 2019. Implementing these rules, which ring-fence high street bank operations from riskier investment banks, has cost ?500m and involved 2,000 staff.Stuart Gulliver, the bank s chief executive, focused on the amount paid out to shareholders in the last year.  In the past 12 months we have paid more in dividends than any other European or American bank and returned $3.5bn to shareholders through share buybacks,  said Gulliver, who in the financial stages of a global plan to make savings of $5bn, cut 25,000 jobs and  pivot  the business towards Asia.HSBC has previously said Brexit could force the bank to move , which Gulliver said would help avoid a loss $1bn of revenue.He reitterated his intention to retire next year while Flint said there was strong list of internal candidates.
