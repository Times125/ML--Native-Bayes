We were saddened, though not surprised, to hear that fewer gardeners are spotting hedgehogs (, 6 February). We have long known hedgehog numbers are in decline. Since the turn of the century numbers have dropped by about a third in urban areas and a half in rural ones. A major factor in their decline is loss and fragmentation of habitat. We have joined forces with People s Trust for Endangered Species on a project called Hedgehog Street, designed to help tackle the habitat crisis. We ask people to create 13cm square gaps in the bottom of their boundary fences and walls to join up usable habitat, and to ask their neighbours, and their neighbours  neighbours, to do the same, until the whole street is accessible to hedgehogs. To date we have had over 42,000 people sign up as  hedgehog champions . There are lots of simple things we can all do to help hedgehogs that could make a big difference.
