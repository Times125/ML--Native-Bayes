The premier of  remains in favour of personal devices to deter sharks instead of culling, nets and drumlines following the death of a 17-year-old girl. on the leg.Her death reignited the long-running shark cull debate in Western Australia, but , the premier, waited until Sunday to personally comment on the issue. What I ve avoided doing this week is politicising this issue ... in light of the fact that a young woman died and her family is grieving,  McGowan told reporters.McGowan said he accepted scientific research indicating there had not been an increase in the white pointer population, despite 15 fatal shark attacks off the WA coast since 2000.The federal environment mminister, , said last week that he was open to a shark cull to protect humans.The premier said the federal government could  take whatever action they want  but he still believed the most sensible policy solution was shark shields and their equivalents, which had been tested and proved to work.He said nets similar to those used in New South Wales and Queensland would not work in Western Australia because the beaches did not have headlands.  I don t think anyone really supports nets and I think you do need the right sort of coastal typography to make them work,  he said. We saw with  that it didn t work. All it did was catch smaller sharks and I m very concerned that a culling program would merely bring bigger sharks in closer to smaller sharks thrashing on hooks. The premier said he spoke to Laeticia s father during the week, describing him as sad but reasonable.  Laeticia s father, Leon, was grief stricken and I had a long talk with him and he s very appreciative of the community support that he s receiving,  he said.A GoFundMe page has so far raised more than $26,500 for Laeticia s family.Paddle-out tributes were organised by surfers in Esperance and her hometown of Singleton later on Sunday.
