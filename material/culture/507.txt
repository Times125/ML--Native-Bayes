It seems as though Noriko Hisada prefers to let her music speak for itself. Other than the year and place of her birth   1963, Tokyo   and a list of her works to date, it is hard to find out much about Hisada or her musical background. We do know, however, if you hadn t guessed it from the title, that Led By the Yellow Bricks   her seven-movement suite for an instrumental sextet of two strings, two woodwind, piano and percussion, which was first performed by the Ensemble f r Neue Musik Zurich last year   was inspired by Frank Baum s children s classic . Hisada s work does not attempt to tell  seven consecutive stories , she insists, nor to portray the events in Baum s book. It is more an attempt to suggest the childhood memories that reading the book evoked, which her music does in gestures of increasing power. Tiny ideas become kernels for much larger ones. The gigantic climaxes she extracts from the ensemble are balanced against textures and solos of much quieter intensity and interrupted a couple of times by a child s voice. It is approachable and a bit mysterious.
