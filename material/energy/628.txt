Households have spent  180m over the past three years on spare power capacity that was never used, according to a report that comes .Power stations have been put on standby over the winter since 2014 as part of the National Grid s supplemental balancing reserve but the  and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) has found that the scheme, which closed in February, was never used.The thinktank said a new scheme to be introduced this winter would see the annual cost jump to  387m.Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the ECIU, said:  The clear message from this report is that paying to boost spare capacity in Britain s electricity system can be very expensive and potentially unnecessary. He calculated that increasing the capacity margin, the percentage difference between electricity supply and demand, would be extremely costly. The margin , prompting . But Marshall found that the cost of building enough capacity for a 10% margin would reach  12.4bn with nuclear power, and even cheaper gas power plants would hit  1.7bn to 2.1bn.The ECIU said that reserves could be more affordably secured through energy storage, greater interconnectivity with Europe and smart technology to help reduce demand from big energy users at crunch times.The  defended the reserve scheme as a cost-effective insurance policy, and added that the winters had been mild.  We believe the supplemental balancing reserve was a prudent and efficient use of money to ensure we had extra power available to us in all eventualities,  a spokeswoman said.The Met Office said the last three winters had seen above average temperatures. But Marshall said the standby scheme was about coping during dark, windless cold snaps, so temperatures across the season were not key.Over the weekend, the National Grid and Google s Deepmind confirmed they were in early talks about how artificial intelligence could be deployed to more efficiently manage power supply and demand. Last year  by using machine learning. The row over how much spare capacity the UK should have to pay for comes ahead of a House of Commons debate about energy bills on Thursday. Four of the big six energy suppliers have announced price rises over the winter including .
