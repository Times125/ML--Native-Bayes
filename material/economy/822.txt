The ONS said unemployment in the quarter ending in June was down 57,000 on the previous three months at 1,484,000. The jobless rate fell to a 42-year low of 4.4%. Employment was up by 125,000 at 32.1 million in the three months to June, the highest rate (75.1%) since modern records began in 1971.Its breakdown of the 338,000 increase in employment over the past year found that full-time jobs were up by 380,000, while part-time posts fell by 43,000.
