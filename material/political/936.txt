The first family marked the July 4th holiday by sending out Independence Day well-wishes on Twitter on Tuesday. President Trump tweeted a video from his campaign-style rally at the Celebrate Freedom Concert at the Kennedy Center last week, as a full band-backed choir from the First Baptist Church in Dallas sang an original song entitled "Make America Great Again" in front of a large American flag backdrop. #HappyIndependenceDay #July4 #USA  pic.twitter.com/NsFslPEFrp The song include the lyrics "Lift the torch of freedom all across the land, step into the future joining hand in hand and make America great again." The song, based off Mr. Trump's campaign slogan during the 2016 election, was written by former First Baptist Church minister of music Gary Moore. The evangelical megachurch and Salem Media Group sponsored the event. First Baptist Pastor Robert Jeffress was a strong backer of Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign. First Lady Melania Trump tweeted a message of thanks to America's service members, saying, "We are the land of the free because of the brave. Thank you to the heroes who serve!" #HappyIndependenceDay   We are the land of the free because of the brave. Thank you to the heroes who serve! Mr. and Mrs. Trump are expected to host a military families picnic at the White House Tuesday evening along with a fireworks viewing as Washington, D.C. hosts its annual fireworks display on the National Mall.
