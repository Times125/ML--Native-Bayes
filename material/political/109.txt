BOSTON -- President Trump lashed out at Sen. Elizabeth Warren over her criticism of his health care bill, calling her a "hopeless case" and "highly overrated voice."  Mr. Trump said during an interview on "Fox & Friends" that aired Sunday that Warren has a lot of "hatred" and "anger" that came out when Warren campaigned for Hillary Clinton, hurting the candidate's chances of winning the election.  "I watched her campaigning for Hillary [Clinton], and she was so angry," Mr. Trump said. "Hillary would be sitting back listening to her trying to smile, but there were a lot of people in that audience that were going 'Wow, is that what we want?' There's a lot of anger there and hostility." Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Mr. Trump has called her "Pocahontas" in the past in reference to questions about Warren's heritage, but in Sunday's interview, he said "that's an insult to Pocahontas."  Warren, a leading liberal and defender of the Affordable Care Act, has opposed efforts to pass a bill to replace the law. The Massachusetts Democrat reiterated her opposition in a statement to The Associated Press on Sunday, saying the health care bill being pushed by Senate Republicans is a "monstrosity" and Trump should "junk it and start over." Warren says the bill will kick "millions off health insurance."
