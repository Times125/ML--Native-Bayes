The Women s Social and Political Union may have started life in Manchester (, 7 September) but the suffragette movement moved to London because, as Christabel Pankhurst said, politicians took more notice of  demonstrations of the feminine bourgeoisie than of the female proletariat . Its committee rooms, once thronged with Lancashire mill hands, were now packed with ladies in silks and satins, not all of them as sensitive to the plight of their less affluent sisterhood as the champion of rational dress, Lady Harberton. Good on Father Alan Everett (, 11 September) for placing poetry at the heart of a devastated community and for also providing real practical help and assistance when the Grenfell Tower victims needed it the most.
