It was disappointing that there was no reference to the strong protective effect of breastfeeding in the prevention of sudden infant death syndrome (Sids) in the commentary on Peter Fleming s important and seminal work on this topic (, 27 August).Where a baby is formula-fed there is an increased risk of Sids. Given this, and when considering the huge additional financial impact of low breastfeeding rates in the UK (if nothing else, the other hot topic of obesity), I cannot understand why the government does not invest a relatively small amount in effectively and consistently supporting breastfeeding.Most women want to breastfeed but are thwarted by the lack of this support, compounded by the powerfully undermining effect of formula milk?advertising. I m surprised that neither Dr Peter Fleming nor the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths, which started in 1971, appears to have noticed that changes in exposure of air pollution correlate with changes in rates of infant mortality.The reduction in air pollution following the switch to cleaner North Sea gas was followed by a rapid fall in the average infant mortality rate in England and Wales, which showed that the widespread belief that high infant mortality is caused by low socioeconomic status must be false.Nine of the 10 councils in England and Wales with the highest infant mortality rates aggregated for the six years from 2009 to 2014 either have an incinerator or are adjacent to a council with an incinerator. The 10th of the above councils adjoins one with a major?cement works. The story of Peter Fleming s painstaking research into the causes of Sids is remarkable. A near eightfold reduction in the occurrences of the syndrome and associated family grief between 1989 and 2016 is extraordinary, both for its magnitude and the simplicity of its cause. Peter Fleming, clearly a modest man, is likely to be embarrassed with the awarding of an honour, but if ever there was justification this is it.
