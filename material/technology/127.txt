Last week, some iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus users reported hearing a crackling sound during phone and FaceTime calls. Early adopters of the new devices complained on Apple's support forums and sites like Reddit of a high-pitched buzzing sound stemming from the phones' built-in earpiece. But on Tuesday, Apple released a software update (iOS 11.0.2) that claims to remedy the problem.
