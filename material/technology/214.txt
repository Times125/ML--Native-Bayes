The company is raising the prices on its standard and premium streaming subscription services. The standard service, which allows customers to stream shows and movies in HD on up to two screens at once, is now priced at $10.99 monthly, up from $9.99. The premium service, which provides viewing on up to four screens (plus ultra HD content access), is $13.99, up from $11.99. The basic service, which enables Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) streaming on one screen and doesn't allow for HD or ultra HD viewing, will remain at $7.99.

According to a Netflix spokesperson, users will be notified of the new prices based on their billing cycle and will get 30 days notice before the changes takes effect. Netflix will begin notifying members of the change on October 19. The price increase for new customers in the U.S. became effective on Thursday.

The increases come as the company pours more money into developing original programming. The company has committed $15.7 billion to streaming content deals -- with $6 billion earmarked for 2017 alone. Last year, Netflix raised its standard HD plan to $9.99 per month, up from $8.99. Netflix has treaded lightly with price increases since 2011, when it suddenly hiked prices 60% for streaming and DVD-by-mail subscribers.
