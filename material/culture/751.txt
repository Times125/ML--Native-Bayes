t takes two-thirds of the film to find out why exactly the apocalypse has broken out in the ethnically diverse Bushwick, one of Brooklyn s gentrifying neighbourhoods.  I m from here,  insists Brittany Snow s Lucy, a blond-haired, blue-eyed, button-nosed civil engineering student who just wants to get to grandma s house. Still, she must (and does) duck and dodge the masked snipers that spray bullets in her direction   like Lara Croft meets Taylor Swift, flanked by burly ex-soldier Stupe (Dave Bautista). Jonathan Milott and Cary Murnion s action thriller inhabits a videogame perspective, keeping Lucy in frame and moving with her as though she s an avatar we re operating. A neat trick, but it gets old fast, much like the constant cacophony of -style gunfire. The film works as a hollow tale of  resistance , with less of a stake in the politics of collective action than in the visceral business of individual survival.
