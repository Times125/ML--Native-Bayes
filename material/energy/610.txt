In his letter () Dr David Lowry raised the issue of radon and shale gas quoting studies in Pennsylvania and sought to reinforce his own views by quoting from a study undertaken by Public Health England in 2014. Let me quote the same study, which states,  caution is required when extrapolating experiences in other countries to the UK since the mode of operation, underlying geology and regulatory environment are likely to be different  and  the PHE position remains, therefore, that the shale gas extraction process poses a low risk to human health if properly run and regulated .Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas present throughout the UK at very low levels. PHE recognised that radon may be released to the environment from shale gas activities, as is the case with existing natural gas supplies, but at concentrations that are not expected to result in significant additional radon exposure. PHE will be undertaking baseline outdoor and household radon monitoring in the Vale of Pickering in North  in areas around Third Energy s KM8 well near Kirby Misperton at three-monthly intervals. The first monitoring  measurements indicated that the radon concentration in the outdoor air around KM8 is close to the UK average . There is no indication of elevated radon concentrations in Pickering, a radon affected area in close proximity of KM8. The analysis for the control site in Oxfordshire showed that the radon concentrations were similar to those for the Vale of Pickering.Study after study undertaken in the UK by renowned universities, professional associations and regulators state that risks to the public s health are low as long as the shale gas industry is properly regulated. As a population we are fortunate to have a world-class system of regulation in this country. Our need for secure energy supplies from the UK is reinforced by our commitment to those standards.
