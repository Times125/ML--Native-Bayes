For anyone who has concerns about our environment and about humanity s future in a rapidly heating world, the  poses a dilemma of some magnitude. On one hand, the four projects   Inch Cape, Neart na Gaoithe and Seagreen Alpha and Bravo   offer the prospect of generating enough electricity to power 1.4m homes without burning fossil fuel or producing carbon emissions. At the same time, between  314m and  1.2bn could be generated for the Scottish economy. Such prospects   claimed by the Scottish government and local industry   are powerful inducements to proceed with the farms  construction.But some environmentalists point to the cost. Every year, the windfarms  335 giant turbines could kill thousands of Scotland s seabirds   puffins, gannets and kittiwakes   when they stray into the giant blades that have been erected in their feeding areas. Hence the RSPB s dismay at last week s decision by Scotland s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, to reverse previous legal bans on the projects. As we report, environmentalists are now locked in opposing camps. One side claims the windfarms will help make  the green energy leader of Europe. Others point out that the country s nesting seabirds make a crucial contribution to Scotland s highly lucrative tourism industry. Their slaughter could have serious financial consequences. More importantly, the nation has a duty of care to its wildlife.The Scottish government therefore faces a delicate balancing act. It has grounds to proceed with the windfarms but must do so in a manner that reflects its obligation to its native animals. It needs to launch renewed and re-energised talks with nature conservation groups such as the RSPB and declare it is committed to reshaping the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay windfarms so they that produce electricity in a way that is less destructive to wildlife and is more environmentally responsible.
