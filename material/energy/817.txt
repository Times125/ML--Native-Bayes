Continued attempts by Australian politicians to link Adani s  to the social uplift of the poor in India are  completely ridiculous , a veteran Indian conservationist says.Debi Goenka, the Mumbai activist who challenged Adani s environmental licence for its mine in the  land court in 2014, said Australian government figures continued to rely on arguments about imported coal lifting Indians out of poverty, which were  all bunkum .The  said he had his  fingers crossed  for Australian conservationists, who on Friday took their challenge to Adani s licence to a Queensland supreme court judicial review.But the Indian coal market, which had swung dramatically against the viability of imported coal for electricity, would seal the Carmichael mine s fate, Goenka said.The conservation group Coast and Country will argue that the environment department, by approving Adani s licence in February, failed in its obligations under the Environmental Protection Act to uphold the  principle of ecologically sustainable development  in place in Queensland since 1994.The Coast and Country spokesman Derec Davies said the prospect of the Queensland government granting Adani  rights to unlimited groundwater extraction  put at risk the 1m-year-old Doongmabulla Springs and the endangered species it supported. It is the  to Adani s long-delayed project, and has left the Indian conglomerate s Australian arm .Coalition government figures and conservationist opponents have mustered moral cases for and against the mine.The federal mining minister, , spoke on Monday on the ABC talk show Q&A of the importance of Adani s mine in the context of the  fossil fuel industry [being] very important to our country and   very important to the development of the world .That followed the prime minister, , invoking coal s role in supporting global development last October.Turnbull said coal was likely to long remain the  largest single part of the global energy mix , which was  a critical ingredient in achieving development goals, alleviating hunger and promoting prosperity, particularly in developing and emerging economies . If Australia stopped exporting coal, the countries to which we export it would simply buy it from somewhere else,  he said.This would arguably increase global emissions  because our coal, by and large, is cleaner than the coal in many other countries. At the time, the energy minister  had said there was a  strong moral case that the green activists sometimes don t comprehend  with coal, when more than 1 billion people lacked access to electricity and more than 2 billion  are using wood and dung for their cooking , a practice the World Health Organisation linked to 4.3 million premature deaths.Speaking to Guardian Australia from Mumbai, Goenka said the circumstances around coal-driven electricity in  meant it would remain out of touch for the  300 million so-called poor Indians who the Australian politicians seem to be really worried about . They are surviving on a per capita income of less than a dollar a day. Most of them don t even have formal housing,  he said.  So the question of them spending 6  per unit of electricity in a place where they don t even have an electrical connection, where they don t even have appliances, I mean it s completely ridiculous. I think if Australian politicians are really worried about the poor in India, maybe they should come and have a first-hand look and see what actually needs to be done to improve the living conditions of the poor, rather than [advocating] for a company that is doing its best to get the politicians to invest Australian money into an Indian company s project. There was in any case  no question of Carmichael coal being imported into India , given the collapse in the financial viability of imported coal, Goenka said.A surge in domestic Indian coal supply meant the Indian government was  actually contemplating banning all coal imports , he said. [But] even without government intervention, the private parties who are out to make money are going to go for the cheapest option,  he said.The Tata Power project at Mundra in the Indian state of Gujarat, next to an Adani Power project,  started blending imported coal with Indian coal on their own because they found it cheaper , Goenka said.The current demand on the Indian electricity network also suggested little need for a dramatic expansion of supply capacity, he said.During times of peak demand on the network over the last two Indian summers, the  average plant load factor for all power plants has been at 65-70% capacity , he said. That means that even during peak load, we have enough power capacity in the country without requiring any more energy or imports from anywhere, or any new power plants. Mainstream power companies had  seen the writing on the wall  and were making billion-dollar investments in renewable energy projects, Goenka said.Adani in India  don t talk about [Carmichael] at all , with the topic only coming up in occasional reports on Australian court cases, and India-Australia diplomatic exchanges, he said. I guess nobody in their right mind wants to talk about making a decision that s going to cost them $15b. That s something that you would want to bury in the deepest coalmine that you can find. Goenka said there was public awareness in India about concern for the Great Barrier Reef around the impact of the Carmichael project, which would be Australia s largest coalmine and a globally significant source of emissions when the coal was burned. People are aware of it and I think a lot of people in India care about climate change and sea-level rises,  he said. The Great Barrier Reef is of worldwide heritage importance and I think a lot of people would be very sorry to see anything happen to it.
