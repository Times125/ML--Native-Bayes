Britain could be facing nationwide festive blackouts next winter unless radical changes are made to the UK s electricity network, a report has said.Electric Shock: Will The Christmas Lights Go Out Next Winter? has been published by the British Infrastructure Group (BIG) of MPs, chaired by Grant Shapps, who was the only MP to back the study.It claims that government targets for closing coal power stations and expanding renewable sources to hit climate change goals have rapidly reduced the UK s generating output.This, it says, has allowed prices to shoot upwards and slashed capacity margins, which are  so tight that National Grid s emergency power deals have become the norm .Shapps said the report focuses on the  dangerously small electricity capacity margins  that have been  left in the wake of a decade of target-led, interventionist energy policy . While nobody questions the noble intentions behind these interventions, it is clear that a perfect coincidence of numerous policies designed to reduce Britain s carbon dioxide emissions has had the unintended effect of hollowing out the reliability of the electricity generating sector,  he added.Findings within the report claim that in recent winters the country s spare electricity margin has fallen from around 17% during the winter of 2011-12 to around 1% this winter.The report says  there is a sustained danger of intermittent blackouts for the foreseeable future , and that this is down to  dwindling base capacity and freak weather events .In order to plug the capacity gap, household bills by 2020 could increase by as much as  30 a year   nearly double government estimates.The report also states that the  has been given the go-ahead by the government to pursue emergency measures to cover peak demand and prevent blackouts.Measures to stop the country s lights going out during peak periods include restarting old , according to the report.Power-intensive businesses such as factories are also paid to  detach  from the grid and run from their own energy sources such as emergency diesel generators.The procurement of contracts with power stations not trading in the normal energy market, who are paid an  exorbitant sum  to be kept in standby mode over winter, is also a measure.Last winter National Grid paid  33.9m for this emergency power, with  122.4m set to be spent during the cold months of 2016-2017.The BIG report says these costs are  spread across the network and picked up by consumers in the form of higher bills . Consumers, both domestic and business, having once reaped the benefits of tumbling prices after the 1990s market reforms, are now resigned to paying ever-higher electricity bills,  the report adds.Shapps said:  A radical rehabilitation of electricity markets is required to bring both consumer prices and capacity concerns under control in the short term. In the longer term he said the government should  work to make it profitable for private companies to invest and innovate in our electricity markets once again .The report states that if Britain is to  make the shift to the cleaner, electrically powered economy of the future, its electricity generating sector must be able to provide cheap electricity in abundance, respond rapidly to new demands and shoulder its own risks and rewards .Daniel Mahoney, head of economic research at the Centre for Policy Studies, said:  Mismanagement of energy policy   both from the European Union and the UK government   has left the UK with desperately narrow capacity margins. In her first major campaign speech, Theresa May made a welcome declaration that she wanted to see an energy policy that promotes the reliability of supply and lower costs for users. This report re-emphasises the need for this commitment to be delivered.
