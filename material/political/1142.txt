WASHINGTON -- There are two new residents at the United States Naval Observatory Monday, where the vice president's residence is, and both of them have four legs. Harley, a new puppy, and Hazel, a new kitten, both flew on Air Force Two with the Pence family to Washington on Sunday. The family was returning from a weekend in Indianapolis. Both Harley and Hazel hail from Indiana. Second lady Karen Pence and the Pence children surprised the vice president on Father's Day with Harley, an Australian Shepherd. Harley was born on St. Patrick's Day earlier this year. Mrs. Pence obtained Hazel for herself. Hazel is a gray kitten, born on April Fool's Day.   Mrs. Pence announced the family's new pets on Twitter Sunday.
