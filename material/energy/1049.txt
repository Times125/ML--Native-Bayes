, the billionaire co-founder of electric car giant Tesla, has thrown down a challenge to the South Australian and federal governments, saying he can solve the state s energy woes within 100 days   or he ll deliver the 100MW battery storage system for free.On Thursday, Lyndon Rive, Tesla s vice-president for energy products, the company could install the 100-300 megawatt hours of battery storage that would be required to prevent the power shortages that have been . Thanks to stepped-up production out of Tesla s new Gigafactory in Nevada, he said it could be achieved within 100 days.Mike Cannon-Brookes, the Australian co-founder of Silicon Valley startup Atlassian, on Friday tweeted Elon Musk, asking if  was serious about being able to install the capacity.

Rive, Musk s cousin who co-founded with him the solar energy outfit SolarCity, had said Tesla s battery technology could address the power shortfall from the Hazelwood power plant closure in Victoria, as well as SA s blackouts.

The most recent blackout  the Australian Energy Market Operator said there were many factors behind it, including higher demand than anticipated.Grid scale battery storage could help to even out price spikes, prevent blackouts and improve reliability across the network.The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) recently approved a $450,000 grant to EnergyAustralia  in the Spencer Gulf. That project has a capacity to produce about 100MW with six to eight hours of storage.In comparison, Tumut 3 hydroelectric station, Australia s largest pumped hydro storage, has a capacity of 1,500 megawatts.
