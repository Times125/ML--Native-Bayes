Trump s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt wants to hold televised  Red Team/Blue Team  climate science  debates.  The idea is that a  Red Team  of scientists will challenge the mainstream findings of  Blue Team  scientists. That may sound familiar, because it s exactly how the peer-review process works. But climate deniers have lost the debate in the peer-reviewed literature, with , and the few  and . So Scott Pruitt is trying to put his thumb on the scale, giving the less than 3% of contrarian scientists equal footing on a  Red Team.  John Oliver showed how to do a statistically representative televised climate debate (so brilliantly that it s been viewed 7.4m times), but it s probably not what Pruitt had in mind:Climate  Red Teams  are a concept that the fossil fuel-funded Heritage Foundation tried four years ago, calling its 2013  NIPCC report  part of  But much like climate contrarian research papers, the .The name also evokes images of the red and blue pills in The Matrix, in which characters could choose to remain in the Matrix (denial) by taking the blue pill, or accept reality with the red pill. In this case the colors are reversed, but the concept is the same   by choosing the red team, Pruitt and company are choosing the soothing comfort of denial over the harsh reality of human-caused climate change and the threats it poses.Fortunately, it seems like a growing number of Republican leaders are choosing the red pill.In April, Trump s energy secretary Rick Perry  to determine whether policies promoting renewable energy growth are undermining its stability by crowding out  baseload  power from sources that are always readily available (ie don t rely on intermittent wind or sunlight). Perry s memo specifically called out  regulatory burdens introduced by previous administrations that were designed to decrease coal-fired power generation.  He put , who previously worked for the  Institute for Energy Research, where he published a report calling renewable energy policies  the single greatest emerging threat  to the US power grid.In short, it appeared as though the Trump administration was putting together a biased report to support its pro-coal agenda. But a  was , and it didn t follow the administration playbook. The report was drafted by career staffers at the Department of Energy, who are experts in the field and apparently didn t bow to any potential administration pressure for pro-fossil fuel conclusions. The draft is now under review by administration officials and may change as a result, but the leaked draft ensures that the public sees the experts  conclusions.The report concluded that many recent baseload plant retirements  are consistent with observed market forces,  often being taken out of commission due to  low natural gas price-based electricity prices, low electric demand, environmental regulations, state policies, and competition from renewables . Most of the coal and natural gas baseload plants that have retired are old, inefficient units that were no longer cost-effective. Increased energy efficiency has also curbed American electricity demand. The report concluded that environmental regulations and renewable energy subsidies  played minor roles  in accelerating baseload plant retirements compared to those other factors.Most importantly, the draft report concluded that the electric grid remains reliable:These conclusions are consistent with    including in red states where wind supplies a significant fraction of electricity (including Perry s home state of Texas)   that . They re also consistent with  published in 2012, which concluded:It s unclear why Perry thought his 60-day study would overturn the findings of that two-year report, or . Even some Republicans from states that benefit from cheap wind energy were critical of the report. For example, :In another positive sign that Republican climate denial is cracking, an amendment to cut Department of Defense (DoD) funding for a study on how climate change will impact national security over the next 20 years was  ( 22 of the 24 Republican members of the ) voting against the amendment.The  posed by climate change. Normally the GOP views itself as the more pro-military party, but on climate change they ve resisted the DoD s findings. While three-quarters of House Republicans voted in favor of the amendment, a significant fraction bucked the climate denial establishment, in this case opting to take the red pill. It may seem like a minor event, but any cracks in the wall of GOP climate denial represent important progress. Perhaps the party needs its own version of  to accelerate the process.
