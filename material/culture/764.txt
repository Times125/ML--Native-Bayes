t s a self-assured author who decides to write a children s novel about the adventures of a  young boy wizard  in a world of magic, but then  has reasons to be confident: 8m copies sold of her books, a  and a spin-off series for TV.As with the Viking world of , the eagerly awaited   is set in the ancient past and our two heroes are scrappy kids struggling with that timeless issue of failing to live up to parental expectations. In place of dragons, there are sprites, deep-thinking giants, ogres and snow cats living in an enchanted wildwood.The kingdom of Wizards is at war with the neighbouring queendom of iron Warriors, against whose iron weapons their magic is useless. When the boy wizard, Xar (a troublemaking prince waiting in vain for his magic to  come in ), meets the warrior princess, Wish, they discover that the evil magic of witches   long thought extinct   has returned.The detail of Cowell s imagined world is a delight, not least in her scratchy pencil illustrations that evoke the darting, insect-like sprites or the pitch-black terrors of the forest. And her kinetic prose barely pauses for breath as Xar and Wish leap from one action-packed scrape to the next (you can practically see the scenes from the already-signed Dreamworks film jumping off the pages).In an introduction to her new series, Cowell (an advocate for kids literacy) extols the joys of being read to as a child and there are many pleasures here for parents, including  echoes (iron invaders, infectious  bad  magic) and a moment where Crusher the giant ponders the paradoxes of an expanding universe ( giants are big and they tend to have BIG thoughts ). This one will run and run. by Cressida Cowell is published by Hodder (?12.99). To order a copy for ?11.04 go to  or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p&p over ?10, online orders only.
