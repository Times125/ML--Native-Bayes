Swift, smart and typically self-assured,  to Donald Trump s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords confirmed a near-faultless debut on the international stage for France s new president, analysts said.  Make our planet great again,  Macron, a diplomatic novice not yet 40, exhorted the world, recycling Trump s own slogan in an unprecedented address partly in English from the Elys e Palace soon after the US president had informed the world he was withdrawing from the global agreement on Thursday. The phrase, tweeted minutes later as a , was accompanied by a renewed invitation to US scientists, researchers and entrepreneurs disappointed by their administration s move to  come to France and work with us together  on climate solutions. It was adroitly done,  said Thomas Gomart, the director of the French Institute for International Relations.  It showed a self-confidence, even a form of insolence   In terms of foreign relations, the early stages of Macron s presidency have undeniably been a success.  Macron s brisk three-minute intervention on Thursday night won him  both abroad   where he was compared favourably to Trump   and at home, where it was widely and only half-jokingly suggested he should change his title to  leader of the free world . From his  before last week s Nato meeting in Brussels to his  extremely frank and direct  exchange with Russia s , the French president, less than a month into his mandate, has shown  boldness   agility and timing , said the .Strategically, in a world of Trump and Putin, with ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and the EU weakened by Brexit,  to restore and amplify France s global voice at the heart of a stronger Europe based on a revival of the critical postwar relationship between Paris and Berlin.Alive to the importance of symbols and images, his style is at times purposely theatrical. Macron is determined to  rehabilitate the role of the president , Gomart said, after what many saw as the vulgarity of Nicolas Sarkozy and the exaggerated normality of Fran?ois Hollande. So what we see is a convergence between this young president who is the incarnation of a form of modernity, and these symbols that resonate with the French, these references to France s history,  Gomart said.  Don t forget parliamentary elections are not far away. French and international media had a field day with the , in which the 39-year-old French leader squeezed his much older US counterpart s hand so hard that Trump s knuckles whitened and he was eventually forced to relinquish his grip.Macron later admitted the move had  not been innocent  and was  a moment of truth , describing Trump, Putin and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo?an, as men who see relationships  in terms of a balance of power  and to whom it was vital  not to grant even small concessions .Much was also made of his public admonishment of Putin on Monday. With the Russian president at his side in the gilded splendour of the Palace of Versailles, Macron warned France would show  no weakness  if chemical weapons were used in Syria, would be  constantly vigilant  on , and expected the  on Ukraine to be implemented.He also said firmly that Russia Today and Sputnik, two Kremlin-funded news outlets, had behaved  like agents of influence and propaganda  that had repeatedly  spread serious untruths  about him during his election campaign.Polls suggest the approach is proving effective with French voters. Macron s new political movement, La R publique En Marche, is on target for a 30% share of the national vote in next month s elections   a 10-point advance since his arrival in the Elys e last month.An Ipsos poll this week suggested the cross-party movement could win between 395 and 425 seats in the lower house of parliament, comfortably above the 289 it would need to secure an absolute majority in 577-seat national assembly.But there were suggestions on Friday that Macron s style may have backfired in one respect: the  that alongside intense EU pressure on Trump over the climate accord, agreed in the French capital in 2015, the younger leader s tough stance could just have confirmed Trump in his intentions.Macron s words  irritated and bewildered  the US president, the paper quoted unnamed White House aides as saying, and may have helped inspire his comment on Thursday that he  was elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh   not Paris .
