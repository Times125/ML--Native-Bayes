Last week our dictation technology, which is used to document all patient visits and interaction, Nuance, as well as with other technology companies, experienced a worldwide cyberattack. In an effort to protect patient information, Nuance shut its operations down. We are extremely thankful our patient information continues to remain secure. However, this has a profound impact on the team members who are seeing patients. Mercy Medical Center   North Iowa initiated a crisis team to brainstorm plans and containments for those clinicians for the time the dictation technology is inaccessible. Unfortunately, these types of situations are occurring more frequently across the nation and around the world. Earlier this month, Waverly Hospital's computers were hacked by ransomware. The American Hospital Association (AHA) has been distributing updates on new and evolving cyberattacks that use a variety of Ransomware. This ransomware has hit businesses in Ukraine, India, France, Russia and Spain. The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has informed us some United States hospitals and a pharmaceutical company also have been attacked. At this time, there is no definitive assessment about the source of the cyberattack. At MCRHC, we have not experienced a breach of information; however, we continue to be vigilant and follow proper cyber practices in order to maintain our patients' privacy. This involves ensuring system technology patches and anti-virus definitions are up to date. This vigilance is very important for us to continue to be the "Trusted Healthcare Partner for Life!"
