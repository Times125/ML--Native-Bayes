he malfunctioning studio system has foisted many subprime ideas upon us recently, but this opportunistic, -age hybrid of war-on-terror drama and YA fantasy numbers among the junkiest. Ex- Dylan O Brien plays Mitch Rapp, an emotionally volatile sort picked up by the CIA after pursuing the sleeper cell who gunned down his holidaying fiancee in one early breach of basic cinematic decency. Thereafter he s assigned Aviator-sporting ex-Navy Seal mentor Stan Hurley (, bent once more towards career self-sabotage), passed through whizzy VR training exercises and dispatched to Europe alongside a babelicious colleague to recover a stray nuke while generally kicking ass for the US of A. As Hurley growls it:  Some bad people plan on doing some bad things, and it s our job to stop  em. Director Michael Cuesta, formerly known for filigreed indies (LIE, ), has perhaps concluded there s more money in becoming a backup , but his chosen moves here are blunt from overuse.

O Brien demonstrates admirable deltoids and an ability to grow stubble as the character arc requires, but the attempt to rebrand counterterrorism manoeuvres as a heady extension of  falls somewhere between dimwitted and deeply cynical. Recruitment numbers can t be this low, surely.
