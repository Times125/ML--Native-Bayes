Wan Gang, China's minister of science and technology, gives a press conference for the third session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing, capital of China, March 11, 2015. (Xinhua/Li Xin) BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese science official said Wednesday that security checks, as required by a draft anti-terror law, follows "international convention." The draft stipulates anti-terror measures which require technology firms to provide encryption keys and grant law enforcement agencies access for counterterrorism reasons. Security measures for information products in China were "in line with international common practices" and the Chinese law, political advisor Wan Gang who is minister of science and technology said at a press conference on the sidelines of the ongoing national legislative session. The United States and Europe have made similar requests on information security for Chinese companies operating overseas, Wan said. However, the stipulation on Internet and information security has drawn global concern. Observers say the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency both have access to the equipment of major U.S. technology firms. Chinese authorities have said the surveillance of terrorism actions on equipment of the Internet and telecommunication companies in China will be carried out strictly in accordance with the law. The anti-terrorism draft will be put for a third reading and a vote "in due time," according to the top legislature's plan.
