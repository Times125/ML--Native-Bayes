The government has admitted that payments of up to ?10,000 a household for living near a fracking well would not be distributed until a new site begins operating and producing gas šC at least five years after exploration begins.In , officials said that payments would be capped at ?10m for each community living near a well, over its lifetime. They also conceded that any money flowing directly to households would not happen until a full-scale fracking industry is up and running.At the weekend,  a modification of George Osborne¡¯s plans to use part of the tax take from fracking to distribute to communities affected, a move that has been dismissed by environmentalists as a bribe to dampen community opposition to the technology.May¡¯s changes would mean that private households could benefit financially as well as local authorities. She said: ¡°As I said on my first night as prime minister: when we take the big calls, we¡¯ll think not of the powerful but of you. This announcement is an example of putting those principles into action. It¡¯s about making sure people personally benefit from economic decisions that are taken šC not just councils šC and putting them back in control over their lives.¡±According to the consultation document, the payments ¡°will be funded from tax revenues from sites developed for gas production and so it is likely to come later than the first community benefits funding provided by the industry, which will begin when the first exploration wells are drilled to test the flow of gas¡±. . The former chairman of Cuadrilla, one of Britain¡¯s leading shale companies,  that it would take at least five years of exploration šC drilling and testing gas flows šC before production at scale. That suggests any such payments are unlikely to be paid to individuals before the early 2020s. Currently, only , at the village of Kirby Misperton in North Yorkshire. ¡°Exploratory activity is still at an early stage in the UK,¡± the consultation admits.The shale wealth fund plan will be funded by 10% of tax revenues from shale gas production. The amount each well is expected to provide in tax revenue will vary from place to place, meaning some households will get less than others.¡°Tax revenues are driven by profitability; the profitability of any site is dependent on fuel prices, operator costs and site-specific geology,¡± the government says.The consultation also says that the government does not yet know how to define a catchment area around a shale development for compensation, or which body should have the authority locally to help dispense the money from the wealth fund.On Sunday, Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy and climate change secretary,  when there was no such incentive for people to accept clean-energy windfarms.¡°Does Theresa May really hold the British public in such high esteem that she thinks they can be bribed into fracking and a fossil fuel future?¡± he said. ¡°Appealing to people¡¯s higher nature,  gives a ?10,000-plus bribe if you live near a frack site. If you live near a windfarm, nothing ¡­ The asymmetry is amazing. Windfarms are subject to a localism veto but for shale gas, [the] government can override.¡±
