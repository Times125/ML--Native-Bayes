utstanding central performances from  and Ben Mendelsohn can t quite ease the tricky transition from stage to screen of this uncomfortable drama by David Harrower. It explores a young woman s complex and, frankly, very unsettling response to the abuse she suffered as a child at the hands of the neighbour who claimed he loved her. Mara plays Una with an unblinking intensity that makes you want to flinch away from the screen; Mendelsohn is slippery and charming as Ray, the man who ruined her life. Flashbacks are elegantly threaded through the highly charged reunion between Una and her abuser. It s an encounter that is captured with hard, cold photography and divisive framing. Pacing issues are the main problem here   the airless tension dissipates as soon as Una is left alone.
