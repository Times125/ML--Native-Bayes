 m as lucky as the moon, on a starry night in June,  sings Sundf?r on her album s acoustic opener. It s a misleadingly cutesy start. After 2015 s disco-infused prog record , the Norwegian songwriter and producer is having her  moment. Inspired by travels around varied political and social landscapes, from North Korea to the Amazon rainforest, there are trickling water sounds, wiry bleeps and animal peeps throughout. Sundf?r is startlingly back-to-basics at times   there are even schmaltzy ballad tones   but frequently her straightforward songs derail brilliantly.The sombre Good Luck Bad Luck is like an Adele song, if Adele sung about oil spills to the sound of smoky, late-night jazz. Music for People in Trouble is an art installation-like interlude, while folk song The Sound of War declares that  chaos remains  and ends with a moody, cinematic soundscape. Another triumph for Sundf?r, who delivers complex, maudlin subjects with lightness and majesty.
