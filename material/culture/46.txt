 is known for its iconic landmarks, but Roc Isern turns his camera to buildings others may tend to look past.Isern is a technical architect and photographer based in the Catalan capital. Since 2014, he has been capturing the facades of Barcelona s buildings for tens of thousands of followers on Instagram at .Cropped to exclude context, the minimalist imagery presents the different textures and patterns of the city s architecture. I m interested in geometrical shapes, patterns, colours and shadows, and obsessed with symmetries and perspective,  he says.He believes Barcelona s different districts offer a varied urban style and an  inexhaustible source of possibilities , allowing him to discover new areas through photography.Isern is a self-taught photographer and says there has been a learning curve in creating a visual style.  I ve always loved the straight facade shots, but when I started on  I wasn t sufficiently dominating the technique to take and edit good photos. The trick lies in taking the photo as perpendicular as possible to the building s facade, and making sure the frame is free of obstacles such as cables, trees and street lights. The most visible and accessible part of the architecture are the facades, and if they are shown through photography with sensitivity and good taste, they offer a great reward,  he says.A selection of our favourite images are below.
