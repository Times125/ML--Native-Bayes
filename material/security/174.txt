LONDON, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government on Friday announced a series of new measures to help its businesses face the "cyber security challenge" and support its cyber security firms to tap into the U.S. market. The new measures were announced when British Prime Minister David Cameron was on a two-day state visit to the United States for talks with U.S. President Barack Obama. Downing Street said "cyber security is high on the agenda as the government steps up its efforts to combat cyber threats against the industry." A group of 12 British cyber security firms were also traveling to Washington to meet a host of U.S. businesses, in a bid to win more British business for the growing sector. As part of the new measures, Britain appointed a new cyber security envoy, Andy Williams, to help British small businesses and first-time exporters promote their business interests across the United States. Williams, a British industry expert, will be based in the British Embassy in Washington and help boost British-U.S. cyber security deals, Downing Street said in a statement. Other government support for cyber security firms included an updated "Ten Steps to Cyber Security" guide instructing businesses to combat cyber threats, improved cyber security information and advice for businesses, and funding for early stage cyber security start-up firms. "We're stepping up the practical support we offer UK cyber security companies to make sure they have the best opportunity to win even more business in the U.S.," Cameron said. Britain's cyber security sector is worth over 6 billion pounds (about 9.1 U.S. dollars) and employs 40,000 people, according to British Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.
