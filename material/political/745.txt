Sen. Rand Paul will meet with President Trump Tuesday afternoon as Senate Republican leaders struggle to convince their own members to back their health care bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. The Kentucky Republican will meet with Mr. Trump at the White House around noon, CBS News confirmed. Paul is among six Senate Republicans who have come out against the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA). Republicans can only afford two defections to pass the measure, assuming all Democrats oppose it. Hours after bill text was released last Thursday, Paul released a joint statement with Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Ted Cruz, R-Texas and Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin arguing that the legislation doesn't go far enough in delivering an Obamacare repeal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has been aiming for a vote this week before lawmakers leave for their week-long July 4 recess, but that could potentially change if leaders fail to secure enough support to advance the bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its cost estimate of the bill Monday, which projects that 22 million more people will be without health insurance than Obamacare over the next 10 years. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, came out against the bill following the CBO's report.
