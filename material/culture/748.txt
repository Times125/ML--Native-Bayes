t runs for exactly an hour, but there s so much variety here, packed into what is essentially a piano trio album, that it seems over in half the time. There are jazz pieces by Monk, Miles Davis and others, an improvisation on a prelude by Chopin, a Stylistics soul classic, an original or two, and so on. And they all flow together quite naturally under the mellow influence of  s piano. Vibraphonist Steve Nelson joins in brilliantly on three numbers, with Chestnut quite content to play the unobtrusive accompanist when necessary, and the whole show closes with a gospel anthem, played as a rapturous piano solo.
