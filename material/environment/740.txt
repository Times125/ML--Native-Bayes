Villagers are living in fear, especially the Paharia tribe that lives on the upper hillier regions where the elephant roams. Something must be done,  Singh said, referring to one of the poorest indigenous tribal communities in eastern India. We have a team of experts and hunters here with us. We are brainstorming a solution ... one of them is to shoot the animal. But that s the last resort and we will take a call in a day or two. It is likely the marauding elephant wandered from its herd and became lost, straying into villages where the killings took place.Elephants kill about 60 people every year in forested Jharkhand, Singh said, a fraction of the  in the three years to May.The environment ministry estimates a person dies every day in India in clashes with these endangered, jungle-dwelling animals   the vast majority crushed by elephants.Violent encounters between elephants and humans were an increasing trend, said Singh, as vast swaths of forest are cleared for human settlements or industry.
