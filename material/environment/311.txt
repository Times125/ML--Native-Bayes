Patrick Barkham s remarks on garden decking and wildlife loss (, 7 March) chime with research we undertook on the changes to garden vegetation in London over an eight-year period. We found that between 1998-99 and 2006-07, 3,000 hectares of vegetation disappeared from gardens, replaced by hard standing and decking. This loss, equivalent to 2.5 Hyde Parks each year, was compounded by the loss of 1m trees from gardens.? This period of change coincided with Ground Force s time on television.?Whether or not decking is now the culprit in gardens it once was, there s evidence that artificial lawns   largely made from fossil fuels   are becoming the  new black , again to the detriment of wildlife and the city s ability to adapt to climate change.
