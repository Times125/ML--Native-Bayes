MOSCOW, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Friday that it had received information about attempts of foreign intelligence services to launch large-scale cyber attacks against the country's financial system from Monday. "The cyber attack is expected to be accompanied by a mass of provocative SMS messages and publications in social networks, alleging a crisis of Russia's credit and financial system, bankruptcies and revocation of licenses of a number of federal and regional banks," the FSB said. It claimed the attacks were planned from servers located in the Netherlands and belonging to Ukrainian BlazingFast hosting company. The FSB said it is taking measures to neutralize the threats to the economic and information security of Russia. The Russian Central Bank has given recommendations for banks to prevent possible attacks. Neither the Netherlands nor Ukraine have yet made any response to the claim.
