THE Ukrainian software firm used as part of last week s global cyber attack warned yesterday that all computers sharing a network with its infected accounting software had been compromised. Hackers used a virus to take down thousands of computers in dozens of countries, disrupting shipping and businesses. A video released by Ukrainian police showed masked men armed with assault rifles raiding the offices of software developer Intellect Service on Tuesday, after cyber security researchers said they had found a  back door  written into some of the updates issued by its M.E. Doc accounting software. M.E. Doc is used by 80 percent of Ukrainian companies and installed on around 1 million computers in the country. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said police had blocked a second cyber attack from servers hosting the software. Intellect Service previously denied its servers had been compromised, but when asked yesterday whether a back door had been inserted, Chief Executive Olesya Bilousova said:  Yes there was. And the fact is that this back door needs to be closed.  Any computer on the same network as machines using M.E. Doc was now vulnerable to another attack, she said. Cyber security experts said that while hackers have previously been known to insert viruses into software updates   thus tricking computers and system administrators into installing the malware on their own systems   the attack on Ukraine is the largest and most disruptive such assault to date.
