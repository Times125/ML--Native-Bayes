ccording to Peter Wohlleben, we fail to understand trees because  they live on a different time scale  from us. One of the world s most venerable trees is a? that is 9,500 years old. Wohlleben draws on decades of experience as a forester in Germany s Eifel mountains for this eye-opening book. He starts with wise words for those entering a forest:  Slow down, breathe deep and look around.  Not only is the air cleaner under trees, as their leaves filter out harmful pollutants, but pine forests release defensive compounds that kill germs:  Trees disinfect their surroundings.  Trees also release oxygen, so a walk in the woods is  like taking a shower in oxygen . Wohlleben s aim is to let us see the trees and forests around us not just as  lumber factories  but as wondrous organisms, as complex as any animal. Trees are, for instance,  social beings , communicating with each other through their roots, thanks to the fungal   that permeates the forest soil, even  in hard times. Wohlleben s book will change your view of the wooded world.  is published by Harper Collins. To order a copy for ?8.49 (RRP ?9.99) go to  or call 0330 333 6846.
