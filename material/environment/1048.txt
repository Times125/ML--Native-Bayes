We welcome your excellent coverage of President Trump s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement (). However, there are references to the US joining Syria and Nicaragua in rejecting the agreement. Presented out of context, this comparison is flawed. Syria didn t sign because of the catastrophic civil war. Nicaragua refused to sign because it believes the agreement is too weak to address the enormity of the consequences of climate change, particularly in vulnerable developing countries.Paul Oquist, Nicaraguan representative to the Paris talks, pointed out that the Paris carbon reduction targets are non-binding and even if fully met would lead to a catastrophic three-degree temperature rise. Oquist also highlighted the lack of political will and ambition on the part of the largest polluters, their failure to accept historical responsibility for global warming, and the lack of financial resources for technological transfer, adaptation, and compensation for losses and damages. He went on to say:  The Paris Agreement will not solve global warming problems but merely postpone them. Meanwhile, Nicaragua, a country responsible for only 0.3% of global emissions, has a renewable energy target of 90% by 2020. This programme has been praised by the Inter-America Development Bank as  a model for the world on the shift to green energy . It is misleading to report, out of context, that the US joins Syria and  on climate change: on this and an increasingly long list of other issues the US stands alone. I am a 73-year-old American citizen, a progressive independent unaffiliated with any major US political party. I read about the controversy regarding Donald Trump s state visit to the UK this fall. Like so many Americans, I am incredibly embarrassed and concerned by Mr Trump s behaviour at home and on the world stage. Not only his boorishness at the G7 but his reluctance to reaffirm article 5 and the withdrawal from the Paris climate accord have many Americans like me anguished. His governance-by-tweet is egomaniacal and dangerous. These actions lead one to suspect a personality disorder. I therefore write to urge the UK to reconsider this invitation. To reward his policies and behaviour with a state visit is akin to enabling it.
