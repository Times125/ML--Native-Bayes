Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he's "not going anywhere" on Wednesday amid reports that he was considering stepping down by the end of the year. With a smile, Tillerson said he will stay "as long as the president lets me" when a CBS News reporter asked at the State Department how long he plans to stick around for. He described his current relationship with President Trump in one word: "good." Tillerson has been taking "a little time off" the last few days, explained State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert on Tuesday. "He does have the ability to go away for a few days on his own," she said. Tillerson spent the time in Texas with his family in what the State Department said was planned time off. Yet his absence further exacerbated rumors of his possible departure. Tillerson's growing frustrations with certain elements of his job   such as the slow hiring process at the department   have bubbled to the surface in recent weeks. And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump disagreed with Tillerson over the State Department's recent decision to recertify that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal.  "I have a lot of respect for Rex and his people, good relationship. It's easier to say they comply. It's a lot easier. But it's the wrong thing. They don't comply," Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He added that he would be "surprised" if Iran was in compliance when it comes time for the next 90-day review of the treaty.  Still, Tillerson and his staff say that he is not leaving. On Wednesday, Tillerson was even sure to give reporters a rare summary of his day, demonstrating that he is hard at work. "I had a very good working breakfast this morning with Speaker Ryan," Tillerson said. "We covered a number of important topics, had a lengthy meeting with the Vice President at the White House on some important policy issues today."
