Rep. Steve Scalise has been discharged from the hospital where he was recuperating from a gunshot wound. Scalise, who was shot and gravely wounded during a GOP congressional baseball practice days before an annual charity baseball game, will still undergo further rehabilitation, according to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where he has been recovering for the past several weeks.  According to MedStar, Scalise has "made excellent progress in his recovery" and "is in good spirits and is looking forward to his return to work once he completes rehabilitation." After he was shot in the hip during the baseball practice, Scalise arrived at the hospital in critical condition. Two members of the U.S. Capital Police, a GOP staffer and a lobbyist were also injured in the shooting in June.  Audio of the shooting was used in a campaign ad this week, for Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, who is running against Sen. Luther Strange in the Alabama special election in mid-August. Strange was appointed to fill the vacancy left when Jeff Sessions was named attorney general.
