tory strands intertwine like vines in this engaging family drama about three siblings who inherit their familyïŒs winery in Burgundy. Jean (Pio Marma?) returns from Australia, leaving his wife, son and vineyard to visit the dying father whose influence he fled 10 years earlier. His sister, Juliette (Ana Girardot), now runs the wine business but as a woman she struggles to be taken seriously; the youngest brother, Jè°·rè°·mie (Fran?ois Civil), is browbeaten by an overbearing father-in-law. Wine flows through the veins of all three; the episodic storytelling has something of the rambling, well-lubricated quality of a bar-room anecdote. Very watchable, but perhaps lacking in real drama, this is an easy-drinking vintage of a movie that wonïŒt challenge the palate of the audience.
