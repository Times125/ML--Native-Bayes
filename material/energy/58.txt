Brexit should be a perfect opportunity to demonstrate conclusively a better way for nuclear in west Cumbria. For 70 years Whitehaven has been a hub for nuclear. That is why we are calling on the British government to commit the investment that is lost by Toshiba pulling out and for the British and Japanese governments to work together on a broader solution so that post-Brexit, west Cumbria jobs, skills and nuclear futures are guaranteed.  Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said:  The government s energy policy is in chaos. We have become increasingly reliant on the decisions of foreign companies whose interests lie with their owners and not British consumers.  If Toshiba pulls out of the proposed Moorside plant in Cumbria, the government must intervene immediately and provide public support and financial stability for Moorside and the community of west Cumbria. That means taking a public stake in exchange for public support to protect energy supplies and jobs.
