atching politics builds a high tolerance for hypocrisy and humbug, but even I am aghast at the Coalition s antics this week   fondling a lump of coal in parliament while accusing the opposition of an  ideological approach to energy  and negligence in policy planning.Seriously. There s a long list of blame and shame for Australia s threadbare climate and energy policy, and the failure to plan for an energy market crisis that experts have warned about for years. But Malcolm Turnbull s  takes out first place.Arguably all sides of politics have made mistakes or miscalculations to get us to this point of omni-failure   high prices, blackouts and an inability to reduce electricity sector emissions   and yes, ideology has played a part: mostly the climate-change denying, renewables-are-a-socialist-plot ideology espoused by sections of the Liberal and National parties that once upon a time, a long time ago, Turnbull also railed against. Before we untether from reality entirely and drift off into a Trump-like universe where truth belongs to whoever delivers the best poll-driven lines , let s hammer down a few facts. Because we aren t reviewing bad theatre here and when some commentators opine about whether Turnbull s lines will  work , or how funny the whole thing was, what they are really assessing is whether the prime minister can successfully, and in broad daylight, shift the blame for a monumental stuff-up, while apparently proposing solutions that will make it substantially worse in every regard. Since it s our job to point out things like that, here are a few facts that undermine the  coal comeback  PR strategy that started rolling out sometime last year:We ve been enduring this climate war nonsense for more than a decade and now we re wearing the consequences   rising prices, unreliable power supply and increasing emissions. Responding with a parliamentary pantomime to try to shift the blame to a fictitious renewable industry bad guy is true ideological idiocy and also negligent, because it puts the shallowest, shortest-term and most opportunistic strategy for political survival ahead of households, investors and future generations.
