LONDON -- J.K. Rowling has apologized for tweets alleging that U.S. President Donald Trump refused to shake the hand of a disabled boy. The "Harry Potter" author called Mr. Trump "horrible" after seeing footage of the president appearing to ignore the child's outstretched hand during a White House event last week. But the boy's mother, Marjorie Kelly Weer, posted on Facebook: "Trump didn't snub my son & Monty wasn't even trying to shake his hand." Rowling, who has often criticized Mr. Trump, said she "apologized unreservedly" to the boy's family for any offense she might have caused. She tweeted Monday that "I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw." sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress /3 to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly.
