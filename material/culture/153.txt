anadian soprano Barbara Hannigan opens this album with a reminder, in no shy terms, of what a stupidly seductive vocalist she is. She flits, warbles and giggles through Berio s high-wire  from 1965; she has a way of making everything just float. The novelty of this release is that it is , and though her fierce musicianship is never in doubt   she coolly leads the Amsterdam-based Ludwig Ensemble through Berg s tough Lulu Suite and Gershwin s Girl Crazy (in a new suite arranged by Bill Elliott)   the ensemble playing doesn t match the rapture and agility of her voice. That would be a tall order. Even in the Gershwin, which to my ears doesn t suit her as well as previous recordings of Satie, Hans Abrahamsen or George Benjamin (it needs more bulk, less shimmer), her effortless style is bewitching.
