 is like a distinctive taste that you either love or hate. I have always   slightly against my better judgment   adored this exorbitant classic of a musical. First performed in 1971, it s about the reunion of a chorus line of Weismann/Ziegfeld revue girls, now middle-aged or older, gathering in an about-to-be-demolished Broadway theatre. The potential for humiliation   an unwelcome side effect of growing old   gives the storyline its weird, almost unpalatable edge, intriguingly taking the shine off sentimentality. Glamour is tainted by age, and many of the women, in their party best, are rueful about their vanished youth as they look back to find that they are, and yet are not, the same people they always were. The men, less obviously grappling with a loss of beauty, are as likely to feel they have taken a wrong turning. Do they have regrets? You bet. Did they marry the wrong person? You decide.The musical can be performed as a camp extravaganza, but as I watched Dominic Cooke s stupendous revival (the first full production since 1987), I was reflecting that while James Goldman s book is thin,  has his cake and eats it: his lyrics are sad and entertaining, sentimental and truthful. His music is as nuanced as the lives it describes. Vicki Mortimer has designed a backstage theatre with crumbling brick walls, castaway props and battered red velvet chairs, rescued from an auditorium. The set is dominated by a fire escape (useful for rising above old flames). It s a perfect setting for a piece focused on emotional salvage.Di Botcher sits at her former dressing room table and sings Broadway Baby. At first too weary to stand, and wearing clunky spectacles, she is incongruously dowdy   comic and poignant. What is wonderful is the way she revs into action, extending the line about wanting to be in a  show  until it acquires an extra syllable   an oh of yearning. Tracie Bennett s rendition of I m Still Here justifies on its own the price of a ticket. A slip of a scarlet woman, she starts anecdotally, with a worldly smile. She, too, sits for much of the song, but finishes on her feet on her own and at one point stops singing to shout:  I m still here!    an eruption of defiant pain.Dawn Hope delights with her rousing Who s That Woman? and Janie Dee is slinkily poised, giving Could I Leave You? a punitive energy that grows out of stillness. The matchless  memorably undergoes emotional upheaval as Sally, starting as a nervous chatterbox, ending with Losing My Mind, paralysed by love for Ben, her former sweetheart. As Ben, Philip Quast is impressively unimpressive, the stuffed shirt who sings like a dream and belatedly shows he is made of flesh and blood. Peter Forbes as Sally s husband, Buddy, brings affecting vitality to his put-upon role. Throughout,  girls  and their men are shadowed by younger, glittering selves. But picking up the past s dropped stitches proves perilous, and there is a neat contrivance when the showbiz lights emblazoning each letter of  Follies  partially fail and only  lies  remain. Nigel Lilley conducts a spot-on orchestra, reintroducing this bittersweet musical that, unlike its characters, is still a sensation   in its prime.
