Today, Waiting for Godot is the most celebrated of Samuel Beckett s plays, but newly digitised material from the depths of the  shows how its first audiences responded in horror to its  lavatory references , while some anticipated that  this ugly little jet of marsh-gas  from  the late James Joyce s secretary  would soon be forgotten.The correspondence about Beckett s play is among more than 100 items from the archives of 20th-century playwrights that have been digitised by the library as part of its free online resource, . It sits alongside drafts, letters, notes and manuscripts from 13 other major dramatists, including John Osborne, JB Priestley, George Bernard Shaw and Harold Pinter. Aimed at students, teachers and the general public, the new additions to the online archive range from the manuscript of Shelagh Delaney s A Taste of Honey   which a 19-year-old Delaney sent to Joan Littlewood, asking her to read it  because no matter what sort of theatrical atrocity it might be it isn t valueless as far as I m concerned    to Priestley s letters from the trenches and Beckett s production notebooks.The correspondence reveals the reaction to Waiting for Godot from the Lord Chamberlain s Office, then the censor for all British theatre. It required various  objectionable  passages to be cut from the play, including references to  piss ,  arse ,  his hand pressed to his pubis  and the falling of Estragon s trousers. The letter also takes issue with the religious allusions:  I don t like Estragon comparing himself to Christ.  This outraged Beckett, who called the changes  so preposterous that I m afraid the whole thing is off .Once the play was shown, correspondence digitised by the British Library shows how Lady Howitt called for the play to be banned over its  lavatory references . It was subsequently viewed by examiner CW Heriot, who in his report to the Lord Chamberlain said that he had  endured two hours of angry boredom  for  a piece quite without drama and with very little meaning .In scathing terms, he advised the Lord Chamberlain that he should  allow public opinion to disperse this ugly little jet of marsh-gas , reporting on how during his viewing of the play, the man next to him fled crying  brother, let me out of this! , while  several women were apologising to their escorts for having suggested a visit to such a piece .Only  a sprinkling of young persons in slacks and Marlon Brando pullovers with (according to sex) horsetails or fringes  seemed to enjoy it, Heriot wrote dismissively.In its own response to Howitt, the Lord Chamberlain s Office had described Beckett as  the late James Joyce s secretary , saying that the play had been submitted for consideration earlier that year  with some trepidation: and quite rightly, because the original was appalling, and some of the more outrageous passages were deleted, much to the author s rage .The letter continues:  What is left is unpleasant enough, but the Lord Chamberlain felt that to cut more would be tantamount to banning the whole production,  adding that  it is not an immoral play and as the Lord Chamberlain s authority does not cover matters of taste, frequently he finds that he has to pass plays which, from that angle, he would far sooner ban. Along with script extracts from Oh! What a Lovely War, and the earliest surviving draft of The Deep Blue Sea by Terence Rattigan, the new resource, which launched on Friday, includes letters Priestley wrote home during the first world war while he was in the trenches. One letter, dated 1 January 1916, is written  from my dugout (about two feet high and five feet long) by the miserable light of a guttering, little bit of candle , following a  nightmare evening  when  the troops in the frontline made two bomb attacks on [the Germans], and we d to support them .The British Library pointed to the poignant contrast between Priestley s  vivid evocations of deafening machine-gun fire  and his exclamations of gratitude:  I enjoyed the parcel hugely, and the pudding was splendid!  Priestley s experiences in the army would give him a  strong sense of class injustice , said the library, a key theme in his 1945 play An Inspector Calls.As well as contemporary reviews, production photographs, posters and programmes, the online archive also features John Osborne s notebook for his play Look Back in Anger. Although the play s title helped popularise the phrase  angry young men , which spoke to a generation of writers, the notebook reveals some of the alternative names Osborne was considering: Bargain From Strength, Man in a Rage, Close the Cage Behind You, and My Blood Is a Mile High. It also shows how he wrote the play quickly, with few revisions, with an early autobiographical section about his feelings of betrayal over his wife s affair crafted into dialogue for his protagonist Jimmy Porter.Anna Lobbenberg from the Discovering Literature team said:  In discussions we ve had with teachers, we hear stories about young people believing that classic works of literature fall out of the sky on to the printed page. And teachers have said that showing them manuscripts is a brilliant way of demonstrating   the creative process behind these works. , first digitising material relating to Victorian and Romantic writers, and then. The British Library said that it has had 5.4 million users to date.
