here s a scene in  that features Tom Cruise s  downing tequila after a successful international drug drop while Talking Heads  Slippery People blares away in the background. These are the levels of nuance present in  s based-on-a-true story action romp of Seal s involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal. By Liman s account, Seal was a slick superstar pilot who was poached by the CIA to spy on communist rabble-rousers in central and South America, flying his plane low enough overhead to take photos.Ever the enterprising American, Seal soon began dabbling in drug-running (and, later, arms-dealing) on behalf of the Medell n cartel for quick cash, the extra pocket money piling up too fast for him to count it. I do tend to leap before I look,  winks a mulleted Cruise in one of the VHS tape diary entries interspersed throughout the film to explain Seal s story in hindsight. Interspersed with animated inserts   coloured a sickly yellow   that crudely illustrate the film s backdrop of cold war politics, Liman s film is a playful, if not especially probing, jab in the ribs of Reagan s America and its interventionist politics. It also works nicely as a  star vehicle   his megawatt smile and aviator sunglasses on fine form here.
