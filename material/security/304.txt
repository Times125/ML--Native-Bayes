WELLINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Leading international cyber security specialists will discuss how New Zealand businesses can help fight cybercrime at the first government-backed Cyber Security Summit in Auckland next week, Communications Minister Amy Adams said Thursday. "Cyber-attacks can and do damage our economy. Businesses are acutely aware of the 257 million NZ dollars (178.2 million U.S. dollars) lost to cybercrime last year," Adams said in a statement. "The challenge cyber security presents can't be met by the public sector alone. What's clear is that we need a joined up response -- the private and public sectors working together to share information and expertise," she said. "The summit is an opportunity for chairs and chief executives from across New Zealand to continue the conversation around how as a country we tackle the threat of cybercrime, and improve our resilience and security in this increasingly digital age." International keynote speakers at the May 5 summit would include Jim Lewis from the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, and Matt Thomlinson, vice president of security of Microsoft.
