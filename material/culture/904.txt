Trevor Noah discussed Donald Trump s much-criticized  this week and his decision to omit important information.On The Daily Show, Noah referred to the event as  a campaign rally for the election that he just won  before remarking on the choice of Ben Carson as the warm-up act. Having Ben Carson kicking off a party is like having Ben Carson kicking off a party,  he said.  He s like the worst choice ever. During the evening, Trump remarked that he would insist on an entire government shutdown to ensure that the border wall was paid for, something that jarred with his previous comments.  What happened to  Mexico pays for the wall ?  Noah said.  That s the only reason I watched the rallies, is to see the hits. You can t just change the words to your songs, Trump! He went on to say that  most of Trump s rally was an outstanding rejection of sanity  before showing footage of him rambling on stage. I m so glad we didn t elect an irrational woman as president, I really am,  Noah said.As Trump repeated his previous statements on Charlottesville, he listed the hate groups he had mentioned.  He sounds less like a president and more like an angry waiter arguing about an order that he got wrong,  he said.One of the most talked-about moments of the rally was when Trump repeated his initial remarks on Charlottesville but left out his comment about the violence emerging from  many sides . You can t leave out  on many sides . That was the whole reason people were mad,  Noah said.  That was it. Leaving out  on many sides  erases the context of what happened. Like in any story, if you remove a crucial piece of information, of course the story will change. In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, if you remove the chocolate factory, now Willy Wonka is just a pedophile. He showed footage from outside of the rally. where tensions brewed between both sides.  In the name of unity,  set out once again to divide Americans and unfortunately, it seems to be working.
