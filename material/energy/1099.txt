 Labor s aggressive campaign against the Barnett government s planned privatisation of Western Power is on shaky ground five days out from the election after the competition tsar said it would lead to lower prices.The Labor leader, Mark McGowan, said he disagreed with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman, Rod Sims, who said electricity bills would fall if 51% of the poles and wires power utility was privatised under the Liberals.A new private owner would run it more efficiently, make it leaner and  the regulator would make sure those efficiencies resulted in lower prices , Sims told the West Australian newspaper.Reports in recent years including by the Australian Energy Regulator, Australian  Market Commission and others have tended to not find a correlation between between electricity bills and privatisation.Labor has long been warning that selling Western Power would drive up bills, reduce income to WA, lead to a drop in maintenance and servicing standards, creating bushfire risks, loss of jobs and fall into foreign hands.Sims rejected the key argument about a hit to hip pockets, because the regulator set prices.Critics of the regulator say it too easily agrees to requests by private operators to increase bills to meet rising costs.McGowan insisted that he was right but struggled to provide evidence for assertions that past privatisations of electricity had led to significant hikes. Like many West Australians I disagree with Mr Sims,  he told reporters.  He s got an eastern states/Canberra point of view. There are a range of experiences out there that show prices will go up when these sorts of assets are privatised, everybody understands that. The fact that WA was not part of the national electricity grid meant it had more more security of supply issues and regulation should not go to Canberra, he said.Sims  comments were seized on by the premier, Colin Barnett, and the treasurer, Mike Nahan, as showing up union and Labor  lies .Sims  comments about Western Power come after the Australian Services Union was recently forced to withdraw a commercial, when he complained about being portrayed  out of context  warning that privatisation leads to higher consumer prices.The Liberals claim it will raise $11bn including getting rid of $8bn of debt and $3bn in proceeds, which Labor says they are doing due to having  mismanaged the state s finances .The unions released their own report on Tuesday by Orion Consulting, claiming the government would reap a much smaller windfall with proceeds of just under $1bn.Labor released past statements by Barnett, including one from a year ago describing Western Power as critical to WA s development and saying South Australia s weak economy was due to it selling off such assets. I m not going to let WA get in that position,  he said.Labor is using that as proof he would privatise other government bodies, including the Water Corp, which Barnett said he was not contemplating.
