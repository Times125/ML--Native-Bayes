ysing Arts Centre is located deep in , a landscape of science parks and tech incubators, a place where microprocessors and bluetooth sets issue from isolated country barns. But for 12 hours on Saturday, this corner of the fen was sending out high-tech emissions of a very different kind, as Wysing Arts Centre became a satellite of NON,  turned global collective of artists.Last year s Wysing music festival enforced one rule: no electricity. This year, however, everything is electric. From the throbbing digital scree that opened London-based producer  s set to the woozy north African vocal samples used by Milan s Petit Singe, no sound came unmediated, unamplified or unprocessed.More arabesques flowed through Sami Baha s set, with its mix of influences from the sinuous melodies of vintage Turkish pop to the stuttered machine drums of Atlanta trap. Slamming white-noise synths against heavy bass drops, the Istanbul-born producer s set was the first of the day to really get the dancefloor going.Lolina (also known as Inga Copeland), by contrast, didn t inspire so many steps   in spite of her squelchy acid bass lines and detuned house piano vamps. But maybe that isn t the point. Copeland, like many acts at the festival, takes the tropes of club music and spins them around, firing them off into thrilling new sonic worlds, in which concrete sounds of footsteps and sleigh bells tussle with brittle digital artefacts and dense clouds of dub echo.The lineup this year was curated by Nkisi, of . Her set certainly provoked its share of fancy footwork, but there was more to it than only beats instrumentalised to bodily movement. Apart from anything else, the sound was too spooky, evoking 1970s Italian horror films more than .Opaque Poetics is probably the first music festival I ve been to that has featured more women on stage than men, more performers of colour than white artists. If NON s goal is to create an inclusive space for artists   and audiences   of all backgrounds, a space where high-tech can meet lo-fi and the aims of art and hedonism collide, then Nkisi and Wysing have clearly succeeded.
