LJUBLJANA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia has listed cyber security as one of government priorities after a session of the National Security Council on Tuesday, at which the issues of illegal migration and terrorist threat were put on the discussion as well. Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said cyber security became prominently important in wake of global attack last Friday even though the threat level remains low in the country, according to the Slovenian Press Agency (STA). Cerar said that the Public Administration Ministry regularly upgraded IT systems and other software, while a specialized national authority had been established this year to prepare preventive measures against such attacks. "Ensuring security in this field is one of the government's priorities," he was quoted by the STA report on Tuesday night.
