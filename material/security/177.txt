LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) Wednesday said it has released an updated guidance to candidates in the general election, as attempts have reportedly been made to steal these politicians' data. Britain will have a general election next month. Some of the candidates have been found to be targeted on their personal email addresses, according to Sky News. Given the security concern, the NCSC has made guidance available about how candidates in the General Election can protect their digital systems and online profiles. This updated guidance is part of the NCSC's ongoing cyber security guidance to political parties. It is prudent to offer political parties and candidates advice if they think they have been the victim of a phishing campaign, and NCSC technical experts are available 24/7 to provide assistance and support, said a spokesperson for the NCSC. NCSC has previously provided and published advice and guidance to political parties, local authorities and the Electoral Commission, equipping them to protect against a wide variety of threats. This includes protecting bulk data sets that typically contain large amounts of personal data. The updated guidance came as a recent global coordinated ransomware attack affected thousands of private and public sector organizations across dozens of countries.
