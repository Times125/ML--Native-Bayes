SOFIA, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian Defense Ministry will develop capabilities for cyber security intended to protect military communication and information systems for command and control, an official said here on Monday. "The increase in risks and threats in cyberspace creates conditions for increasing vulnerabilities of military command and control information systems," Bulgarian Deputy Minister of Defense Atanas Zapryanov said at a conference on the challenges to cyber security. The ministry will implement effective measures to protect its own systems, and develop cyber defense capabilities compatible with NATO, Zapryanov added. Capacity-building in this area will include the development of policies and guidance documents for cyber defense in relation to the need of protection and active counteraction against hybrid threats, cyber warfare and hybrid wars, Zapryanov said. Furthermore, a council for communication and information support, and cyber defense will be established, he said. The ministry will also implement cyber defense projects, and exploit the opportunities of Bulgaria's membership in NATO and the European Union to participate in joint initiatives and the development of common capacity and capability, Zapryanov said. His ministry plans to build an operational center for cyber defense, which would provide continuous monitoring of communication and information systems, and capabilities to respond to national and international influences. The Ministry of Defense would share information about cyber incidents and cooperate with governmental institutions, international organizations, businesses and academia. This April, Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev said after a meeting of the consultative council on national security that his country needed to improve cyber security amid intense attacks.
