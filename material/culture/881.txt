This track opens in such a suspicious and haunting way, and boy when that bassline slaps it kicks like a mule.A contemporarily relevant spin on a classic hands-in-the-air banger. Cheesy enough to get people singing; acidic enough to get people weird.I d have given this wonderful boy a good home on my label and made sure he never had nothin  leaked, capisce?! A really well-produced, very original piece of music.I m not much of a show-off, but as you ve got me, here s a little ditty from the world of French library music. Also sampled by , on her worldwide smash DJ.This hunk of a producer has been on my radar for such a long time. When I heard this track I kept expecting him to have  blown up . His production is so well thought out.This track got me out of bed this morning because it gave me nightmares in my sleep that I was a dreadful producer. I woke up in a cold sweat and realised that this nightmare was reality, and compared to this track I am a dreadful producer.The way I picture it, everyone would be swilling red wine everywhere rejoicing over the Ali Campbell chorus. This one s for you, auntie Justine!Lovely  singing me off as I m frozen and shot out of a cannon into space. I can t really think of anything better.
