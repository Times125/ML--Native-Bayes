Australia s manufacturing industry could be poised for recovery, according to a new report, which says the sector is enjoying its largest improvement in employment conditions in a decade.It says Australian manufacturing jobs have swelled by 40,000 in the past 12 months   the second-largest number of new jobs created in any industry   and productivity has returned to near its previous peak.At the same time, a new poll has found a majority of voters reject the idea that manufacturing is an outdated industry that will inevitably continue to shrink in Australia.It found more than two-thirds of Australians reject the idea that government support for manufacturing is a waste of taxpayers  money.The report, Manufacturing: A Moment of Opportunity, has been prepared by the Centre for Future Work, part of the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute.It has been released to coincide with the , hosted by the two organisations at Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday.The report says several economic indicators suggest Australian manufacturing may be poised for recovery.It says since 2008, the manufacturing sector s real output has declined by 13% (compared to its pre-financial crisis peak), and employment by a similar proportion, but the industry appears to have stabilised, and it remains one of Australia s most important.In the past 12 months, trend employment data from the Bureau of Statistics show there has been an increase of 40,000 manufacturing jobs, surpassed only by public administration and safety jobs (80,000 new positions). The report says profit margins for Australian manufacturers were hammered during the GFC, with the soaring currency doing major damage to the sector, but since 2014, profits have begun to regain some of the lost ground.Quarterly gross operating profits reached nearly $8bn in the March quarter, the highest in several years, which may soon encourage future increases in capital spending and more hiring.The report says the value of Australian-made manufactures sold to international markets has also grown dramatically in recent years, from a low of $80bn in 2009 to a record high of more than $100bn in the past 12 months.Recent data also indicate the sector allocates almost 5% of its sector value-added to new R&D expenditure, more than any other sector - including the scientific and professional services sectors.The report argues this presents an important political opening for leaders from all parties to recommit to manufacturing, and grant the sector greater priority in economic policy-making. There is more economic space than at any time in recent years to expand investment, production, and employment in value-added manufacturing,  the report says. And the public will support active measures that are consistent with this goal. The Australia Institute s Centre for Future Work also conducted a nationally representative poll of 1,408 people   between 26 April and 5 May   regarding their views about manufacturing in Australia.It found that despite low levels of understanding of the importance of manufacturing to Australia s economy at the moment, there is wide support for manufacturing across all age and voting groups.Manufacturing employs 915,000 people in Australia, making it the sixth-largest employer by industry in Australia, accounting for around 8% of all employment.But when asked to name the largest employer out of manufacturing (915,000 jobs), public administration, defence and the law (828,000 jobs), banking and financial services (433,600 jobs), wholesale trade (376,400 jobs), agriculture (293,100 jobs), and mining (240,800 jobs), only 10% of respondents correctly picked manufacturing.Most respondents (38%) thought public administration, defence and the law was the biggest employer, while more respondents chose mining (13%) and finance (11%) than the correct answer. The importance of manufacturing jobs appears to be widely underappreciated among Australians, perhaps because of the steady stream of negative headlines that have dominated most news about the sector in recent years,  the report says.However, there was widespread support for the view that manufacturing exports are important for Australia s economy, with 76% agreeing or strongly agreeing that success in global trade requires strong manufacturing exports, and 71% agreeing or strongly agreeing it was better to add value to natural resources through manufacturing than to export raw commodities.Earlier in the week the governor of the Reserve Bank .Philip Lowe said Australia s economy was suffering a  crisis  in wage growth, and workers ought to realise the relatively low unemployment rate meant they could start asking for a larger share of the nation s economic pie.
