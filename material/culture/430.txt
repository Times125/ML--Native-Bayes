his violent, high-energy Korean thriller springs to life in a neon-lit hallway. Its breathless, blood-splattered opening begins from a shooter s point of view (with a bodycam and a fisheye lens capturing much of the action), as they mow down the armed men who appear at every turn like avatars in a video game. When the shooter crashes into a full-body mirror, the image opens out and the assassin is revealed to be a young woman. Sook-hee (Ok-bin Kim) is eventually captured, though by the secret service rather than the police, before being retrained and refashioned (by way of plastic surgery) as one of their own.At two hours long, Byung-gil Jung s revengesploitation film is overstuffed and overcooked, lurching between melodrama, satire and kung fu grindhouse. At one point, the film turns into a K-drama style romcom, handsome, sensitive, devoted love interest and all (never mind the fact that he s also Sook-hee s handler, unbeknown to her). Not all of it comes together, but its balls-to-the-wall approach is riotous fun to behold, especially a climactic set piece involving apocalyptic rain, a bus, a machete and a self-driving car.
