An American Indian tribe succeeded on Tuesday in getting a federal judge to temporarily stop construction on some, but not all, of , but its broader request still hangs in the balance.James Boasberg, a US district court judge, said on Tuesday that work will temporarily stop between North Dakota s state highway 1806 and 20 miles east of Lake Oahe, but will continue west of the highway because he believes the US army corps of engineers lacks jurisdiction on private land.He also said he will rule by the end of Friday on the Standing Rock Sioux tribe s challenge of federal regulators  decision to grant permits to the Dallas, Texas-based operators of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which will cross North Dakota, , Iowa and Illinois. near Lake Oahe prompted the tribe to ask on Sunday for a temporary stop of construction. Four private security guards and two guard dogs received medical treatment, officials said, while a tribal spokesman noted that six people   including a child   were bitten by the dogs and at least 30 people were pepper-sprayed.Bill Leone, an attorney for Dakota Access, said during Tuesday s hearing that if it were not for the stoppages, the section in question would be finished by the end of this week.The Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman, Dave Archambault II, issued a statement after the ruling, saying:  Today s denial of a temporary restraining order   west of Lake Oahe puts my people s sacred places at further risk of ruin and desecration. Jan Hasselman, an attorney with Earthjustice, who filed the broader lawsuit on behalf of the tribe, noted the tribe will  know more by the end of the week about where we re heading .A spokeswoman for  Transfer Partners did not immediately respond to telephone messages requesting comment.Leone also said in court that there were two more attacks on crews in  on Tuesday. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier of Morton County said law enforcement officers pulled back from responding to a report of 150-200 protesters gathered at a construction area on private land because they determined it was not safe to respond.He said some protesters had hatchets and knives, and two secured themselves to heavy equipment. No pipeline workers were at the site, and no arrests have been made.Over the weekend, workers allegedly bulldozed sites on private land that Hasselman said in court documents was  of great historic and cultural significance to the tribe . The tribe s cultural expert, Tim Mentz Sr, said in court documents that the tribe believes there are human remains in the area and that it wants  an opportunity to rebury our relatives . The elders say that reburying can help deal with the loss and hurt of disturbing these graves,  he said.Lawyers for Energy Transfer Partners filed court documents on Tuesday morning denying that workers have destroyed any cultural sites and asking the judge to reject the tribes  request for a temporary work stoppage. The company said it  has taken and continues to take every reasonable precaution  to protect cultural sites.The US army corps of engineers did not oppose the tribe s most recent request, with assistant attorney general John Cruden saying in court documents that  the public interest would be served by preserving peace .The tribe s outstanding lawsuit attempts to halt construction of the pipeline, which is due to be finished this year. The suit says the project violates several federal laws, including the National Historic Preservation Act, will harm water supplies on the reservation and downstream .Hundreds of protesters have camped out near the reservation for weeks. The Green party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, who advocates for clean energy, spent Monday evening with them and used red spray paint to write  I approve this message  on the blade of a bulldozer, a spokeswoman said.Kirchmeier said authorities  against Stein. State court records on Tuesday evening did not yet list any formal counts against her.
