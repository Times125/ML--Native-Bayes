The amount of electricity generated from coal in the UK has fallen to zero several times in the past week, grid data shows.In what green energy supporters have described as a  historic turning point  for the UK s power system, coal-fired electricity first fell to zero late on Monday night and for the early hours of Tuesday morning, according to .On Thursday, there was no electricity from coal for more than 12 and a half hours, more than half the day, with it making no contribution to the UK s power supplies late at night when demand was low and for a period in the day, the data shows.It is thought to be the first time the UK has been without electricity from coal since the world s first centralised public coal-fired generator opened at Holborn Viaduct in London, in 1882, according to the  which reports on climate science and energy policy.The record lows in coal power generation come as the UK enters the summer months, which sees lower demand for electricity, and with more than half of the country s coal capacity out of action, for example for planned maintenance.But there have also been a series of recent closures of coal-fired power plants as they become less economic, while plants such as Drax in North Yorkshire have partially switched to burning  biomass . The government , as it is the most polluting way of generating electricity.There has also been an increase in the amount of renewables on the system, with a record 27% of the UK s power coming from sources such as wind power in the last quarter of 2015.Estimates of the power now being generated from solar panels, from household arrays to large scale farms, also show it is regularly outstripping coal during the day, reaching 6.8 gigawatts (GW) at a midday peak this week compared to a high of 3GW output from coal.Solar is limited to generating power during the day, but analysis from Carbon Brief found that over the course of a week, the clean technology produced more power last week than coal.Juliet Davenport, chief executive of renewable electricity supplier Good  said:  This week marks an historic turning point for energy in the UK. Coal formed the backbone of the industrial revolution and was the fuel that powered Britain into the 21st century. But it s time to begin to say farewell. Our energy is becoming cleaner and greener, with wind, solar and other renewables generating more of our electricity than ever before. We are celebrating this news as it shows that our future can be fossil fuel-free.
