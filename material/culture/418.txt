his gender-swap of Peter Berg s 1998 film  is a Very Bad Thing indeed.  stars as Jess, a wannabe politician and bride-to-be who is whisked off to Miami by her college gal pals for her bachelorette party. The gang (comprising Jillian Bell, Zo? Kravitz, Ilana Glazer, Kate McKinnon and no detectable chemistry) accidentally kill a male stripper and must figure out what to do with the body. McKinnon gets a couple of good lines as Jess s Aussie friend Pip ( singer-songwriter is the dream; party clown is the reality ), but even the film s saltiness feels safe. Gags about piss and penis pasta, vibrators and?self-waxing strips confuse vagina-related  jokes  with a feminist?perspective, as signalled by Jess s plan to win a game of beer pong  for womankind  in the opening scene.
