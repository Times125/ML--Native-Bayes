The Turnbull government has moved to hose down intensifying internal concerns about rising power prices by confirming its intention to restrict gas exports, and by opening the way for an alternative to the clean energy target proposed by Australia s chief scientist.The prime minister confirmed on Tuesday the government would proceed with its  forcing gas companies to supply the domestic market and would    a controversial legal mechanism that contributes to high power prices.Turnbull also flagged his intention to ask the Australian  Market Operator (Aemo) to provide new advice to the government about how to ensure dispatchable power was made available while  optimising affordability for consumers .Coalition MPs have complained the  of the national electricity market does not address this question in substance.The Minerals Council of Australia, a Finkel review critic, has been lobbying government backbenchers this week for consideration of a reverse auction scheme to deal with the dispatchable power issue.The chairman of the Coalition s backbench energy and environment committee, Craig Kelly   a critic of the clean energy target proposed by the Finkel review   told Guardian Australia the government needed to consider implementing reverse auctions to deploy dispatchable power into the grid. We need more dispatchable power in New South Wales and Victoria and one potential way of doing this is a reverse auction to supply that power into the grid,  Kelly said on Monday.The Liberal MP said the reverse auction scheme would need to be set with an emissions intensity threshold to allow high-efficiency coal to bid into the system but he said coal could be outbid by wind power with gas back-up, or large-scale solar with battery back-up.On Tuesday, Turnbull told reporters Aemo may recommend a reverse auction scheme to the government  consistent with practice in many other jurisdictions, including the United States and the UK and Germany and others .But he denied his new brief for Aemo was a clear signal the government had either dumped, or was paving the way to dump Finkel s clean energy target. I wouldn t analyse it in that way if I was you,  the prime minister said.Having lobbied for consideration of the reverse auction scheme, the Minerals Council of Australia welcomed Turnbull s announcement on Tuesday. This is an important and timely initiative that will help provide Australian households and businesses with reliable and low-cost energy over the medium and long term,  the MCA s chief executive, Brendan Pearson, said.The MCA has also taken issue with the modelling underpinning the Finkel review, which has unsettled some MPs. Kelly and fellow Liberal MP David Fawcett met with the economists who did the Finkel modelling at parliament on Tuesday.The government s public declarations on Tuesday, on the steps it will take to lower power prices, reflects deep-seated concern in the party room that the government has made itself politically responsible for the issue through its year-long campaign to position the  as the party of low power prices.The clean energy target recommended by Finkel also faces stiff opposition in government ranks, with some MPs claiming it will push up power prices.The Coalition party room on Tuesday endorsed the main thrust of the Finkel review s recommendations, but did not tick the clean energy target. It has been sent for what government sources characterise as  further work .Turnbull told reporters the government was acutely aware that electricity prices  and energy pries generally are absolutely a top priority issue for all Australian families and businesses . We absolutely understand that,  the prime minister said.Asked whether anything the government had announced would have an immediate impact, and prevent electricity prices rising by 20% and gas prices rising by 17%, the prime minister said invoking the export controls for gas  obviously can have a short-term impact .The LNG industry has fiercely opposed the export controls since they were floated by the government earlier this year.Turnbull shrugged off concerns about sovereign risk.  Our first duty is to protect our people, our businesses, our households,  he said.The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said on Tuesday the legal process of limited merits review had added $6.5bn in costs to consumers through so-called  gold plating  of electricity infrastructure.Frydenberg has made a previous effort through the energy council of the Council of Australian Governments to abolish limited merits review but the federal push was rebuffed by Queensland and New South Wales.The Greens signalled on Tuesday they would look to cooperate on limited merits review. Network charges make up almost half an electricity bill,  the Greens  climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said.  If we can stop big power companies overspending on poles and wires, and make them invest in energy savings and networks that support renewables, we can help reduce pollution and cut power bills .But the energy sector responded with alarm.  Networks Australia chief executive John Bradley said the government s plan to unilaterally abolish regulatory appeals  rides roughshod over the federal court and the intergovernmental agreement underpinning the national energy market . Wholesale market and retail costs have been driving increases, while network costs have been falling,  Bradley said. The decision sidelines Coag energy council decision-making, less than a week after the Finkel blueprint tried to address dysfunctions in intergovernmental decision-making . This action would undermine basic foundations of the energy market   legislating away the powers of state governments, the role of the courts and the right to correct regulatory errors .
