Serious is the condition in between critical -- the worst state -- and fair, in medical terms. The hospital said it would provide more details about Scalise's condition on Thursday. Scalise, two members of the U.S. Capitol Police, a current GOP staffer and a lobbyist were injured in early June when a gunman opened fire on a GOP practice for a congressional baseball game. The other victims have since been released from the hospital, but doctors have said Scalise would take weeks to recover and be rehabilitated. When he arrived at the hospital, Scalise was in "imminent risk of death," one doctor said.
