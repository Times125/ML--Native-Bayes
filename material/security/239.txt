SINGAPORE, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will set up a new Cyber Security Agency under the Prime Minister's Office, the government said on Tuesday. The agency, which will start operating in April, will be charged with coordinating public and private sector efforts to protect national systems such as those in the energy and banking sectors from increasing cyber threats. Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim will be the minister in charge of cyber security. David Koh, 50, deputy secretary of technology at the Ministry of Defence, will be its chief executive. The new agency will plug current cyber defence gaps, such as breaches involving obscure companies that could potentially compromise the security of citizen data, given that computer systems are more connected nowadays. Koh will retain his current position at the Ministry of Defence. The new agency will have "hundreds" of dedicated technical and policy development staff, with most being transferred from the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Infocomm Development Authority. The new agency will work with existing security setups by the Infocomm Development Authority such as the Cyber-Watch Center and the Monitoring and Operations Control Center to coordinate incident management.
