Plans to drill for oil in the pristine Great Australian Bight marine park will significantly increase the risk of oil spills, both from the oil rigs and the increased shipping traffic, according to .In an updated plan for how the government would handle an oil spill, the department included a specific note about increased risks posed by plans for extensive oil exploration in the Great Australian Bight. There are four licence holders entitled to install rigs. If all four install rigs, it will significantly increase the risk to  not only through the presence of oil rigs, but also in the increase in marine traffic this will cause,  the report notes.Among the licence holders, BP is set to be the first to install an oil rig in 2016, and  it planned to do so in parts of the Great Australian Bight protected in commonwealth marine parks.In 2010, BP was responsible for the world s largest oil spill   the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico   which occurred in calmer and more shallow waters than those in the Bight.BP hasn t released modelling of the impacts of an oil spill, but  commissioned by the Wilderness Society showed it would be catastrophic, impacting the entire southern coast of Australia.The department s report appears to acknowledged the potentially extensive impacts, spreading into Western Australia.  The intended drilling activities increases both the South Australian and West Australian risk profile with respect to possible spills,  the report says.It notes that arrangements for a response to such a spill are ongoing with BP, which has had its  by the regulator. The reasons for that rejection were kept secret, and it is understood BP will be submitting new plans this month.Peter Owen, South Australia Director for the Wilderness Society, said a spill from an oil rig in the Bight could force the shutting of fisheries across the length of the southern coast from Tasmania to Western Australia. It s about time the South Australian government acknowledged that drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight threatens marine life and fisheries,  said Owen., the area in which BP is going to install its two oil rigs was inscribed in the reserve system for a range of reasons, including being a  globally important seasonal calving habitat for the threatened southern right whale  and important foraging areas for sea lions, white sharks and sperm whales.The process around the approval of BP s drilling has been criticised in a Senate inquiry , with federal government approval devolved to , an agency that specifically deals with offshore oil and gas applications.BP maintains that oil and gas exploration can safely coexist with the marine environment.  We have assessed potential environmental issues from exploration activities in the Great Australian Bight and in turn incorporated this into our planning,  a spokeswoman .
