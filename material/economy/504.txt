Nikil Saval writes that  Globalisation could take place in services, capital and ideas   but what it meant most often was making it cheaper to trade across borders  (, 15 July). We hear no more from him about cross-border movements of capital. When I studied economics in the 1950s we spoke of  capital flight  as a major cause of economic stagnation and regulatory capture. The rich in most of South America appeared to be free to invest their winnings in US equities to the detriment of their local industries. My pension fund invests more abroad than in UK equities. Am I complicit in a?modern version of capital flight? Could it be that another tenet of conventional wisdom needs to be challenged: that free movement of capital across borders benefits us all?  The main drivers of environmental destruction (, 11 July) are over-population and economic growth. Over-population is caused by poverty. Economic growth   seen by most as a good thing   is needed only to service debt. This was pointed by CH Douglas s Social Credit movement in the 1920s and more recently by EF Schumacher and others. Allowing banks to issue 97% of money as debt is at the heart of the problem.
