 is a real tonic. I defy anyone not to smile at  s effervescent readings of Haydn s graceful and urbane cello concertos in C major and in D major. He spins an exquisitely light and agile line, maintaining a delightfully sunny disposition, even in each concerto s adagio. These works make good-natured partners to CPE Bach s more earnest but equally tuneful concerto in A major, and we find some discoveries along the way too: the aria Geme la tortorella, from Mozart s a, arranged by Isserlis for cello, and Boccherini s delicately sweet adagio from his rarely heard concerto in G major. The Bremen players add just the right degree of elegance and poise to make this a CD to treasure.
