WASHINGTON -- Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is set to testify in public before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday about Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The hearing, scheduled for 10 a.m., comes after testimony from Attorney General Jeff Sessions this week and former FBI Director James Comey last week before the Senate. Both hearings touched on the federal investigation into Russian interference and possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials. Johnson led the Department of Homeland Security amid Russian cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta, as well as attacks against state election databases last year. He advised states on how to protect themselves ahead of the election on Nov. 8. During the last open hearing held by the House Intelligence panel, former CIA Director John Brennan told lawmakers that Russia may have successfully tried to recruit U.S. persons to influence the election. Brennan also said he was aware of intelligence and information that revealed contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign. He couldn't say, however, whether or not the activities amounted to collusion. At its earlier Russia hearing in March, Comey testified alongside National Security Agency (NSA) Director Admiral Mike Rogers. During the hearing, the former FBI director confirmed that his agency was running an investigation into possible connections or coordination between Trump's associates and the Russian government. Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, is expected to chair Wednesday's hearing since the panel's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, recused himself from the Russia probe a few months ago. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, is the committee's ranking member.
