 wonder when, months ago, Malcolm Turnbull decided to go to war against state-based renewable energy targets as a means of trying to wedge Labor on climate policy, and show voters his government cared about hip-pocket issues – whether he ever imagined he’d be standing behind a podium, making threatening noises about gas exports?I strongly suspect not.It really doesn’t loom as an obvious agenda item on the bucket list of a Liberal prime minister, standing up in the prime minister’s press conference room at Parliament House and declaring: “The commonwealth government has enormous power in this area, as you know.“We have the ability to control exports.”As political Kabuki goes, that’s pretty high-octane. But as we all know, these are strange times.So why is the prime minister muttering darkly about the commonwealth’s constitutional powers when it seems that just five minutes ago, the villain of the piece was sub-optimal ?Because Turnbull has kicked the energy policy hornets nest.By training the political spotlight squarely on energy security and climate policy, Turnbull has opened a massive, multi-faceted, complicated, significant and deadly serious set of policy issues – which he has now made his government entirely responsible for fixing.This is what happens when you kick the hornets nest.Chaos ensues, and you end up at a podium, in parliament house, going Full Metal Export – talking up your constitutional options if an industry doesn’t do the right thing and deliver sufficient supply to the domestic market to meet peaking electricity demand.Given how quickly events in this space are unfolding, and given the high risk of disorientation from all the twists and turns – let’s just take a short breath and note where we are.Let’s observe that the prime minister has backed himself and his government squarely into this corner – the fix the crisis (we generated for unrelated purposes) corner.Because lying beneath the surface of a cheap and cheerful let’s get back into the game political strategy for 2017 was, always, a seething mass of real-world problems that are the consequence of more than a decade of abject public policy failure.Problems that need to be fixed by responsible adults elected to represent our interests – and quickly.So will Wednesday’s emergency gas summit fix the problems?On the plus side, the gas companies, under intense political pressure, have made a public commitment to supplying the domestic market periods of peak demand.We have absolutely zero fine print about how that commitment will actually work, and who might bear the costs of it – but the basic principle is useful.But supplying more gas to the domestic market isn’t anything even close to a magic wand.For the commitment to make a practical difference, there also needs to be sufficient generation capacity available, and in functional condition, to use the fuel – and that has been a significant part of the problem in recent times.It’s been enough of a problem to prompt the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill,  in the state.South Australia building its own power station is another thing you mightn’t have seen coming six months ago.But here we all are. Thundering about the constitution and building power stations after two decades of privatisation.Turnbull also indicated two of the LNG exporters present at Wednesday’s meeting “gave a commitment to being net domestic gas contributors, as part of their social licence”.I’m not sure that commitment, which is obviously a handy thing to announce, represented anything more than a bit of deft market signalling – companies saying publicly what they had planned to do in any case.But despite my quibbles with absent facts and absent fine print, the one great positive to come out of the Great War On Windfarms is we are slowly but surely beginning to grapple with what is actually wrong with our creaking energy system, and what might need to change as a consequence.A political strategy is now beginning to morph into something approximating a whole of government response to the unconscionable public policy botch-up of the last decade.There’s a long way to go, and we’d all be mugs to let hope triumph over the dead weight of lived experience, particularly given the resting irrationality about climate policy in this country – but the current trajectory is worth watching.
