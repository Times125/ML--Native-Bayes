WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has called Arizona Sen. John McCain to wish him well following McCain's cancer diagnosis. A White House official confirmed the conversation Thursday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity despite the president's repeated criticism of unnamed sources. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said earlier Thursday at a White House briefing that the president wishes McCain a full and speedy recovery. She says, "We know that he will bring that unflappable spirit to his latest challenge." Earlier in the day, McCain said he's grateful for the outpouring of support after his brain cancer diagnosis. He's promising to be back soon. In a tweet Thursday, McCain says: "I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I'll be back soon, so stand-by!" McCain's office said late Wednesday that the 80-year-old senator had been diagnosed with cancer. Doctors in Arizona removed a blood clot above his left eye last Friday. Pathology tests revealed a brain tumor associated with the clot. McCain has been recuperating at his home in Arizona.
