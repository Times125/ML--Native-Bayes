WELLINGTON, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand and Australia have begun working together on initiatives to strengthen trans-Tasman cyber security, New Zealand Communications Minister Amy Adams said Thursday. Adams said she had recently held talks in Sydney with Australian Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security Dan Tehan, and they had agreed to work together on a range of initiatives that would benefit both countries. Areas of interest included boosting cyber skills, building the cyber capability of small and medium-sized businesses, and cooperating on joint awareness-raising campaigns. The initiatives would bolster the government's approach to cyber security issues, and further align Australia and New Zealand's public-private awareness initiatives and workforce readiness to reduce the cyber threat in the Asia-Pacific region. "Australia and New Zealand enjoy a productive relationship on cyber issues. Working together means we can better respond to challenges and be prepared to deal with serious cyber security threats that could affect both our nations," Adams said in a statement. "Many New Zealand businesses operate in Australia and vice versa, and our citizens travel regularly between the two countries. We're committed to cooperating at a practical level to help our communities be safe online and ensure they're making the most of the digital economy," she said. "Collaboration and close international partnerships are a key part of implementing New Zealand's 2015 Cyber Security Strategy. Working alongside like-minded countries, such as Australia, is important to ensure we are cyber secure."
