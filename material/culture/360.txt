he sculptor Pygmalion renounces love before falling for one of his own creations (the image of a  perfect  woman, whatever that looks like). He then persuades Venus to bring the statue to life. In Rameau s hands, the myth becomes a seductive    a one-act comic opera heavy on instrumental numbers, almost more dance than song. It is glowing, gregarious music and was one of Rameau s most popular pieces during his lifetime. This new recording from  and his French baroque specialists Les Talens Lyriques demonstrates why. The playing is sumptuous, broad and vibrant. Cyrille Dubois sounds rapt and vigorous as Pygmalion, a natural for Rameau style, which is as much about acting as singing. C line Scheen is more piquant as the statue. We also get a graceful, earthy performance of Rameau s orchestral suite Les F tes de Polymnie.
