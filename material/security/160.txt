In an official statement it said all impacted APM Terminals are open and operations are stabilising while productivity is increasing. The Maasvlakte 2 terminal in Rotterdam is now open for export and import operations via the gate and expects to initiate vessel and rail operations on Thursday. Meanwhile, for Maersk Line, the major IT systems are up and running and its online booking portal My.Maerskline.com is online. The portal currently supports functionalities such as booking and printing of bills of lading. More functionalities are expected in the coming days and the portal now operates at normal traffic levels. The statement added that the work towards bringing container track and trace functionality, all booking systems, and other customer facing applications back online is progressing well. The backlog of bookings from the past week is being processed, the statement added. The transport giant said that Damco, its freight forwarding and logistics subsidiary remains operational across its main products, although the unit is working through significant backlogs of its EDI bookings from the past days. On the cause of the cyber attack, Maersk revealed that unlike previously stated, at this point it understands the source to be not the so-called 'Petya' virus although it declined to comment further while it continues the investigations into the source of the attack in co-operation with its partners and agencies.
