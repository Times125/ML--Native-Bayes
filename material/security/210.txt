PRAGUE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A training which aims to defend the Czech Republic's critical information infrastructure against cyber attacks was held in the eastern Czech city of Brno on Monday. Experts from Czech state offices and companies participated the training, which was organised by Masaryk University and the National Security Office (NBU). The participants are trying to find loopholes in the defence of the state system that hackers could exploit on Monday, and they will wage a virtual battle with the attackers on Tuesday. The training, held at Masaryk University, tests not only the technical skills of the participants, but also their ability to cooperate and react to the media. Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, who recently became the target of hackers, also visited the training on Monday. Some e-mails were stolen from Sobotka's private e-mail account and were published. In reaction to the hacking, Sobotka ordered a security check at the government office. Sobotka said the National Cyber Security Centre, a part of NBU, would submit a report on the defects in the cyber security of the Czech Republic to the government within one month, then the government will take steps to reinforce the cyber security. The training follows an earlier one which was organised by the Czech National Security Authority and Masaryk University in October 2015. Participants from ministries and other authorities trained to defend a simulated network of a nuclear power plant at that time.
