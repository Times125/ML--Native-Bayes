Muscular, honest, funny   The Queen is Dead has all the most endearing traits of the Smiths dialled up to the max, and is thought of by many as the band s masterpiece album. With Bigmouth Strikes Again, There is a Light That Never Goes Out and The Boy With the Thorn in His Side, it certainly contains many of their signature songs.It s now getting the full dad-pleasing Christmas box set treatment: a 3xCD and DVD combo with the original album, demos and B-sides, , and Live in Boston, an unreleased recording of a gig during their 1986 US tour (the LA date of which produced the much-coveted bootleg album Thank Your Lucky Stars).We ve got an exclusive first play of one of those live tracks, a medley that goes from Rubber Ring (one of Noel Gallagher s favourite Smiths songs, FYI), to a swinging rendition of What She Said, and back to Rubber Ring again. A nice curio to tide you over until .
