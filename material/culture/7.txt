he 250th anniversary of Telemann’s death has not been widely marked, but this scintillating disc should reassert his claim to be one of the most inventive composers of the 18th century. The colourfully varied collection of instruments on display include a mandolin, hammered dulcimer, harp and a special lute called a calchedon. There are braying horns and strident trumpets, while three perky oboes compete for attention with three violins in a memorably energetic B flat concerto I recall from Musica Antiqua K?ln’s pioneering recording. The Berlin Akademie für Alte Musik, celebrating its own 35th year, adds sophistication and a dash of edgy charm to the period instrument sounds.
