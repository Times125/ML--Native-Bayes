Lu Wei, head of the Cyberspace Administration of China, addresses the closing ceremony of 2015 World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, east China's Zhejiang Province, Dec. 18, 2015. (Xinhua/Li Xin) WUZHEN, Zhejiang, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- The second World Internet Conference ended on Friday, but the world need to keep working together for a safer and better online community. China and the United States, home to the world's two largest online populations, have set a good example. Top officials from the two countries convened early this month in Washington for the first round of cyber security talks after the two sides reached agreement on anti-hacking cooperation. Establishing global platforms to promote debate and dialogue, such as the World Internet Conference, is a good way to exchange ideas and seek cooperation on a larger scale. Microphone diplomacy and pointing fingers will not solve any problems. Governments, companies, and other parties should collaborate more to cope with new challenges that emerge with the arrival of the Internet age. From establishing a code of behavior to helping each other fight threats and cyber crime, there is much more the world can do together to make the Internet a more secure and empowering place.
