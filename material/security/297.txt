WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 (Xinhua) -- The third China-U.S. ministerial dialogue on fighting cyber crimes was held here Wednesday. The dialogue was co-chaired by China's State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Guo Shengkun with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson. In his remarks to the meeting, Guo noted that under the auspices of Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama, China-U.S. cooperation in safeguarding cyber security is booming and has yielded positive outcomes in cracking down on cyber crimes and related matters. Calling the current China-U.S. cooperation in cyber security a link between past and future, Guo proposed that the two sides press on in using the dialogue mechanism as the main channel for communication in tackling cyber security issues, give prompt and effective response to the requests from the other side, and constructively manage their differences. The U.S. side said that China and the United States share common interests in fighting cyber crimes and protecting cyber security, and the high-level dialogue mechanism also serves as a crucial platform for candid communication and enhancing mutual understanding and trust between law enforcement officials of the two countries. U.S. officials also called for continuing and developing the current dialogue mechanism to jointly fighting cyber crimes, including cyber terrorism and e-mail fraud. The two sides agreed to convene the next cyber security ministerial dialogue in China in 2017.
