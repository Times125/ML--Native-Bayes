 is a writer famous for his seemingly unstoppable exuberance on the page   although, surprisingly, he has quite frequently spoken about his fragility when it comes to the writing process. In particular, he says he fears revealing anything he is still working on, when it is too  delicate . He tells a story of once showing an early part of The Moor s Last Sigh to a few people and how even though they said they liked it, the experience clammed him up for three months, during which he was unable to write another word.The way to get round such problems, he says, is that when you re writing, you must  fool yourself into thinking it s a private act . During the years he shuts himself away to work on his novels, he tries not to imagine any audience at all. It sounds like a sensible strategy. But after the instant success of Midnight s Children in 1981, putting the public s interest out of mind for the next one must have been a serious challenge. He must have been aware that his first paragraph, especially, would have to bear an unusual weight of expectation and excitement   I felt a frisson myself when I opened Shame almost 35 years later. And here s what I found:I m unsure how I feel about that first sentence. I like the cheeky not-quite-fairy-tale-feel. And now I ve read more of the book I understand the heavy irony in calling the sisters  lovely  and  loving . But when I first read it, I was mainly distracted by trying to work out exactly what an  ill-proportioned dumb-bell  looks like.But distraction may well have been part of the intent. The real power of this sentence is the way it softens us up for what follows. That familiar once-upon-a-time rhythm and the sense it gives us of flying above the map, makes the plunge into the dark cupboards   and extreme strangeness   of the next monstrous bit of prose all the more vertiginous. Who else would dare write like that? I can t think of another author who would get away with those interruptions. Who could bring in such dizzying circumlocutions. And then delay getting to the point still further by talking about the  delay  he has already caused. And then finally give us that closure with a gong-banging tricolon of rhyming spondees. It s outrageous.And I say that even before I ve started working on the meaning. Here too, the sentence is overloaded and full of delights. It s impossible not to start speculating about the nature of that  tragedy . I also started wondering what kind of place they lived in, where you could lose not just the china but the cupboard it was stored in. And then, oh boy, you realise it s a 1,000-piece China set, and it s travelled all the way over (to where? and when?) from tsarist Russia   what kind of huge house must this story be set in? There are so many hints and allusions about wealth and loss and about soon-to-be-teased-out story strands that it left me reeling.Which made the punches of the next one-sentence paragraph land all the harder: And one day their father died. Only  father  in that sentence has more than one syllable. It s like a left and a right, a left and right, a left-right and a final killer left. As I say: outrageous.If Rushdie was nervous about how people might embrace the opening of Shame, he clearly decided to meet them head on, horns down. He s also, obviously, showing off. I can just about imagine there could be some readers who might not enjoy such an all-out assault of words. But I was immediately enraptured. These two paragraphs made me stop worrying about the shadow of Midnight s Children. And, better still, once he d pummelled me into submission, Rushdie then got down to the more straightforward and important business of storytelling.Reading a whole novel as excessive as that opening would be exhausting, so Rushdie sensibly smooths things out quickly. The third paragraph is still brilliant   but it s far more regular, as in this first sentence:There s far less to get worked up about there. And so it goes on through most of what I ve read so far. Every so often, Rushdie will let off a bright and fizzing firework   but not at the expense of the story and the deeper meaning.On this latter subject, it quickly becomes apparent that Shame is a book with a lot to say. It is a  novel not totally removed from politics , as Tariq Ali said with charming understatement, while. Behind that ecstatic language and giddy prose, there s a steady, cold anger. That intriguingly large house, which only has inward looking windows, and whole wings rotting with neglect, isn t just an enjoyable imaginative feat. It quickly starts to feel like a tragic metaphor. The novel may start with a wonderful unworldly fairytale feel   but it soon becomes an urgent commentary on real-world politics. It starts, in short, to feel like a book that matters for its own sake.
