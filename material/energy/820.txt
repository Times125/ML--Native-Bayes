Congress quashed the hopes late Tuesday of reviving the United States  export credit agency, which had been aiming for a stopgap lifeline allowing them to approve more than $20bn in new deals, many of which pose imminent harms to the environment.Now, the fate of a pristine coral reef, an east African mangrove forest, and the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen in a south-east Asian river delta lie in the hands of a new Congress and president.Since 2009, when Barack Obama became president, the Export-Import Bank has signed almost $34bn worth of low-interest loans and guarantees to companies and foreign governments to build, expand and promote fossil fuel projects abroad,  by the Guardian and Columbia University s Graduate School of Journalism s Energy and Environmental Reporting Project.That spending has undermined Obama s record on climate change emissions. And critics say several proposed bank financing projects would further erode Obama s climate legacy, undercutting the carbon reductions he has made domestically with new emissions abroad.Among the roughly 30 new projects the bank is considering are a coal-fueled power plant in Vietnam s Mekong delta; a natural gas liquefaction plant in Mozambique; power plants in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan; and a petrochemical complex in Egypt expected to emit 3m metric tonnes of greenhouse gases annually. Financing projects like this are both a climate disaster and they also have these local impacts,  said Kate DeAngelis, an international policy analyst at Friends of the Earth.Whether the bank can, or will, finance these projects is uncertain.Lawmakers were expected to take action this week that would have revived the authority of the bank to pursue at least $20bn in deals that have been piling up since July 2015, when it was blocked from financing new deals costing more than $10m. But a stopgap funding measure unveiled on Tuesday didn t include a provision. Congress is expected to vote on the bill later this week.Democrats and a majority of Republicans support the bank, but a few Republicans, led by Alabama senator Richard Shelby, have blocked the bank from being fully operational for more than a year. Shelby, chairman of the Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs, has refused to hold hearings for new board appointees.Supporters say the bank s limitations have put American jobs and the wellbeing of US businesses on the line. A year ago, General Electric announced plans to shift more than 500 jobs from three states to France, China and Hungary because US export financing wasn t available.Supporters had hoped to incorporate language in this week s budget bill allowing the bank s board to approve deals costing more than $10m without a quorum. The bank is one board member short.Andy Koenig, vice-president for policy at the conservative non-profit Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, said many of the pending deals are  as close to the approval process as they can possibly get  and could be  disbursed and go in rapid succession  if the bank s deal-making power is restored.He added that little is known about which foreign companies and US exporters would benefit. We have a lot of questions about what s in those pending transactions,  he said.Caroline Scullin, senior vice-president for communications at the bank, said the bank does not disclose financial information about projects, including the amount of proposed financing, until the deal is added to the board s agenda. She said the Mozambique LNG project is unlikely to come before the board for several months.In the Mozambique province of Cabo Delgado, a proposal to construct an onshore liquefied natural gas plant could result in the relocation of thousands, the destruction of fragile coral reefs, and greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to an  of carbon dioxide each year, more than an average coal plant, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.In 2010, Texas-based firm Anadarko struck gaseous gold about 30 miles offshore: enough natural gas to  on land that  call home. As part of the proposal, an underwater pipeline would be constructed to move gas from drill ships to an onshore processing plant.Offshore reserves have since yielded discoveries of an estimated 75tn cubic ft of gas, more than two and half times .The discovery of natural gas, which would be liquefied onshore before its transport to local and foreign markets such as China and India, has the potential to revive Mozambique s plunging national economy and stimulate job growth and investment in infrastructure like roads and hospitals.But although the plant s initial design was revised to avoid the most sensitive habitats, Anadarko s environmental impact assessment spells out a list of wide-ranging consequences: clearance of mangroves, introduction of invasive species from ballast shipping water, greenhouse gas and toxic sulfur dioxide emissions, soil erosion, and ecological losses to wetlands and the birds, reptiles and amphibians that inhabit them. Coastal seabeds would be dredged to create shipping lanes and a corridor for the 30 mile-long pipeline, which scientists say could damage coral reef networks.Natural gas, which is made up primarily of methane, burns cleaner than coal and oil. But methane, which scientists say is more than 30 times as potent as carbon dioxide in its greenhouse effect, frequently leaks from pipes, wells and processing plants.  are consistently underestimated, and the  in 2016 designed to curb methane leakage.Even so, said Anadarko spokesman John Christiansen, the fuel source  is vital toward reaching carbon-reduction objectives as stated by the  on multiple occasions .It s unclear if the bank will finance the project and, if so, for how much. Officials from Anadarko declined to provide details, and bank officials say the amount of proposed funding is considered business confidential.Because of the magnitude of the Mozambique project, if the bank doesn t provide financing Anadarko will have to look to other foreign export credit agencies, said Christiansen.There are 38 other .The bank is also considering , despite moves starting in 2014 to limit such financing to only the poorest countries. Congress has since taken actions to allow the bank to finance coal projects in countries that are not among the world s most impoverished, such as Vietnam.The Long Phu 1 power plant, which is currently under construction near Vietnam s Mekong delta, threatens nearby farms and the local fishing industry, say environmentalists.And although the bank recognizes the plant could have significant environmental and social impacts, supporters say it will provide electricity for the growing demands of towns and cities in southern Vietnam. Government projections say that by 2030, coal is likely to be the country s most relied upon source of electricity.The Vietnam government has that will receive special monitoring for environmental pollution.Hang Nguyen, management assistant for the non-profit sustainable energy group Green Innovation and Development Centre, praised the plant s proposed use of a cleaner and more modern form of power generation. Even so, she said:  It still leaves a big concern about the environmental and social impacts. I really don t know why the US Ex-Im Bank decides to consider funding for coal power plants in Vietnam because the policy of Barack Obama is quite strong,  Nguyen said.  We thought that Obama wanted to stop coal in the US and he also wanted to stop coal in other countries.
