  Instagram has been criticised after adding a feature to its app that reveals which way people have voted. Users can add a poll when adding a picture to their Instagram "story", and can see what their followers choose. Many users said they did not realise their choice would be visible to the poll instigator, and some said they had made embarrassing mistakes. Instagram said users were warned that their vote would not be anonymous, the first time they engaged with a poll. It also announced the feature on its blog, however not every Instagram user will have read it. Some people said they had cast questionable votes on polls, such as "Do I look cute?" or "Do you like my art?" without realising their choice would be shared. Why did no one inform me the instagram polls aren t anonymous. I ve been answering  no  to all the  do you think I m cute/pretty  questions.

Instagram said in a statement: "We love how the community is embracing the poll sticker to get their friends and followers' opinions. "The first time a user sees the poll sticker, they see a notification informing them that the story creator will be able to see how they voted."
