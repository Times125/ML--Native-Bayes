House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, has left the intensive care unit at MedStar Washington Hospital, but remains in serious condition as he continues to be treated for infection, an aide told CBS News. Scalise was wounded from a gunshot to the hip at a GOP congressional baseball game practice on June 14 and arrived at the hospital in critical condition. One doctor described Scalise as being in "imminent risk of death" when he first arrived. He has remained in the hospital recovering since the attack, leaving the ICU, but was readmitted on July 5. Scalise then underwent surgery for the management of infection one day following his readmission to the ICU. According to a statement from the hospital released on behalf of the Scalise family, "He tolerated the procedure well." Despite the successful surgery in early July and his recent removal from the ICU, Scalise is currently in serious condition, and the hospital continues to treat him for infection.  In addition to Scalise, a GOP staffer, a lobbyist and two members of the U.S. Capitol Police were also injured by the gunman who opened fire at the baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia. The other victims have since been released from the hospital.
