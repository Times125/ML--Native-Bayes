By Anthony Tucker, our Science Correspondent28 March 1967Scientists and technologists at the oil disaster operations centre at Plymouth are desperately sifting ideas which might avert a major coastal catastrophe. But there is no hope of any sudden change in the pattern of the defensive procedure.The 1,200-yard long boom of large polyurathene blocks, which might be used round the wreck, is being assembled at Devonport, where it will be fitted with an underwater skirt and a containing net. Six 250-foot lengths of shallow, anti-submarine boom, light enough to be towed by small boats, have been fitted with hessian panels and are deployed as sweepers in the rivers Fal and Helford to protect oyster beds.There are 300,000 gallons of oil dispersant in stock, mainly held in readiness by the Navy, and another 77,000 gallons have been distributed to local authorities. Working under emergency conditions, the Services are adapting equipment   from pumps to scoops   which might be brought into use. Among the 150 or so ideas that have come forward from the public, the majority of them concerned with lifting the wreck, or providing sweeps and booms, the idea for a shallow polythene device  is among a handful which will be tested. There is little doubt that once the oil has escaped from the region of the wreck the only way to prevent coastal damage is to sweep the sea. Although oil on the high seas has been a potential hazard for more than half a century, no one has seriously considered the practical problems involved in a major spillage, nor taken steps to design and test devices.Theoretically, a shallow curtain wall forming a circle one and a half kilometres in diameter could contain the entire cargo of a ship the size of the Torrey Canyon at an oil depth of about 10 centimetres. Such a curtain, slowly, winched in, would be capable of both retaining the oil and maintaining an adequate oil level during a pumping-off operation.But, marine operations are never as easy as they sound. Any work carried out in the vicinity of a massive oil pool is hazardous, and the effects of wind, current, waves, and ship movement multiply the difficulties of every step of the operation.
