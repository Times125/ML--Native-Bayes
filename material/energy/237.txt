The Environmental Protection Agency has issued a health warning against barramundi caught in the recreational fishing ponds used as cooling for the now defunct Hazelwood power station, after a change in national guidelines.Barramundi were released into the 55ha Hazelwood Pondage lake system, which was artificially heated by water cycled through the cooling system for the power station condensers, in April 2016.At the time, Fisheries  recommended consumption be restricted to between two or three servings per week. One serving of barramundi is measured as 150g for adults and 75g for children.The reason for the limited consumption was the presence of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of chemicals used in fire retardants and in a number of other industries, which take a long time to break down in the environment and often build up in fish.There is no evidence showing links between exposure to the substances and health effects in humans, , but some potential adverse health effects have been found in studies in animals.On Monday the EPA issued updated health advice recommending maximum consumption be reduced to one serving per week for adults and one a fortnight for children, in line with  (FSANZ). While the revised health based guideline values has resulted in a change to fish consumption advice, it does not change our understanding of the health effects of PFAS,  EPA Victoria said . The EPA is reassured by advice from the commonwealth department of health that the guideline values used to inform the initial health risk assessment and fish consumption advice was protective of health. There is no reason to expect that consumption of barramundi from Hazelwood Pondage would lead to any specific illness or adverse health effects. The updated FSANZ standards come as residents living near Royal Australian Air Force bases contaminated with PFAS .The fishery opened on 9 December and received 25,000 applications for permits in the first  barra ballot  before fishing was opened up to anyone with a recreational fishing licence on 1 March.The bag limit was set at one barramundi per fisher per day and catches of up to 80cm have been recorded.It is the first of its kind in Victoria and relies on warm water pumped in from both the power plant and nearby coalmine to keep the warm water fish alive.Barramundi require water temperatures of between 26C and 30C to breed and, without heating, the deep artificial lake system will fall well below this range.It is unclear how Fisheries Victoria will keep the lake artificially warmed without the hot water stream from Hazelwood power plant, which shut down on Friday, but the government agency says it is  committed to preserving and developing Hazelwood Pondage as a high-quality recreational fishery . About 40 megalitres of warm water, heated to about 45C, will continue to be pumped into the Hazelwood Pondage every day from the the open-cut coalmine.
