Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party said:  It s outrageous that the government has ploughed a million pounds of taxpayers  money into consultancy for a privatisation that simply shouldn t be happening in the first place. The total figure spent on the sale so far is likely to be higher, given the bidding process began last March. The  1m consultancy cost is included in a disclosure of BEIS s  exceptions to spending controls for July   September 2016 .Vince Cable, , said:  I m sure they will justify it on the basis that they got competitive quotes for their consultants. It does seem rather a lot of money.

It s the issues of policy and principle, rather than these consultant s fees.  The BEIS said:  As with any asset sale, government has engaged external advisers through a competitive process to provide us with access to additional expertise, in line with [National Audit Office] recommendations on best practice.
