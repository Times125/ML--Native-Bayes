Two new artworks by Banksy have appeared at the  centre in central London.The murals, inspired by the upcoming  at the centre, were confirmed as genuine on the artist s verified Instagram account.Announcing the new artworks in a series of posts on Instagram, Banksy said:  Major new Basquiat show    a place that is normally very keen to clean any graffiti from its walls.  The , which is possibly mocking the exhibition, as Basquiat was originally a graffiti artist, is of a ferris wheel with people queueing up at a ticket booth underneath. Crown motifs, common in some of Basquiat s art, replace the wheel s passenger cars. The  is captioned:  Portrait of Basquiat being welcomed by the Metropolitan police   an (unofficial) collaboration with the new Basquiat show. In the second mural, which is clearly inspired by Basquiat s Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump   one of his most famous artworks    has portrayed police officers searching and questioning the boy figure as the dog looks on.It is perhaps a comment how Basquiat, who was one of the first famous black American artists, would be treated if he was working today, given how black people are still much more likely to be  than white. The exhibition, which is the first large-scale UK show of Basquiat s pioneering neo-expressionism, opens on Thursday at the arts centre. It will feature more than 100 works alongside rare photography, film and archive material.It comes nearly 30 years after the artist, DJ, poet and musician, who was also Madonna s former boyfriend, died from a heroin overdose.Banksy, who often makes political points with his art, is also known to support causes he cares about. In May, a  showing a metalworker chipping away at a star on the EU flag appeared in Dover.Last week he donated the  205,000 raised from the  to human rights charity Reprieve and Campaign Against Arms Trade. Civilian Drone Strike, which depicts a trio of Predator drones bombing a child s drawing of a house, was auctioned at Art The Arms Fair, a five-day exhibition coinciding with the Defence and Security Equipment International arms fair in east London last week.
