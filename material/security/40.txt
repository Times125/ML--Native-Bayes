BEIJING -- China is willing to hold constructive discussions with the United States on cyber security, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said at a Monday press briefing. Spokesman Hong Lei's remarks came after U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reportedly expressed concern about growing cyber threats, as well as alleged that the Chinese government and military have been involved in several cyber attacks, during the 12th Shangri-la Dialogue. Hagel said the U.S.-China network work group can help to promote dialogue on cyber security between the two sides, adding that the U.S. would like to enhance cooperation with China on establishing international norms for cyberspace, according to media reports, China and the U.S. have agreed to establish a network work group under the framework of the China-U.S. Strategic Security Dialogue, Hong said. China hopes the two sides can calmly handle cyber security issues, enhance understanding and consensus and jointly build a peaceful, safe, open and cooperative cyberspace environment, he said. China is one of the biggest victims of hacking activities, Hong said. "The Chinese government attaches great importance to the issue and opposes hackers or cyber attacks of any kind," Hong said.
